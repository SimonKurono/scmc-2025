We’ve also made meaningful improvements to the availability of fulfillment data and analytics as well as tools to maintain inventory accuracy which has resulted in improved fulfillment rates in our boutiques. Environment, Social & Governance (""ESG"") As a prominent player in the fashion industry, Aritzia acknowledges the role it must play in accelerating its ESG commitments and performance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain dedicated to making year-over- year progress on our impact priorities and against our targets. At Aritzia, Community refers to the contributions we make to People and the Planet. The Community scope spans Aritzia’s full value chain — from raw material sourcing in our upstream operations, through to product end-of-life in our downstream operations. With the goal to strengthen our positive impact, initiatives and oversight are shared throughout our organization. We seek to take an evidence-based approach and to deliver long-term impact. Our priorities are aligned with the findings in our materiality assessment — which identifies our material impacts, opportunities and risks, as well as The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) reporting framework, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), and the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In Fiscal 2024, we began building on our climate change-related reporting infrastructure in preparation to meet the anticipated reporting requirements of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB)’s Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards (CSDS), as they may be modified by Canadian securities or other regulators. These standards that align with the global baseline standards developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). Consumer Trends The apparel industry is subject to shifts in consumer trends, preferences and consumer spending and our revenue and operating results depend, in part, on our ability to respond to such changes and in a timely manner.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA.pdf

Our revenue is also impacted by discretionary spending by consumers, which is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer debt, inflation, the cost of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather, natural disasters or global pandemics. We believe that our track record demonstrates the success of our exclusive brand strategy at responding to changes in fashion demands through all stages of economic cycles. Seasonality The apparel industry is seasonal in nature, with a higher proportion of net revenue and operating income generated in the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. We also have higher working capital requirements in the periods preceding the launch of new seasons as we receive and pay for new inventory. We manage our working capital needs through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Average quarterly share of annual net revenue over the last three completed fiscal years is as follows: First fiscal quarter 18% Second fiscal quarter 24% Third fiscal quarter 29% Fourth fiscal quarter 29% Yearly total 100% Weather Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our boutiques are located could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our clients to travel to our boutiques and thereby reduce our revenue and profitability. This is potentially mitigated by our clients’ ability to buy our products through aritzia.com. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy to effectively present seasonal inventory.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA.pdf

We are strategically positioned in the global fashion landscape between fast fashion and luxury. We compete with a diverse group of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, fast fashion retailers, athletic retailers and other manufacturers and retailers of branded apparel. Market participants compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of boutiques, eCommerce experience, the breadth, style, quality, price and availability of merchandise, the level of client service and brand recognition. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of several factors that include our strategic mix of exclusive brands, offering of a combination of high quality products at an attainable price point, our refined and proven merchandise planning strategy, our focus on providing an aspirational shopping experience and exceptional client service, our premier real estate portfolio and our market positioning, collectively resulting in a fashion brand loved by our clients all over the world. Foreign Exchange Just over half of our net revenue is derived in U.S. dollars while the vast majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our cost of goods sold could therefore be impacted by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar could materially affect our gross profit margins and operating results. If needed, we will use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada, but there can be no assurances that such strategies will prove to be successful.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

We use non-IFRS financial measures including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, and “Adjusted Net Income”; non-IFRS ratios including “Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share”, ""Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue"", and ""Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue""; and capital management measures including “capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives)”, and “free cash flow.” This MD&A also makes reference to “gross profit margin” as well as ""comparable sales"", which are commonly used operating metrics in the retail industry but may be calculated differently by other retailers. Gross profit margin and comparable sales are considered supplementary financial measures under applicable securities laws. These non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. For definitions of these non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics and reconciliations of these non-IFRS financial measures to the relevant reported measures, please see the “How We Assess the Performance of Our Business” and “Selected Financial Information” sections of this MD&A. HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net revenue reflects our sale of merchandise, less returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is delivered to the customer and therefore may be subject to deferral.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA-18,Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,18,12,13,"Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to, including variable consideration, if any, to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenues are measured net of discounts and an estimated allowance for returns. Revenues are reported net of sales taxes collected for various governmental agencies. Receipts from the sale of gift cards are treated as deferred revenue. When gift cards are redeemed for merchandise, the related revenue is recognized. Comparable sales is a retail industry metric used to explain our total combined revenue growth (decline) (in absolute dollars or percentage terms) in eCommerce and established boutiques over the comparative reportable period. Comparable sales from established boutiques is calculated based on revenue from boutiques that have been opened for at least 56 weeks, and excludes boutiques that were repositioned, boutiques in centres where we opened a new additional boutique and boutiques significantly impacted by nearby construction and other similar disruptions during this period. Our comparable sales calculation excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We apply the relevant prior year comparative’s average monthly exchange rate to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison (i.e., on a constant currency basis). Gross profit reflects our net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes inventory and product- related costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation expense for our boutiques and distribution centres. Our cost of goods sold may include different costs compared to other retailers. Gross profit margin is impacted by the components of cost of goods sold, product mix and markdowns. We define gross profit margin as our gross profit divided by our net revenue. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of selling expenses that are generally variable with net revenue and general and administrative operating expenses that are primarily fixed. Our SG&A expenses also include depreciation and amortization expenses for all support office assets and intangible assets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA.pdf

Our SG&A expenses may include different expenses compared to other retailers. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense. We believe this measure is useful as it is used by management as a component of reconciliation between other non-IFRS measures and their most comparable IFRS measure. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of operating performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of operating results in that the measures exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by removing the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense, adjusted for the impact of certain items, including non-cash items and/or items we consider non-recurring and not representative of our ongoing operating performance, such as stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gains or losses on equity derivative and forward contracts, a deduction of interest expense and depreciation relating to our leases to reflect an estimate of rent expense, and fair value adjustments on NCI in exchangeable shares liability. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges.

We define Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. We define Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted Net Income by net revenue. Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) is a measure we believe to be a useful indicator of the net cash capital investment relating to our boutiques and infrastructure. We define capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) as cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used in business combinations, less proceeds from lease incentives. Free cash flow is a useful metric because it is an indicator of how much cash is available for business acquisitions, debt repayment, share repurchases and other investing and financing activities. Our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an indicator of the financial strength of our business, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain boutiques and invest in infrastructure.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best judgments and experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Return Allowances Recognizing provisions for sales return allowances requires the use of estimates of the return rate of merchandise based on historical return patterns. Valuation of Finished Goods Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA.pdf

Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing requires the use of estimates in the impairment testing model. On an annual basis, we test whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired. The recoverable value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate estimates regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. We use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify our cash generating units (""CGUs"") for purposes of testing for impairment. In testing for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which involves judgment. Leases We estimate the incremental borrowing rate used for calculating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset as the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. We exercise judgment in determining the appropriate lease term at the lease commencement date. We exercise judgment on whether we will exercise available renewal or termination options, and thus include such options in the lease terms. We consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal or termination option. ACCOUNTING POLICY DEVELOPMENTS Several amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards apply for the first time in 2024 but do not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company (see discussion in the Company's Fiscal 2024 MD&A). The International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in the Financial Statements, in April 2024 which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027.

Our overall risk management program and business practices seek to minimize any potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial performance. Risk management is carried out under practices approved by our Audit Committee. This includes reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on the adequacy of our risk management policies and procedures with regard to identifying the Company’s principal risks and implementing appropriate systems and controls to manage these risks. Risk management covers many areas of risk including, but not limited to, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and equity price risk. Foreign Exchange Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America with the vast majority of purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign exchange risk is primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar but we have limited exposure to other currencies as well. We may use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada. As at June 2, 2024, we have no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding and none were utilized during the 13-week period ended June 2, 2024. Interest Rate Risk We have a revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit which provides available borrowings in an amount up to $300.0 million and US$10 million, respectively. Because the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding balances. As at June 2, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and the revolving line of credit. Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the possibility of an unexpected event if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivative contracts used to hedge market risks. We are exposed to minimal credit risk.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2025-MDA.pdf

We are exposed to credit risk on receivables from our landlords in relation to tenant improvement allowances. To reduce this risk, we enter into leases with landlords with established credit history, and for certain leases, we may offset rent payments until accounts receivable are fully satisfied. We only enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions, as described above and as needed, for the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we cannot meet a demand for cash or fund our obligations as they come due. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account the seasonality of our revenue, income, working capital and capital expenditure needs. The revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit are used to maintain liquidity. As at June 2, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to risk arising from the cash settlement of our deferred and restricted share units, as an appreciating subordinate voting share price increases the potential cash outflow. We record a liability for the potential future settlement of our deferred and restricted share units by reference to the fair value of the liability. We may use equity derivative contracts to offset our cash flow variability of the expected payment associated with our deferred and restricted share units. We only enter into equity derivative contracts with major financial institutions. As at June 2, 2024, the fair value of the equity derivative contract was in an asset position of $3.6 million.

The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting include, but are not limited to, detailed policies and procedures relating to financial accounting and reporting, and controls over systems that process and summarize transactions. The Company’s procedures for financial reporting also include the active involvement of qualified financial professionals, senior management and its Audit Committee. In designing such controls, it should be recognized that due to inherent limitations, any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, management is required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Therefore, even when determined to be designed effectively, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Our Brand and Products Our exclusive mix of fashion brands offer a strategic and thoughtfully conceived, designed, and developed collection of products.

Our expansive and diverse range of fashion apparel and accessories addresses a broad range of style preferences and lifestyle requirements for our clients, producing strong and enduring client loyalty.

Our strategy centers on our ability to create enough new styles to maintain freshness in our assortment over time. Our technical team ensures all products are executed in a manner that is consistent with our design and delivers superior fit and sophisticated construction in the production of our exclusive brands. We partner with high quality mills and suppliers to create and sample garments, which are fit-tested before production. We strive to ensure that the quality of our raw materials and the finished product are all held to our Everyday Luxury™ standards and the expectations of our clients. Merchandise Planning Our demand-driven merchandise planning, buying and inventory strategies have been developed and evolved for over 40 years. We generate a meaningful proportion of revenue from our client favourites while helping to drive excitement through new seasonal product assortment. We analyze sales data in order to make inventory adjustments and to respond to the latest trends. Our inventory management processes and systems provide us with the ability to optimize inventory across geographies and channels to ensure that each boutique and aritzia.com is merchandised with products that resonate with local preferences. We actively monitor sell-through rates and manage the mix of product categories in our boutiques and aritzia.com. We respond to emerging trends in a timely manner, minimize our dependence on any particular category, style or fabrication and preserve a balanced, coordinated presentation of merchandise within each boutique while offering our client the entire assortment online. We believe that our disciplined merchandise planning strategy enables us to optimize inventory levels and maximize full-price sales. Sourcing and Production We contract and maintain direct relationships with a diversified base of independent suppliers and manufacturers for our exclusive brands who provide us with the flexibility to source high quality materials and products at competitive costs. We believe that our approach of sourcing a majority of our raw materials and working directly with suppliers and manufacturers enhances our ability to create beautiful and high-quality products in a timely manner.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

Our finished goods are sourced from manufacturers located in countries, including but not limited to, Austria, Cambodia, China, Guatemala, India, Italy, Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, the U.S. and Vietnam. We continue to monitor and diversify our supplier base, taking into consideration the geo-political and economic environment to mitigate risk. “Next Generation Suppliers” are finished goods partners that have implemented succession planning as part of their strategy, are digitally enabled, manufacture multiple categories of materials and products and have multiple country of origin footprints and investments in automation. We leverage our “Next Generation Supplier” relationships by using their multi origin footprint to pivot as geopolitical obstacles arise without interrupting our product lifecycle. Capacity planning with our manufacturers is done at the beginning of the season to help ensure flexibility. We engage third parties to inspect our manufacturers’ factories to help maintain quality control and engage independent expert service providers to conduct factory audits for compliance with local laws and regulations and global standards. We have launched a vendor self-certification process for quality assurance and inspection. We believe this will help ensure a greater execution of our quality expectations and to allow for vendors to reduce cycle time. We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct and initiatives to increase transparency with respect to the origins of our raw materials. Boutiques We have developed our boutique network in a measured and disciplined manner. We have a portfolio of boutiques situated in premier real estate locations in high performing retail malls and high streets in Canada and the United States. Our strong boutique sales productivity continues to make us a sought-after tenant for top quality locations in premier shopping destinations.

Aritzia is focused on improving the Digital experience across all devices (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet) to work towards making shopping even more frictionless than it is today. The core areas of our client’s digital journey including discovery, evaluating, and purchase are continuously improved. Distribution Facilities Our current distribution network consists of three distribution centres, two in Canada and one in the United States, that are well positioned to service our boutiques and Digital business. Our distribution centres include a 223,000 square foot facility in New Westminster, British Columbia, a 550,000 square foot facility in Vaughan, Ontario, and a 560,000 square foot third-party facility in Columbus, Ohio. We operate our distribution centres located in New Westminster, British Columbia and Vaughan, Ontario, while the distribution centre located in Columbus, Ohio is operated by a third-party logistics provider. Our inventory is centrally managed and shared amongst our boutiques and Digital business. In Fiscal 2024, we opened our 550,000 square foot distribution centre in Vaughan, Ontario. This facility is in- sourced and replaced our previous 150,000 square foot facility operated by a third-party logistics provider in Mississauga, Ontario.

We plan to complete retrofitting work in this facility in Fiscal 2026 to help optimize our operations. In Fiscal 2025, construction activities commenced on a new 380,000 square foot facility in Delta, British Columbia. We started finalizing plans for construction and design along with starting some construction activities at the end of Fiscal 2025. When completed, this new facility will be operated by us and is expected to be operational in early Fiscal 2027. We plan to retain our current facility in New Westminster, British Columbia for storage and office space purposes, among other things. We plan on implementing increased automation, including robotic equipment in this new facility to increase our efficiencies and throughput. Our current facilities are set up to flexibly manage multi-channel and Omni channel demands, as our business continues to grow, and these further expansions will also support both our retail and Digital businesses with added capacity to handle higher levels of throughput. Omni-Channel Capabilities In Fiscal 2025, we successfully ramped up Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store and stabilized our Buy Online, Ship From Store capabilities. These new capabilities enabled us to maximize sales and profitability by offering customers more order options. Our Omni channel was built on the foundation of our point-of-sale system and investment in digital selling tools to enable omni-channel capabilities and optimize our technical systems and architecture. The project brought to life a new order fulfillment solution, the physical optimization of our backroom spaces, foundational order sourcing technology, and enhancements to our digital customer experience. The Omni channel capabilities are as follows: • Buy Online, Ship From Store – Available in most boutiques in Canada and the U.S., this capability introduces store inventory online, ensuring our full product assortment is available on aritzia.com.

Building on store inventory visibility, this capability further integrates the online and in-store experiences leveraging the strong service in our boutiques to deliver an elevated, yet convenient experience. It is expected to also drive traffic to our boutiques and lead to additional opportunities for purchases upon pick up. • Store Inventory Visibility – This functionality enhances the client experience on aritzia.com by providing visibility of product availability in our boutiques. This initiative drives cross-channel shopping behavior and reduces contacts to our Concierge team by enabling clients to self-serve on common product availability related questions. We’ve also made meaningful improvements to the availability of fulfillment data and analytics as well as tools to maintain inventory accuracy and management which has resulted in improved fulfillment rates in stores. Impact and Governance Reflecting the importance of sustainability-related risks and opportunities to our business and brands, and as a prominent player in the fashion industry, Aritzia believes it has a role to play in advancing sustainability matters. As our business grows, so does our potential to create lasting change - we remain committed to advancing our Impact goals year-over-year progress. We are strengthening our efforts to deliver Everyday Luxury™ responsibly and sustainably. At Aritzia, Impact refers to the contributions we make to People and the Planet across our full value chain - from raw material sourcing through to product end-of-life. As we continue to grow our business, we're deepening our efforts to embed sustainability into how we operate - focusing on the areas where we can make the greatest positive impact. Across our supply chain, we are aiming to invest in preferred materials (terminology used by the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit setting industry standards for sustainable fibers and materials to improve clarity and comparability) and collaborating with partners to advance responsible practices. We believe these contributions matter to our clients and we seek to take an evidence-based approach and to deliver long-term positive impact for the benefit of our business resilience and our stakeholders.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

In Fiscal 2025, we expanded our climate strategy setting science-based emissions reduction targets. We continued to support the communities we serve through product donations, financial support and employee volunteer hours. We enhanced our support for employees through expanded parenthood benefits and remained committed to our belonging and inclusion initiatives. Consumer Trends The apparel industry is subject to shifts in consumer trends, preferences and consumer spending and our revenue and operating results depend, in part, on our ability to respond to such changes and in a timely manner. Our differentiated multi-brand strategy gives us control over our products and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in consumer demand and fashion preferences, which has historically been a critical driver of our growth. Our revenue is also impacted by discretionary spending by consumers, which is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, tariff and international trade policies that could put pressure on our pricing, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer debt, inflation, the cost of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather, natural disasters or global pandemics. We believe that our track record demonstrates the success of our exclusive brand strategy at responding to changes in fashion demands through all stages of economic cycles. Seasonality The apparel industry is seasonal in nature, with a higher proportion of net revenue and operating income generated in the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. We also have higher working capital requirements in the periods preceding the launch of new seasons as we receive and pay for new inventory. We manage our working capital needs through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Average quarterly share of annual net revenue over the last three completed fiscal years is as follows: First fiscal quarter 19% Second fiscal quarter 23% Third fiscal quarter 28% Fourth fiscal quarter 30% Yearly total 100% Weather Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our boutiques are located could adversely affect our business and financial results.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

This is potentially mitigated by our clients’ ability to buy our products through aritzia.com. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy to effectively present seasonal inventory. Further, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could materially impact our supply chain network. Competition We operate in the apparel industry, primarily within the Canadian and United States markets. We are strategically positioned in the global fashion landscape between fast fashion and luxury. We compete with a diverse group of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, fast fashion retailers, athletic retailers and other manufacturers and retailers of branded apparel. Market participants compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of boutiques, eCommerce experience, the breadth, style, quality, price and availability of merchandise, the level of client service and brand recognition. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of several factors that include our strategic mix of exclusive brands and iconically Aritzia products, offering of a combination of high quality products at an attainable price point, our refined and evolving merchandise planning strategy, our focus on providing an aspirational shopping experience and exceptional client service, our premier real estate portfolio, captivating content and communications, and our market positioning, collectively resulting in a fashion brand loved by our clients all over the world. Foreign Exchange Over half of our net revenue is derived in U.S. dollars and the vast majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Both our net revenues and cost of goods sold could be impacted significantly by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

See the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RETAIL INDUSTRY METRICS This MD&A makes reference to certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures (""non-IFRS financial measures"") and certain retail industry metrics. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS Accounting Standards, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS Accounting Standards measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS Accounting Standards. We use non-IFRS financial measures including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, and “Adjusted Net Income”; non-IFRS Accounting Standards ratios (""non-IFRS ratios"") including “Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share”, ""Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue"", and ""Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue""; and capital management measures including “capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives)”, and “free cash flow.” This MD&A also makes reference to “gross profit margin”, ""comparable sales"", and ""constant currency"" which are commonly used operating metrics in the retail industry but may be calculated differently by other retailers. Gross profit margin, comparable sales and constant currency are considered supplementary financial measures under applicable securities laws. These non-IFRS financial measures and retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS Accounting Standards measures.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

For definitions of these non-IFRS financial measures and retail industry metrics and reconciliations of these non-IFRS financial measures to the relevant reported measures, please see the “How We Assess the Performance of Our Business” and “Selected Financial Information” sections of this MD&A. HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net revenue reflects our sale of merchandise, less returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is delivered to the customer and therefore may be subject to deferral. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to, including variable consideration, if any, to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenues are measured net of discounts and an estimated allowance for returns. Revenues are reported net of sales taxes collected for various governmental agencies. Receipts from the sale of gift cards are treated as deferred revenue. When gift cards are redeemed for merchandise, the related revenue is recognized. Comparable sales is a retail industry metric used to explain our total combined revenue growth (decline) (in absolute dollars or percentage terms) in eCommerce and established boutiques over the comparative reportable period. Comparable sales from established boutiques is calculated based on revenue from boutiques that have been opened for at least 56 weeks, and excludes boutiques that were repositioned, boutiques in centres where we opened a new additional boutique and boutiques significantly impacted by nearby construction and other similar disruptions during this period. Our comparable sales calculation excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA-20,Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,20,13,13,"We apply the relevant prior year comparative’s average foreign currency exchange rate for the period to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison (i.e., on a constant currency basis). Constant currency change in net revenue assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. The constant currency change helps provide investors an understanding of the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit reflects our net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes inventory and product- related costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation expense for our boutiques and distribution centres. Our cost of goods sold may include different costs compared to other retailers. Gross profit margin is impacted by the components of cost of goods sold, product mix and markdowns. We define gross profit margin as our gross profit divided by our net revenue. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of selling expenses that are generally variable with net revenue and general and administrative operating expenses that are primarily fixed. Our SG&A expenses also include depreciation and amortization expenses for all support office assets and intangible assets. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue, excluding strategic investments in technology and infrastructure, are usually higher in the lower net revenue volume first and second quarters, and lower in the higher net revenue volume third and fourth quarters because a portion of these costs are relatively fixed. Our SG&A expenses may include different expenses compared to other retailers. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense. We believe this measure is useful as it is used by management as a component of reconciliation between other non-IFRS financial measures and their most comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense, adjusted for the impact of certain items, such as a deduction of interest expense and depreciation relating to our leases to reflect an estimate of rent expense and including non-cash items and/or items we consider non-recurring and not representative of our ongoing operating performance, such as stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gains or losses on equity derivative and forward contracts and other similar fair value adjustments. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by net revenue. Adjusted Net Income (and per Diluted Share) and Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses.

We define Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted Net Income by net revenue. Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) is a measure we believe to be a useful indicator of the net cash capital investment relating to our boutiques and infrastructure. We define capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) as cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used in business combinations and other acquisitions, less proceeds from lease incentives. Free cash flow is a useful metric because it is an indicator of how much cash is available for business acquisitions, debt repayment, share repurchases and other investing and financing activities. Our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an indicator of the financial strength of our business, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain boutiques and invest in infrastructure.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA-34,Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,34,20,21,"Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best judgments and experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Return Allowances Recognizing provisions for sales return allowances requires the use of estimates of the return rate of merchandise based on historical return patterns. Valuation of Finished Goods Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions which requires the use of estimates related to product quality, damages, inventory shrinkage for lost or stolen items, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing requires the use of estimates in the impairment testing model. On an annual basis, we test whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired. The recoverable value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate estimates regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. We use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify our cash generating units (""CGUs"") for purposes of testing for impairment. In testing for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which involves judgment. Leases We estimate the incremental borrowing rate used for calculating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset as the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. We exercise judgment in determining the appropriate lease term at the lease commencement date. We exercise judgment on whether we will exercise available renewal or termination options, and thus include such options in the lease terms.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

ACCOUNTING POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (""IFRS 9"") and IFRS Financial Instruments: Disclosures (""IFRS 7"") In May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"") issued amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures to clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of some financial assets and liabilities, with a new exception for some financial liabilities settled through an electronic cash transfer system, clarify and add further guidance for assessing whether a financial asset meets the solely payments of principal and interest (""SPPI"") criterion, add new disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change cash flows (such as instruments with features linked to the achievement of environmental and social targets), and update the disclosure of equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (""FVOCI""). These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. Early adoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt only the amendments to the classification of financial assets. The Company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure to the Financial Statements (""IFRS 18"") The IASB issued IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in the Financial Statements, in April 2024 which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027. The new standard will establish a revised structure for the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and improve comparability across entities and reporting periods. The standard will be applied retroactively, with certain transition provisions. The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 18 on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks in the normal course of operations including geopolitical and macroeconomic, foreign exchange, interest rate, credit, liquidity and equity price risk, as summarized below. Our overall risk management program and business practices seek to minimize any potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial performance. Risk management is carried out under practices approved by our Audit Committee.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA-36,Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,36,21,22,"This includes reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on the adequacy of our risk management policies and procedures with regard to identifying the Company’s principal risks and implementing appropriate systems and controls to manage these risks. Risk management covers many areas of risk including, but not limited to, geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and equity price risk. Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America and generate over half of our net revenues from the United States and so are dependent on international trade relations, agreements and regulations. Recent executive orders have been issued by the U.S. President, directing the U.S. to impose new or increased tariffs on certain of its trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China, and on other countries in which our products are produced or sold. It remains unclear the extent to which additional quotas, duties, tariffs, sanctions and/or other trade restrictions or other similar or retaliatory measures may be imposed by Canada, the United States or other countries, whether and if any changes to the currently announced tariffs will be applied, how long they may be in effect, the extent to which further retaliatory measures will be imposed, the nature of the goods that will be subject to such tariffs and whether other factors will support a pass through of all or a part of the tariffs to the market. The disruptions caused by the threat of, the potential or actual imposition of, and increases in the rate or scope of, such quotas, duties, tariffs, sanctions and other trade restrictions or other similar measures (and any retaliatory measures) could adversely impact the profitability of our business, financial condition and results of operations. General economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other parts of the world, including lower levels of consumer spending, economic volatility, and international trade policies and tariffs, can affect consumer confidence and consumer purchases of discretionary items, including fashion apparel and related products such as ours.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA-37,Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,37,22,22,"Therefore, demand for our products may be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, which could worsen as a result of the imposition of new duties, tariffs and other trade restrictions or other similar measures. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Foreign Exchange Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America with the vast majority of purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. This risk is partially mitigated with over half of our net revenues generated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign exchange risk is primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar but we have limited exposure to other currencies as well. We may use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada. As at June 1, 2025, we have no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding and none were utilized during the 13-week period ended June 1, 2025. Interest Rate Risk We have a revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit which provides available borrowings in an amount up to $300.0 million and US$10 million, respectively. Because the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding balances. As at June 1, 2025, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and the revolving line of credit. Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the possibility of an unexpected event if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivative contracts used to hedge market risks. We are exposed to minimal credit risk. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions that have been assigned high credit ratings by internationally recognized credit rating agencies. We are exposed to credit risk on receivables from our landlords in relation to tenant improvement allowances.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA-38,Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,38,22,23,"To reduce this risk, we enter into leases with landlords with established credit history, and for certain leases, we may offset rent payments until accounts receivable are fully satisfied. We only enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions, as described above and as needed, for the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we cannot meet a demand for cash or fund our obligations as they come due. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account the seasonality of our revenue, income, working capital and capital expenditure needs. The revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit are used to maintain liquidity. As at June 1, 2025, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to risk arising from the cash settlement of our deferred and restricted share units, as an appreciating subordinate voting share price increases the potential cash outflow. We record a liability for the potential future settlement of our deferred and restricted share units by reference to the fair value of the liability. We may use equity derivative contracts to offset our cash flow variability of the expected payment associated with our deferred and restricted share units. We only enter into equity derivative contracts with major financial institutions. As at June 1, 2025, the fair value of the equity derivative contract was in an asset position of $21.2 million. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures over the public disclosure of financial and non-financial information regarding the Company. Such controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, so that they can make appropriate and timely decisions regarding public disclosure. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial reports for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q1-2026-MDA.pdf

The Company’s procedures for financial reporting also include the active involvement of qualified financial professionals, senior management and its Audit Committee. In designing such controls, it should be recognized that due to inherent limitations, any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, management is required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Therefore, even when determined to be designed effectively, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during Q1 2026 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our Brand and Products Our exclusive mix of fashion brands offer a strategic and thoughtfully conceived, designed, and developed collection of products. In addition to our exclusive fashion brands, we also position product under the Aritzia brand. Aritzia-branded products are beloved styles and fabrics that — of everything we make — are the most iconically Aritzia. We believe that a key area of differentiation for us is that we design apparel and accessories to enable us to reach many different groups of clients. Our sourcing and manufacturing strategy gives us control over our supply chain and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in client demand and fashion preferences. This has been critical to our ability to grow while also reducing risk.

We strive to maintain a flexible mix of historically successful items and new seasonal styles. Our changing product mix is a blended reflection of client demands and fashion direction. This strategic mix helps us to drive client conversion by delivering fashion must- haves, while still generating a meaningful proportion of revenue from our fashion essentials.

Merchandise Planning Our demand-driven merchandise planning, buying and inventory strategies have been developed and refined for 40 years. We generate a meaningful proportion of revenue from our client favourites while helping to drive excitement through new seasonal product assortment. We analyze sales data in order to make inventory adjustments and to respond to the latest trends. Our inventory management processes and systems provide us with the ability to optimize inventory across geographies and channels to ensure that each boutique and aritzia.com is merchandised with products that resonate with local preferences. We actively monitor sell-through rates and manage the mix of product categories in our boutiques and aritzia.com.

Capacity planning with our manufacturers is done at the beginning of the season to help ensure flexibility. We engage third parties to inspect our manufacturers’ factories to help ensure quality control and engage independent expert service providers to conduct factory audits for compliance with local laws and regulations and global standards. We have launched a vendor self-certification process for quality assurance and inspection. We believe this will help ensure a greater execution of our quality expectations and to allow for vendors to reduce cycle time. We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct and initiatives to increase transparency with respect to the origins of our raw materials. Boutiques We have developed our boutique network in a measured and disciplined manner. We have a portfolio of boutiques situated in premier real estate locations in high performing retail malls and high streets in Canada and the United States. Our strong boutique sales productivity continues to make us a sought-after tenant for top quality locations in premier shopping destinations. In addition to opening new boutiques, we generate attractive returns on capital by enhancing elements of our existing boutiques (including footprint, layout and assortment) through carefully considered boutique repositions.

Distribution Facilities Our current distribution network consists of three distribution centres, two in Canada and one in the United States, that are well positioned to service our boutiques and eCommerce business. Our distribution centres include a 223,000 square foot facility in New Westminster, British Columbia, our recently opened 550,000 square foot facility in Vaughan, Ontario, and a 560,000 square foot third-party facility in Columbus, Ohio. We operate our distribution centres located in New Westminster, British Columbia and Vaughan, Ontario, while the distribution centre located in Columbus, Ohio is operated by a third-party logistics provider. Our inventory is centrally managed and shared amongst our boutiques and eCommerce business. In Fiscal 2024, we opened our 550,000 square foot distribution centre in Vaughan, Ontario. This new facility is in- sourced and replaces our previous 150,000 square foot facility operated by a third-party logistics provider in Mississauga, Ontario. In Fiscal 2024, construction commenced on a new 380,000 square foot facility in Delta, British Columbia. When completed, this new facility will be operated by us and is expected to be operational in late Fiscal 2026. We plan to retain our current facility in New Westminster, British Columbia for storage and office space purposes, among other things. We plan on implementing increased automation, including robotic equipment in this new facility to increase our efficiencies and throughput. In Fiscal 2024, we expanded and took over the entire building in our Columbus, Ohio distribution centre, resulting in an additional 305,000 square feet for a total of approximately 560,000 square feet in that facility. We began retrofitting work in this facility in Fiscal 2025 to help optimize our operations.

The Omni Project is built on the foundation of our point-of-sale system and investment in digital selling tools to enable omni-channel capabilities and optimize our technical systems and architecture. The project brought to life a new order fulfillment solution, the physical optimization of our backroom spaces, foundational order sourcing technology, and enhancements to our digital customer experience. The omni channel capabilities are as follows: • Buy Online, Ship From Store – Available in most of our boutiques, this new capability introduces store inventory online, ensuring our full product assortment is available on aritzia.com. It also enables strategic targeting of inventory across our network of boutiques and minimizes delivery time to our clients. • Buy Online, Pick-up In Store – Available in most of our boutiques, this capability provides clients with the option to pick up their online order in store.

At Aritzia, Community refers to the contributions we make to People and the Planet. The Community scope spans Aritzia’s full value chain — from raw material sourcing in our upstream operations, through to product end-of-life in our downstream operations. With the goal to strengthen our positive impact, initiatives and oversight are shared throughout our organization. We seek to take an evidence-based approach and to deliver long-term impact. Our priorities are aligned with the findings in our materiality assessment — which identifies our material impacts, opportunities and risks, as well as The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) reporting framework, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), and the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In Fiscal 2024, we began building on our climate change-related reporting infrastructure in preparation to meet the anticipated reporting requirements of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB)’s Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards (CSDS), as they may be modified by Canadian securities or other regulators. These standards align with the global baseline standards developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

Our differentiated multi-brand strategy gives us control over our products and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in consumer demand and fashion preferences, which has historically been a critical driver of our growth. Our revenue is also impacted by discretionary spending by consumers, which is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer debt, inflation, the cost of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather, natural disasters or global pandemics.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf

Seasonality The apparel industry is seasonal in nature, with a higher proportion of net revenue and operating income generated in the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. We also have higher working capital requirements in the periods preceding the launch of new seasons as we receive and pay for new inventory. We manage our working capital needs through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Average quarterly share of annual net revenue over the last three completed fiscal years is as follows: First fiscal quarter 18% Second fiscal quarter 24% Third fiscal quarter 29% Fourth fiscal quarter 29% Yearly total 100% Weather Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our boutiques are located could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our clients to travel to our boutiques and thereby reduce our revenue and profitability. This is potentially mitigated by our clients’ ability to buy our products through aritzia.com. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy to effectively present seasonal inventory. Competition We operate in the apparel industry, primarily within the Canadian and United States markets. We are strategically positioned in the global fashion landscape between fast fashion and luxury. We compete with a diverse group of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, fast fashion retailers, athletic retailers and other manufacturers and retailers of branded apparel.

Foreign Exchange Over half of our net revenue is derived in U.S. dollars while the vast majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our cost of goods sold could therefore be impacted by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar could materially affect our gross profit margins and operating results. If needed, we will use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada, but there can be no assurances that such strategies will prove to be successful. See the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A. NON-IFRS MEASURES AND RETAIL INDUSTRY METRICS This MD&A makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures and certain retail industry metrics. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA-20,Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,20,12,13,"We use non-IFRS financial measures including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, and “Adjusted Net Income”; non-IFRS ratios including “Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share”, ""Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue"", and ""Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue""; and capital management measures including “capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives)”, and “free cash flow.” This MD&A also makes reference to “gross profit margin” as well as ""comparable sales"", which are commonly used operating metrics in the retail industry but may be calculated differently by other retailers. Gross profit margin and comparable sales are considered supplementary financial measures under applicable securities laws. These non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. For definitions of these non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics and reconciliations of these non-IFRS financial measures to the relevant reported measures, please see the “How We Assess the Performance of Our Business” and “Selected Financial Information” sections of this MD&A. HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net revenue reflects our sale of merchandise, less returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is delivered to the customer and therefore may be subject to deferral.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA-21,Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,21,13,13,"Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to, including variable consideration, if any, to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenues are measured net of discounts and an estimated allowance for returns. Revenues are reported net of sales taxes collected for various governmental agencies. Receipts from the sale of gift cards are treated as deferred revenue. When gift cards are redeemed for merchandise, the related revenue is recognized. Comparable sales is a retail industry metric used to explain our total combined revenue growth (decline) (in absolute dollars or percentage terms) in eCommerce and established boutiques over the comparative reportable period. Comparable sales from established boutiques is calculated based on revenue from boutiques that have been opened for at least 56 weeks, and excludes boutiques that were repositioned, boutiques in centres where we opened a new additional boutique and boutiques significantly impacted by nearby construction and other similar disruptions during this period. Our comparable sales calculation excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We apply the relevant prior year comparative’s average monthly exchange rate to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison (i.e., on a constant currency basis). Gross profit reflects our net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes inventory and product- related costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation expense for our boutiques and distribution centres. Our cost of goods sold may include different costs compared to other retailers. Gross profit margin is impacted by the components of cost of goods sold, product mix and markdowns. We define gross profit margin as our gross profit divided by our net revenue. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of selling expenses that are generally variable with net revenue and general and administrative operating expenses that are primarily fixed. Our SG&A expenses also include depreciation and amortization expenses for all support office assets and intangible assets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf

Our SG&A expenses may include different expenses compared to other retailers. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense. We believe this measure is useful as it is used by management as a component of reconciliation between other non-IFRS measures and their most comparable IFRS measure. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of operating performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of operating results in that the measures exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by removing the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense, adjusted for the impact of certain items, such as a deduction of interest expense and depreciation relating to our leases to reflect an estimate of rent expense and including non-cash items and/or items we consider non-recurring and not representative of our ongoing operating performance, such as stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gains or losses on equity derivative and forward contracts and fair value adjustments on NCI in exchangeable shares liability. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges.

We define Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. We define Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted Net Income by net revenue. Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) is a measure we believe to be a useful indicator of the net cash capital investment relating to our boutiques and infrastructure. We define capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) as cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used in business combinations, less proceeds from lease incentives. Free cash flow is a useful metric because it is an indicator of how much cash is available for business acquisitions, debt repayment, share repurchases and other investing and financing activities. Our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an indicator of the financial strength of our business, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain boutiques and invest in infrastructure.

We believe that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit, are expected to be sufficient to meet our future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks). Our ability to fund future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks) will depend on, among other things, our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial and other factors, including factors beyond our control.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best judgments and experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Return Allowances Recognizing provisions for sales return allowances requires the use of estimates of the return rate of merchandise based on historical return patterns. Valuation of Finished Goods Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions which requires the use of estimates related to product quality, damages, inventory shrinkage for lost or stolen items, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing requires the use of estimates in the impairment testing model. On an annual basis, we test whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired. The recoverable value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate estimates regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. We use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify our cash generating units (""CGUs"") for purposes of testing for impairment. In testing for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which involves judgment. Leases We estimate the incremental borrowing rate used for calculating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA-43,Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,43,24,24,"We estimate the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset as the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. We exercise judgment in determining the appropriate lease term at the lease commencement date. We exercise judgment on whether we will exercise available renewal or termination options, and thus include such options in the lease terms. We consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal or termination option. ACCOUNTING POLICY DEVELOPMENTS Several amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards apply for the first time in 2024 but do not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company (see discussion in the Company's Fiscal 2024 MD&A). The International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in the Financial Statements, in April 2024 which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027. Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 18. In addition, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks in the normal course of operations including foreign exchange, interest rate, credit, liquidity and equity price risk, as summarized below. Our overall risk management program and business practices seek to minimize any potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial performance. Risk management is carried out under practices approved by our Audit Committee. This includes reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on the adequacy of our risk management policies and procedures with regard to identifying the Company’s principal risks and implementing appropriate systems and controls to manage these risks. Risk management covers many areas of risk including, but not limited to, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and equity price risk. Foreign Exchange Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America with the vast majority of purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign exchange risk is primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar but we have limited exposure to other currencies as well.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf

As at September 1, 2024, we have no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding and none were utilized during the 26-week period ended September 1, 2024. Interest Rate Risk We have a revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit which provides available borrowings in an amount up to $300.0 million and US$10 million, respectively. Because the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding balances. As at September 1, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and the revolving line of credit. Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the possibility of an unexpected event if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivative contracts used to hedge market risks. We are exposed to minimal credit risk. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions that have been assigned high credit ratings by internationally recognized credit rating agencies. We are exposed to credit risk on receivables from our landlords in relation to tenant improvement allowances. To reduce this risk, we enter into leases with landlords with established credit history, and for certain leases, we may offset rent payments until accounts receivable are fully satisfied. We only enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions, as described above and as needed, for the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we cannot meet a demand for cash or fund our obligations as they come due. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account the seasonality of our revenue, income, working capital and capital expenditure needs. The revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit are used to maintain liquidity. As at September 1, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf

We record a liability for the potential future settlement of our deferred and restricted share units by reference to the fair value of the liability. We may use equity derivative contracts to offset our cash flow variability of the expected payment associated with our deferred and restricted share units. We only enter into equity derivative contracts with major financial institutions. As at September 1, 2024, the fair value of the equity derivative contract was in an asset position of $10.1 million. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures over the public disclosure of financial and non-financial information regarding the Company. Such controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, so that they can make appropriate and timely decisions regarding public disclosure. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial reports for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting include, but are not limited to, detailed policies and procedures relating to financial accounting and reporting, and controls over systems that process and summarize transactions. The Company’s procedures for financial reporting also include the active involvement of qualified financial professionals, senior management and its Audit Committee. In designing such controls, it should be recognized that due to inherent limitations, any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, management is required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Therefore, even when determined to be designed effectively, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2025-MDA.pdf

We respond to emerging trends in a timely manner, minimize our dependence on any particular category, style or fabrication and preserve a balanced, coordinated presentation of merchandise within each boutique while offering our client the entire assortment online. We believe that our disciplined merchandise planning strategy enables us to optimize inventory levels and maximize full-price sales. Sourcing and Production We contract and maintain direct relationships with a diversified base of independent suppliers and manufacturers for our exclusive brands who provide us with the flexibility to source high quality materials and products at competitive costs. We believe that our approach of sourcing a majority of our raw materials and working directly with suppliers and manufacturers enhances our ability to create beautiful and high-quality products in a timely manner. We source the majority of our raw materials directly from mills, trim suppliers and manufacturers in overseas markets, which we believe to be best in class, located primarily in China, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that uphold our standards for quality, lead time and cost. Our finished goods are sourced from manufacturers located in countries, including but not limited to, Austria, Cambodia, China, Guatemala, India, Italy, Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, the U.S. and Vietnam. We continue to monitor and diversify our supplier base, taking into consideration the geo-political and economic environment to mitigate risk.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

We leverage our “Next Generation Supplier” relationships by using their multi origin footprint to pivot as geopolitical obstacles arise without interrupting our product lifecycle. Capacity planning with our manufacturers is done at the beginning of the season to help ensure flexibility. We engage third parties to inspect our manufacturers’ factories to help maintain quality control and engage independent expert service providers to conduct factory audits for compliance with local laws and regulations and global standards. We have launched a vendor self-certification process for quality assurance and inspection. We believe this will help ensure a greater execution of our quality expectations and to allow for vendors to reduce cycle time. We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct and initiatives to increase transparency with respect to the origins of our raw materials. Boutiques We have developed our boutique network in a measured and disciplined manner. We have a portfolio of boutiques situated in premier real estate locations in high performing retail malls and high streets in Canada and the United States. Our strong boutique sales productivity continues to make us a sought-after tenant for top quality locations in premier shopping destinations. In addition to opening new boutiques, we generate attractive returns on capital by enhancing elements of our existing boutiques (including footprint, layout and assortment) through carefully considered boutique repositions, relocations and expansions. We continue to elevate our boutique design and believe we deliver a fully immersive experience including enhancing the sensory experience by adding A-OK cafes in select boutiques.

Distribution Facilities Our current distribution network consists of three distribution centres, two in Canada and one in the United States, that are well positioned to service our boutiques and Digital business. Our distribution centres include a 223,000 square foot facility in New Westminster, British Columbia, a 550,000 square foot facility in Vaughan, Ontario, and a 560,000 square foot third-party facility in Columbus, Ohio. We operate our distribution centres located in New Westminster, British Columbia and Vaughan, Ontario, while the distribution centre located in Columbus, Ohio is operated by a third-party logistics provider. Our inventory is centrally managed and shared amongst our boutiques and Digital business. In Fiscal 2024, we opened our 550,000 square foot distribution centre in Vaughan, Ontario. This facility is in- sourced and replaced our previous 150,000 square foot facility operated by a third-party logistics provider in Mississauga, Ontario. We have commenced construction of an additional 200,000 square feet space in this facility which is expected to be operational in Fiscal 2026.

We plan to retain our current facility in New Westminster, British Columbia for storage and office space purposes, among other things. We plan on implementing increased automation, including robotic equipment in this new facility to increase our efficiencies and throughput. Our current facilities are set up to flexibly manage multi-channel and Omni channel demands, as our business continues to grow, and these further expansions will also support both our retail and Digital businesses with added capacity to handle higher levels of throughput. Omni-Channel Capabilities In Fiscal 2025, we successfully ramped up Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store and stabilized our Buy Online, Ship From Store capabilities. These new capabilities enabled us to maximize sales and profitability by offering customers more order options. Our Omni channel was built on the foundation of our point-of-sale system and investment in digital selling tools to enable omni-channel capabilities and optimize our technical systems and architecture. The project brought to life a new order fulfillment solution, the physical optimization of our backroom spaces, foundational order sourcing technology, and enhancements to our digital customer experience. The Omni channel capabilities are as follows: • Buy Online, Ship From Store – Available in most boutiques in Canada and the U.S., this capability introduces store inventory online, ensuring our full product assortment is available on aritzia.com. It also enables strategic targeting of inventory across our network of boutiques and minimizes delivery time to our clients. • Buy Online, Pick-up In Store – Available in most boutiques in Canada and the U.S., this capability provides clients with the option to pick up their online order in store.

We’ve also made meaningful improvements to the availability of fulfillment data and analytics as well as tools to maintain inventory accuracy and management which has resulted in improved fulfillment rates in stores. Impact and Governance Reflecting the importance of sustainability-related risks and opportunities to our business and brands, and as a prominent player in the fashion industry, Aritzia believes it has a responsibility to strengthen our efforts of delivering Everyday Luxury™ responsibly. As our business grows, so does our potential to create lasting change - we remain committed to advancing our Impact goals and measuring our year-over-year progress against published targets. At Aritzia, Impact refers to the contributions we make to People and the Planet across our full value chain - from raw material sourcing through to product end-of-life. As we continue to grow our business, we plan to increase our efforts to embed sustainability into how we operate - focusing on the areas where we can make the greatest positive impact. Across our supply chain, we are aiming to invest in preferred materials (terminology aligned to the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit setting industry standards for sustainable fibers and materials to improve clarity and comparability) and collaborating with partners to advance responsible practices. We believe these contributions matter to our clients and we seek to take an evidence-based approach and to deliver long-term positive impact for the benefit of our business resilience and our stakeholders. Our Impact priorities are guided by the findings in our materiality assessment - which identified a prioritized list of the most significant sustainability issues, risks and opportunities that are important to long-term resilience. In Fiscal 2025, we reached a significant milestone in our climate strategy by meeting our near-term goal to establish science- based emissions reduction targets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

We continued to support the communities we serve through product donations, financial support and employee volunteer hours. Additionally, we enhanced our support for employees through expanded parenthood benefits and remained committed to our belonging and inclusion initiatives. Consumer Trends The apparel industry is subject to shifts in consumer trends, preferences and consumer spending and our revenue and operating results depend, in part, on our ability to respond to such changes and in a timely manner. Our differentiated multi-brand strategy gives us control over our products and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in consumer demand and fashion preferences, which has historically been a critical driver of our growth. Our revenue is also impacted by discretionary spending by consumers, which is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, tariff and international trade policies that could put pressure on our pricing, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer debt, inflation, the cost of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather, natural disasters or global pandemics. We believe that our track record demonstrates the success of our exclusive brand strategy at responding to changes in fashion demands through all stages of economic cycles. Seasonality The apparel industry is seasonal in nature, with a higher proportion of net revenue and operating income generated in the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. We also have higher working capital requirements in the periods preceding the launch of new seasons as we receive and pay for new inventory. We manage our working capital needs through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Average quarterly share of annual net revenue over the last three completed fiscal years is as follows: First fiscal quarter 19% Second fiscal quarter 23% Third fiscal quarter 28% Fourth fiscal quarter 30% Yearly total 100% Weather Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our boutiques are located could adversely affect our business and financial results.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

This is potentially mitigated by our clients’ ability to buy our products through aritzia.com. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy to effectively present seasonal inventory. Further, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could materially impact our supply chain network. Competition We operate in the apparel industry, primarily within the Canadian and United States markets. We are strategically positioned in the global fashion landscape between fast fashion and luxury. We compete with a diverse group of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, fast fashion retailers, athletic retailers and other manufacturers and retailers of branded apparel. Market participants compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of boutiques, eCommerce experience, the breadth, style, quality, price and availability of merchandise, the level of client service and brand recognition. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of several factors that include our strategic mix of exclusive brands and iconically Aritzia products, offering of a combination of high quality products at an attainable price point, our refined and evolving merchandise planning strategy, our focus on providing an aspirational shopping experience and exceptional client service, our premier real estate portfolio, captivating content and communications, and our market positioning, collectively resulting in a fashion brand loved by our clients all over the world. Foreign Exchange Over half of our net revenue is derived in U.S. dollars and the vast majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Both our net revenues and cost of goods sold could be impacted significantly by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

See the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RETAIL INDUSTRY METRICS This MD&A makes reference to certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures (""non-IFRS financial measures"") and certain retail industry metrics. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS Accounting Standards, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS Accounting Standards measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS Accounting Standards. We use non-IFRS financial measures including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, and “Adjusted Net Income”; non-IFRS Accounting Standards ratios (""non-IFRS ratios"") including “Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share”, ""Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue"", and ""Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue""; and capital management measures including “capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives)”, and “free cash flow.” This MD&A also makes reference to “gross profit margin”, ""comparable sales"", and ""constant currency"" which are commonly used operating metrics in the retail industry but may be calculated differently by other retailers. Gross profit margin, comparable sales and constant currency are considered supplementary financial measures under applicable securities laws. These non-IFRS financial measures and retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS Accounting Standards measures.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

Our management also uses non- IFRS financial measures and retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. For definitions of these non-IFRS financial measures and retail industry metrics and reconciliations of these non-IFRS financial measures to the relevant reported measures, please see the “How We Assess the Performance of Our Business” and “Selected Financial Information” sections of this MD&A. HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net revenue reflects our sale of merchandise, less returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is delivered to the customer and therefore may be subject to deferral. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to, including variable consideration, if any, to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenues are measured net of discounts and an estimated allowance for returns. Revenues are reported net of sales taxes collected for various governmental agencies. Receipts from the sale of gift cards are treated as deferred revenue. When gift cards are redeemed for merchandise, the related revenue is recognized. Comparable sales is a retail industry metric used to explain our total combined revenue growth (decline) (in absolute dollars or percentage terms) in eCommerce and established boutiques over the comparative reportable period. Comparable sales from established boutiques is calculated based on revenue from boutiques that have been opened for at least 56 weeks, and excludes boutiques that were repositioned, boutiques in centres where we opened a new additional boutique and boutiques significantly impacted by nearby construction and other similar disruptions during this period. Our comparable sales calculation excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA-24,Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,24,14,14,"We apply the relevant prior year comparative’s average foreign currency exchange rate for the period to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison (i.e., on a constant currency basis). Constant currency change in net revenue assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. The constant currency change helps provide investors an understanding of the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit reflects our net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes inventory and product- related costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation expense for our boutiques and distribution centres. Our cost of goods sold may include different costs compared to other retailers. Gross profit margin is impacted by the components of cost of goods sold, product mix and markdowns. We define gross profit margin as our gross profit divided by our net revenue. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of selling expenses that are generally variable with net revenue and general and administrative operating expenses that are primarily fixed. Our SG&A expenses also include depreciation and amortization expenses for all support office assets and intangible assets. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue, excluding strategic investments in technology and infrastructure, are usually higher in the lower net revenue volume first and second quarters, and lower in the higher net revenue volume third and fourth quarters because a portion of these costs are relatively fixed. Our SG&A expenses may include different expenses compared to other retailers. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense. We believe this measure is useful as it is used by management as a component of reconciliation between other non-IFRS financial measures and their most comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense, adjusted for the impact of certain items, such as a deduction of interest expense and depreciation relating to our leases to reflect an estimate of rent expense and including non-cash items and/or items we consider non-recurring and not representative of our ongoing operating performance, such as stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gains or losses on equity derivative and forward contracts and other similar fair value adjustments. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by net revenue. Adjusted Net Income (and per Diluted Share) and Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses.

We define Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. We define Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted Net Income by net revenue. Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) is a measure we believe to be a useful indicator of the net cash capital investment relating to our boutiques and infrastructure. We define capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) as cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used in business combinations and other acquisitions, less proceeds from lease incentives. Free cash flow is a useful metric because it is an indicator of how much cash is available for business acquisitions, debt repayment, share repurchases and other investing and financing activities. Our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an indicator of the financial strength of our business, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain boutiques and invest in infrastructure.

We believe that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit, are expected to be sufficient to meet our future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks). Our ability to fund future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks) will depend on, among other things, our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial and other factors, including factors beyond our control. See “Summary of Factors Affecting Performance”, “Recent Events” and “Risk Factors” of this MD&A for additional information. We review investment opportunities in the normal course of our business and may make select investments to implement our business strategy when suitable opportunities arise. Historically, the funding for any such investments has come from cash flows from operating activities and/or our revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit.

Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best judgments and experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Return Allowances Recognizing provisions for sales return allowances requires the use of estimates of the return rate of merchandise based on historical return patterns. Valuation of Finished Goods Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions which requires the use of estimates related to product quality, damages, inventory shrinkage for lost or stolen items, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing requires the use of estimates in the impairment testing model. On an annual basis, we test whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired. The recoverable value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate estimates regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. We use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify our cash generating units (""CGUs"") for purposes of testing for impairment. In testing for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which involves judgment. Leases We estimate the incremental borrowing rate used for calculating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

We exercise judgment in determining the appropriate lease term at the lease commencement date. We exercise judgment on whether we will exercise available renewal or termination options, and thus include such options in the lease terms. We consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal or termination option. ACCOUNTING POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (""IFRS 9"") and IFRS Financial Instruments: Disclosures (""IFRS 7"") In May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"") issued amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures to clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of some financial assets and liabilities, with a new exception for some financial liabilities settled through an electronic cash transfer system, clarify and add further guidance for assessing whether a financial asset meets the solely payments of principal and interest (""SPPI"") criterion, add new disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change cash flows (such as instruments with features linked to the achievement of environmental and social targets), and update the disclosure of equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (""FVOCI""). These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. Early adoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt only the amendments to the classification of financial assets. The Company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure to the Financial Statements (""IFRS 18"") The IASB issued IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in the Financial Statements, in April 2024 which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027.

In addition, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks in the normal course of operations including geopolitical and macroeconomic, foreign exchange, interest rate, credit, liquidity and equity price risk, as summarized below. Our overall risk management program and business practices seek to minimize any potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial performance. Risk management is carried out under practices approved by our Audit Committee. This includes reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on the adequacy of our risk management policies and procedures with regard to identifying the Company’s principal risks and implementing appropriate systems and controls to manage these risks. Risk management covers many areas of risk including, but not limited to, geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and equity price risk. Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America and generate over half of our net revenues from the United States and so are dependent on international trade relations, agreements and regulations. On April 2, 2025, the U.S. announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from nearly all countries with higher country-specific tariff rates beginning April 9, 2025 although the effective date was delayed to allow for negotiations. The U.S. has completed negotiations with certain countries, including Vietnam, resulting in tariff rates higher than the 10% baseline rate. The U.S. tariff and customs policies continue to change and trade negotiations between the U.S. and other countries are ongoing. The U.S. also announced the One Big Beautiful Act on July 4, 2025, which removed the de minimis exemption for low value shipments imported into the United States in 2027. However, the U.S. president signed an executive order on July 30, 2025 removing the de minimis exemption for all countries beginning on August 29, 2025.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

General economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other parts of the world, including lower levels of consumer spending, economic volatility, and international trade policies and tariffs, can affect consumer confidence and consumer purchases of discretionary items, including fashion apparel and related products such as ours. Therefore, demand for our products may be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, which could worsen as a result of the imposition of new duties, tariffs and other trade restrictions or other similar measures. sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the evolving macroeconomic conditions and to adapt as needed while focusing on our strategic growth levers: geographic expansion, digital growth and increased brand awareness. Foreign Exchange Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America with the vast majority of purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. This risk is partially mitigated with over half of our net revenues generated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign exchange risk is primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar but we have limited exposure to other currencies as well. We may use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada. As at August 31, 2025, we have no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding and none were utilized during the 26-week period ended August 31, 2025. Interest Rate Risk We have a revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit which provides available borrowings in an amount up to $300.0 million and US$10 million, respectively. Because the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding balances.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q2-2026-MDA.pdf

Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the possibility of an unexpected event if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivative contracts used to hedge market risks. We are exposed to minimal credit risk. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions that have been assigned high credit ratings by internationally recognized credit rating agencies. We are exposed to credit risk on receivables from our landlords in relation to tenant improvement allowances. To reduce this risk, we enter into leases with landlords with established credit history, and for certain leases, we may offset rent payments until accounts receivable are fully satisfied. We only enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions, as described above and as needed, for the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we cannot meet a demand for cash or fund our obligations as they come due. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account the seasonality of our revenue, income, working capital and capital expenditure needs. The revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit are used to maintain liquidity. As at August 31, 2025, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to risk arising from the settlement of our cash-settled deferred and restricted share units and open market-settled RSUs and PSUs, if applicable, as an appreciating subordinate voting share price increases the potential value of the settlement. We record a liability for the potential future settlement of our cash-settled deferred and restricted share units by reference to the fair value of the liability. We may use equity derivative contracts to offset the variability of our share prices associated with the settlement of our cash-settled deferred and restricted share units and open market-settled RSUs and PSUs.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures over the public disclosure of financial and non-financial information regarding the Company. Such controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, so that they can make appropriate and timely decisions regarding public disclosure. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial reports for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting include, but are not limited to, detailed policies and procedures relating to financial accounting and reporting, and controls over systems that process and summarize transactions. The Company’s procedures for financial reporting also include the active involvement of qualified financial professionals, senior management and its Audit Committee. In designing such controls, it should be recognized that due to inherent limitations, any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, management is required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Therefore, even when determined to be designed effectively, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

These factors are also subject to a number of inherent risks and challenges, some of which are discussed below. See also the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A, and in our AIF. Our Brand and Products Our exclusive mix of fashion brands offer a strategic and thoughtfully conceived, designed, and developed collection of products. In addition to our exclusive fashion brands, we also position product under the Aritzia brand. Aritzia-branded products are beloved styles and fabrics that — of everything we make — are the most iconically Aritzia. We believe that a key area of differentiation for us is that we design apparel and accessories to enable us to reach many different groups of clients. Our sourcing and manufacturing strategy gives us control over our supply chain and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in client demand and fashion preferences. This has been critical to our ability to grow while also reducing risk.

We strive to maintain a flexible mix of historically successful items and new seasonal styles. Our changing product mix is a blended reflection of client demands and fashion direction. This strategic mix helps us to drive client conversion by delivering fashion must- haves, while still generating a meaningful proportion of revenue from our fashion essentials. We complement our exclusive product mix with a strategically chosen selection of premium denim, accessories and footwear from leading contemporary, third-party brands. Our expansive and diverse range of fashion apparel and accessories addresses a broad range of style preferences and lifestyle requirements for our clients, producing strong and enduring client loyalty.

We partner with high quality mills and suppliers to create and sample garments, which are fit-tested before production. We strive to ensure that the quality of our raw materials and the finished product are all held to our Everyday Luxury standards and the expectations of our clients. Merchandise Planning Our demand-driven merchandise planning, buying and inventory strategies have been developed and refined for over 40 years. We generate a meaningful proportion of revenue from our client favourites while helping to drive excitement through new seasonal product assortment. We analyze sales data in order to make inventory adjustments and to respond to the latest trends. Our inventory management processes and systems provide us with the ability to optimize inventory across geographies and channels to help ensure that each boutique and aritzia.com is merchandised with products that resonate with local preferences. We actively monitor sell-through rates and manage the mix of product categories in our boutiques and aritzia.com. We endeavour to respond to emerging trends in a timely manner, minimize our dependence on any particular category, style or fabrication and preserve a balanced, coordinated presentation of merchandise within each boutique while striving to offer our client the entire assortment online.

Sourcing and Production We contract and maintain direct relationships with a diversified base of independent suppliers and manufacturers for our exclusive brands who provide us with the flexibility to source high quality materials and products at competitive costs. We believe that our approach of sourcing a majority of our raw materials and working directly with suppliers and manufacturers enhances our ability to create beautiful and high-quality products in a timely manner.

We continue to monitor and diversify our supplier base, taking into consideration the geopolitical, economic, regulatory, tariff, trade and tax environment to mitigate risk. Capacity planning with our manufacturers is done at the beginning of the season to help ensure flexibility. We engage third parties to inspect our manufacturers’ factories to help ensure quality control and engage independent expert service providers to conduct factory audits for compliance with local laws and regulations and global standards. We have launched a vendor self-certification process for quality assurance and inspection. We believe this will help ensure a greater execution of our quality expectations and to allow for vendors to reduce cycle time. We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct and initiatives to increase transparency with respect to the origins of our raw materials. Boutiques We have developed our boutique network in a measured and disciplined manner. We have a portfolio of boutiques situated in premier real estate locations in high performing retail malls and high streets in Canada and the United States. Our strong boutique sales productivity continues to make us a sought-after tenant for top quality locations in premier shopping destinations. In addition to opening new boutiques, we generate attractive returns on capital by enhancing elements of our existing boutiques (including footprint, layout and assortment) through carefully considered boutique repositions.

Distribution Facilities Our current distribution network consists of three distribution centres, two in Canada and one in the United States, that are well positioned to service our boutiques and eCommerce business. Our distribution centres include a 223,000 square foot facility in New Westminster, British Columbia, our most recently opened 550,000 square foot facility in Vaughan, Ontario, and a 560,000 square foot third-party facility in Columbus, Ohio. We operate our distribution centres located in New Westminster, British Columbia and Vaughan, Ontario, while the distribution centre located in Columbus, Ohio is operated by a third-party logistics provider. Our inventory is centrally managed and shared amongst our boutiques and eCommerce business. In Fiscal 2024, we opened our 550,000 square foot distribution centre in Vaughan, Ontario. This new facility is in- sourced and replaces our previous 150,000 square foot facility operated by a third-party logistics provider in Mississauga, Ontario. In Fiscal 2024, preparation activities and initial shell-building construction commenced on a new 380,000 square foot facility in Delta, British Columbia. When completed, this new facility will be operated by us and is expected to be operational in late Fiscal 2026. We plan to retain our current facility in New Westminster, British Columbia for storage and office space purposes, among other things. We plan on implementing increased automation, including robotic equipment in this new facility to increase our efficiencies and throughput. In Fiscal 2024, we expanded and took over the entire building in our Columbus, Ohio distribution centre, resulting in an additional 305,000 square feet for a total of approximately 560,000 square feet in that facility. We began retrofitting work in this facility in Fiscal 2025 to help optimize our operations.

These new capabilities will help maximize sales and profitability and ensure our store teams are operating efficiently. The Omni Project is built on the foundation of our point-of-sale system and investment in digital selling tools to enable omni-channel capabilities and optimize our technical systems and architecture. The project brought to life a new order fulfillment solution, the physical optimization of our backroom spaces, foundational order sourcing technology, and enhancements to our digital customer experience. The omni channel capabilities are as follows: • Buy Online, Ship From Store – Available in most of our boutiques, this capability introduces store inventory online, ensuring our full product assortment is available on aritzia.com. It also enables strategic targeting of inventory across our network of boutiques and minimizes delivery time to our clients. • Buy Online, Pick-up In Store – Available in most of our boutiques, this capability provides clients with the option to pick up their online order in store. Building on store inventory visibility, this capability further integrates the online and in-store experiences leveraging the strong service in our boutiques to deliver an elevated, yet convenient experience.

At Aritzia, Community refers to the contributions we make to People and the Planet. The Community scope spans Aritzia’s full value chain — from raw material sourcing in our upstream operations, through to product end-of-life in our downstream operations. With the goal to strengthen our positive impact, initiatives and oversight are shared throughout our organization. We seek to take an evidence-based approach and to deliver long-term impact. Our priorities are aligned with the findings in our materiality assessment — which identifies our material impacts, opportunities and risks, as well as The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) reporting framework, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), and the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In Fiscal 2024, we began building on our climate change-related reporting infrastructure in preparation to meet the then anticipated reporting standards of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB)’s Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards (CSDS), as they may be adopted and/or modified by Canadian securities or other regulators. These standards align with the global baseline standards developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

Our differentiated multi-brand strategy gives us control over our products and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in consumer demand and fashion preferences, which has historically been a critical driver of our growth. Our revenue is also impacted by discretionary spending by consumers, which is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer debt, inflation, the cost of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather, natural disasters or global pandemics.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf

Seasonality The apparel industry is seasonal in nature, with a higher proportion of net revenue and operating income generated in the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. We also have higher working capital requirements in the periods preceding the launch of new seasons as we receive and pay for new inventory. We manage our working capital needs through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Average quarterly share of annual net revenue over the last three completed fiscal years is as follows: First fiscal quarter 18% Second fiscal quarter 24% Third fiscal quarter 29% Fourth fiscal quarter 29% Yearly total 100% Weather Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our boutiques are located could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our clients to travel to our boutiques and thereby reduce our revenue and profitability. This is potentially mitigated by our clients’ ability to buy our products through aritzia.com. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy to effectively present seasonal inventory. Competition We operate in the apparel industry, primarily within the Canadian and United States markets. We are strategically positioned in the global fashion landscape between fast fashion and luxury. We compete with a diverse group of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, fast fashion retailers, athletic retailers and other manufacturers and retailers of branded apparel. Market participants compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of boutiques, eCommerce experience, the breadth, style, quality, price and availability of merchandise, the level of client service and brand recognition.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf

Foreign Exchange Over half of our net revenue is derived in U.S. dollars while the vast majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our cost of goods sold could therefore be impacted by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar could materially affect our gross profit margins and operating results. If needed, we will use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada, but there can be no assurances that such strategies will prove to be successful.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf

Gross profit margin and comparable sales are considered supplementary financial measures under applicable securities laws. These non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. For definitions of these non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics and reconciliations of these non-IFRS financial measures to the relevant reported measures, please see the “How We Assess the Performance of Our Business” and “Selected Financial Information” sections of this MD&A. HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net revenue reflects our sale of merchandise, less returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is delivered to the customer and therefore may be subject to deferral.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA-21,Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,21,14,14,"Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to, including variable consideration, if any, to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenues are measured net of discounts and an estimated allowance for returns. Revenues are reported net of sales taxes collected for various governmental agencies. Receipts from the sale of gift cards are treated as deferred revenue. When gift cards are redeemed for merchandise, the related revenue is recognized. Comparable sales is a retail industry metric used to explain our total combined revenue growth (decline) (in absolute dollars or percentage terms) in eCommerce and established boutiques over the comparative reportable period. Comparable sales from established boutiques is calculated based on revenue from boutiques that have been opened for at least 56 weeks, and excludes boutiques that were repositioned, boutiques in centres where we opened a new additional boutique and boutiques significantly impacted by nearby construction and other similar disruptions during this period. Our comparable sales calculation excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We apply the relevant prior year comparative’s average monthly exchange rate to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison (i.e., on a constant currency basis). Gross profit reflects our net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes inventory and product- related costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation expense for our boutiques and distribution centres. Our cost of goods sold may include different costs compared to other retailers. Gross profit margin is impacted by the components of cost of goods sold, product mix and markdowns. We define gross profit margin as our gross profit divided by our net revenue. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of selling expenses that are generally variable with net revenue and general and administrative operating expenses that are primarily fixed. Our SG&A expenses also include depreciation and amortization expenses for all support office assets and intangible assets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf

Our SG&A expenses may include different expenses compared to other retailers. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense. We believe this measure is useful as it is used by management as a component of reconciliation between other non-IFRS measures and their most comparable IFRS measure. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of operating performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of operating results in that the measures exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by removing the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense, adjusted for the impact of certain items, such as a deduction of interest expense and depreciation relating to our leases to reflect an estimate of rent expense and including non-cash items and/or items we consider non-recurring and not representative of our ongoing operating performance, such as stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gains or losses on equity derivative and forward contracts and fair value adjustments on NCI in exchangeable shares liability. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges.

We define Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. We define Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted Net Income by net revenue. Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) is a measure we believe to be a useful indicator of the net cash capital investment relating to our boutiques and infrastructure. We define capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) as cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used in business combinations and other acquisitions, less proceeds from lease incentives. Free cash flow is a useful metric because it is an indicator of how much cash is available for business acquisitions, debt repayment, share repurchases and other investing and financing activities. Our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an indicator of the financial strength of our business, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain boutiques and invest in infrastructure.

Our ability to fund future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks) will depend on, among other things, our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial and other factors, including factors beyond our control.

We review investment opportunities in the normal course of our business and may make select investments to implement our business strategy when suitable opportunities arise.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best judgments and experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Return Allowances Recognizing provisions for sales return allowances requires the use of estimates of the return rate of merchandise based on historical return patterns. Valuation of Finished Goods Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions which requires the use of estimates related to product quality, damages, inventory shrinkage for lost or stolen items, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing requires the use of estimates in the impairment testing model. On an annual basis, we test whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired. The recoverable value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate estimates regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. We use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify our cash generating units (""CGUs"") for purposes of testing for impairment. In testing for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which involves judgment. Leases We estimate the incremental borrowing rate used for calculating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA-43,Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,43,25,26,"We estimate the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset as the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. We exercise judgment in determining the appropriate lease term at the lease commencement date. We exercise judgment on whether we will exercise available renewal or termination options, and thus include such options in the lease terms. We consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal or termination option. ACCOUNTING POLICY DEVELOPMENTS Several amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards apply for the first time in 2024 but do not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company (see discussion in the Company's Fiscal 2024 MD&A). The International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in the Financial Statements in April 2024, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027. The new standard introduces newly defined subtotals on the income statement, requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of information, and disclosure of Management Performance Measures (MPMs) in the financial statements. Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 18 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks in the normal course of operations including foreign exchange, interest rate, credit, liquidity and equity price risk, as summarized below. Our overall risk management program and business practices seek to minimize any potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial performance. Risk management is carried out under practices approved by our Audit Committee. This includes reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on the adequacy of our risk management policies and procedures with regard to identifying the Company’s principal risks and implementing appropriate systems and controls to manage these risks. Risk management covers many areas of risk including, but not limited to, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and equity price risk.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA-44,Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,44,26,26,"Foreign Exchange Risk We source the majority of our raw materials and merchandise from various suppliers in Asia, Europe and Central America with the vast majority of purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign exchange risk is primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar but we have limited exposure to other currencies as well. We may use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with forecasted U.S. dollar merchandise purchases sold in Canada. As at December 1, 2024, we have no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding and none were utilized during the 39-week period ended December 1, 2024. Interest Rate Risk We have a revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit which provides available borrowings in an amount up to $300.0 million and US$10 million, respectively. Because the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding balances. As at December 1, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and the revolving line of credit. Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the possibility of an unexpected event if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivative contracts used to hedge market risks. We are exposed to minimal credit risk. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions that have been assigned high credit ratings by internationally recognized credit rating agencies. We are exposed to credit risk on receivables from our landlords in relation to tenant improvement allowances. To reduce this risk, we enter into leases with landlords with established credit history, and for certain leases, we may offset rent payments until accounts receivable are fully satisfied. We only enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions, as described above and as needed, for the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we cannot meet a demand for cash or fund our obligations as they come due.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA-45,Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,45,26,27,"We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account the seasonality of our revenue, income, working capital and capital expenditure needs. The revolving credit facility and related revolving line of credit are used to maintain liquidity. As at December 1, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to risk arising from the cash settlement of our deferred and restricted share units, as an appreciating subordinate voting share price increases the potential cash outflow. We record a liability for the potential future settlement of our deferred and restricted share units by reference to the fair value of the liability. We may use equity derivative contracts to offset our cash flow variability of the expected payment associated with our deferred and restricted share units. We only enter into equity derivative contracts with major financial institutions. As at December 1, 2024, the fair value of the equity derivative contract was in an asset position of $10.4 million. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures over the public disclosure of financial and non-financial information regarding the Company. Such controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, so that they can make appropriate and timely decisions regarding public disclosure. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial reports for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting include, but are not limited to, detailed policies and procedures relating to financial accounting and reporting, and controls over systems that process and summarize transactions. The Company’s procedures for financial reporting also include the active involvement of qualified financial professionals, senior management and its Audit Committee. In designing such controls, it should be recognized that due to inherent limitations, any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q3-2025-MDA.pdf

These factors are also subject to a number of inherent risks and challenges, some of which are discussed below. See also the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A, and in our AIF. Our Brand and Products Our exclusive mix of fashion brands offer a strategic and thoughtfully conceived, designed, and developed collection of products. In addition to our exclusive fashion brands, we also position product under the Aritzia brand. Aritzia-branded products are beloved fabrics and styles that — of everything we make — are the most iconically Aritzia. We believe that a key area of differentiation for us is that we design apparel and accessories to enable us to reach many different groups of clients. Our sourcing and manufacturing strategy gives us control over our supply chain and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in client demand and fashion preferences. This has been critical to our ability to grow while also reducing risk. Comparable sales in each respective period reflects total combined net revenue from eCommerce and established boutiques that fall within the comparable sales base during the respective period.

We strive to ensure that the quality of our raw materials and the finished product are all held to our Everyday Luxury™ standards and the expectations of our clients. Merchandise Planning Our demand-driven merchandise planning, buying and inventory strategies have been developed and evolved for over 40 years. We generate a meaningful proportion of revenue from our client favourites while helping to drive excitement through new seasonal product assortment. We analyze sales data in order to make inventory adjustments and to respond to the latest trends. Our inventory management processes and systems provide us with the ability to optimize inventory across geographies and channels to ensure that each boutique and aritzia.com is merchandised with products that resonate with local preferences. We actively monitor sell-through rates and manage the mix of product categories in our boutiques and aritzia.com. We respond to emerging trends in a timely manner, minimize our dependence on any particular category, style or fabrication and preserve a balanced, coordinated presentation of merchandise within each boutique while offering our client the entire assortment online. We believe that our disciplined merchandise planning strategy enables us to optimize inventory levels and maximize full-price sales. Sourcing and Production We contract and maintain direct relationships with a diversified base of independent suppliers and manufacturers for our exclusive brands who provide us with the flexibility to source high quality materials and products at competitive costs. We believe that our approach of sourcing a majority of our raw materials and working directly with suppliers and manufacturers enhances our ability to create beautiful and high-quality products in a timely manner. We source the majority of our raw materials directly from mills, trim suppliers and manufacturers in overseas markets, which we believe to be best in class, located primarily in China, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that uphold our standards for quality, lead time and cost.

We leverage our “Next Generation Supplier” relationships by using their multi origin footprint to pivot as geopolitical obstacles arise without interrupting our product lifecycle. Capacity planning with our manufacturers is done at the beginning of the season to help ensure flexibility. We engage third parties to inspect our manufacturers’ factories to help maintain quality control and engage independent expert service providers to conduct factory audits for compliance with local laws and regulations and global standards. We have launched a vendor self-certification process for quality assurance and inspection. We believe this will help ensure a greater execution of our quality expectations and to allow for vendors to reduce cycle time. We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct and initiatives to increase transparency with respect to the origins of our raw materials. Boutiques We have developed our boutique network in a measured and disciplined manner. We have a portfolio of boutiques situated in premier real estate locations in high performing retail malls and high streets in Canada and the United States. Our strong boutique sales productivity continues to make us a sought-after tenant for top quality locations in premier shopping destinations. In addition to opening new boutiques, we generate attractive returns on capital by enhancing elements of our existing boutiques (including footprint, layout and assortment) through carefully considered boutique repositions, relocations and expansions.

Aritzia is focused on improving the Digital experience across all devices (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet) to work towards making shopping even more frictionless than it is today. The core areas of our client’s digital journey including discovery, evaluating, and purchase are continuously improved. Distribution Facilities Our current distribution network consists of three distribution centres, two in Canada and one in the United States, that are well positioned to service our boutiques and Digital business. Our distribution centres include a 223,000 square foot facility in New Westminster, British Columbia, a newly-opened 550,000 square foot facility in Vaughan, Ontario, and a 560,000 square foot third-party facility in Columbus, Ohio. We operate our distribution centres located in New Westminster, British Columbia and Vaughan, Ontario, while the distribution centre located in Columbus, Ohio is operated by a third-party logistics provider. Our inventory is centrally managed and shared amongst our boutiques and Digital business. In Fiscal 2024, we opened our new 550,000 square foot distribution centre in Vaughan, Ontario. This new facility is in-sourced and replaces our previous 150,000 square foot facility operated by a third-party logistics provider in Mississauga, Ontario. We have commenced construction of an additional 200,000 square feet space in this facility which is expected to be operational in Fiscal 2026.

We started finalizing plans for construction and design along with starting some construction activities at the end of Fiscal 2025. When completed, this new facility will be operated by us and is expected to be operational in early Fiscal 2027. We plan to retain our current facility in New Westminster, British Columbia for storage and office space purposes, among other things. We plan on implementing increased automation, including robotic equipment in this new facility to increase our efficiencies and throughput. Our current facilities are set up to flexibly manage multi-channel and Omni channel demands, as our business continues to grow, and these further expansions will also support both our retail and Digital businesses with added capacity to handle higher levels of throughput. Omni-Channel Capabilities In Fiscal 2025, we successfully ramped up Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store and stabilized our Buy Online, Ship From Store capabilities. These new capabilities enabled us to maximize sales and profitability by offering customers more order options. Our Omni channel was built on the foundation of our point-of-sale system and investment in digital selling tools to enable omni-channel capabilities and optimize our technical systems and architecture.

Consumer Trends The apparel industry is subject to shifts in consumer trends, preferences and consumer spending and our revenue and operating results depend, in part, on our ability to respond to such changes and in a timely manner. Our differentiated multi-brand strategy gives us control over our products and provides us with the flexibility to optimize our brand mix as needed to address changes in consumer demand and fashion preferences, which has historically been a critical driver of our growth. Our revenue is also impacted by discretionary spending by consumers, which is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, tariff and international trade policies that could put pressure on our pricing, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer debt, inflation, the cost of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather, natural disasters or global pandemics. We believe that our track record demonstrates the success of our exclusive brand strategy at responding to changes in fashion demands through all stages of economic cycles. Seasonality The apparel industry is seasonal in nature, with a higher proportion of net revenue and operating income generated in the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. We also have higher working capital requirements in the periods preceding the launch of new seasons as we receive and pay for new inventory. We manage our working capital needs through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Average quarterly share of annual net revenue over the last three completed fiscal years is as follows: First fiscal quarter 19% Second fiscal quarter 23% Third fiscal quarter 28% Fourth fiscal quarter 30% Yearly total 100% Weather Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our boutiques are located could adversely affect our business and financial results.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf

This is potentially mitigated by our clients’ ability to buy our products through aritzia.com. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy to effectively present seasonal inventory. Further, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could materially impact our supply chain network. Competition We operate in the apparel industry, primarily within the Canadian and United States markets. We are strategically positioned in the global fashion landscape between fast fashion and luxury. We compete with a diverse group of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, fast fashion retailers, athletic retailers and other manufacturers and retailers of branded apparel. Market participants compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of boutiques, eCommerce experience, the breadth, style, quality, price and availability of merchandise, the level of client service and brand recognition. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of several factors that include our strategic mix of exclusive brands and iconically Aritzia products, offering of a combination of high quality products at an attainable price point, our refined and evolving merchandise planning strategy, our focus on providing an aspirational shopping experience and exceptional client service, our premier real estate portfolio, captivating content and communications, and our market positioning, collectively resulting in a fashion brand loved by our clients all over the world. Foreign Exchange Over half of our net revenue is derived in U.S. dollars and the vast majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Both our net revenues and cost of goods sold could be impacted significantly by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf

See the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A. NON-IFRS MEASURES AND RETAIL INDUSTRY METRICS This MD&A makes reference to certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures (""non-IFRS measures"") and certain retail industry metrics. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS Accounting Standards, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS Accounting Standards measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS Accounting Standards. We use non-IFRS financial measures including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, and “Adjusted Net Income”; non-IFRS Accounting Standards ratios (""non-IFRS ratios"") including “Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share”, ""Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue"", and ""Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue""; and capital management measures including “capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives)”, and “free cash flow.” This MD&A also makes reference to “gross profit margin”, ""comparable sales"", and ""constant currency"" which are commonly used operating metrics in the retail industry but may be calculated differently by other retailers. Gross profit margin, comparable sales and constant currency are considered supplementary financial measures under applicable securities laws. These non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS Accounting Standards measures.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA-23,Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,23,15,15,"We believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. For definitions of these non-IFRS measures and retail industry metrics and reconciliations of these non-IFRS measures to the relevant reported measures, please see the “How We Assess the Performance of Our Business” and “Selected Financial Information” sections of this MD&A. HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net revenue reflects our sale of merchandise, less returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is delivered to the customer and therefore may be subject to deferral. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to, including variable consideration, if any, to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenues are measured net of discounts and an estimated allowance for returns. Revenues are reported net of sales taxes collected for various governmental agencies. Receipts from the sale of gift cards are treated as deferred revenue. When gift cards are redeemed for merchandise, the related revenue is recognized. Comparable sales is a retail industry metric used to explain our total combined revenue growth (decline) (in absolute dollars or percentage terms) in eCommerce and established boutiques over the comparative reportable period. Comparable sales from established boutiques is calculated based on revenue from boutiques that have been opened for at least 56 weeks, and excludes boutiques that were repositioned, boutiques in centres where we opened a new additional boutique and boutiques significantly impacted by nearby construction and other similar disruptions during this period. Our comparable sales calculation excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA-24,Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,24,15,15,"We apply the relevant prior year comparative’s average foreign currency exchange rate for the period to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison (i.e., on a constant currency basis). Constant currency change in net revenue assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. The constant currency change helps provide investors an understanding of the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit reflects our net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes inventory and product- related costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation expense for our boutiques and distribution centres. Our cost of goods sold may include different costs compared to other retailers. Gross profit margin is impacted by the components of cost of goods sold, product mix and markdowns. We define gross profit margin as our gross profit divided by our net revenue. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of selling expenses that are generally variable with net revenue and general and administrative operating expenses that are primarily fixed. Our SG&A expenses also include depreciation and amortization expenses for all support office assets and intangible assets. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue, excluding strategic investments in technology and infrastructure, are usually higher in the lower net revenue volume first and second quarters, and lower in the higher net revenue volume third and fourth quarters because a portion of these costs are relatively fixed. Our SG&A expenses may include different expenses compared to other retailers. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense. We believe this measure is useful as it is used by management as a component of reconciliation between other non-IFRS measures and their most comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf
Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA-25,Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA,ATZ,,,mda_canada,md&a,,md&a,,25,16,16,"Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of operating performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of operating results in that the measures exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by removing the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, finance expense and income tax expense, adjusted for the impact of certain items, such as a deduction of interest expense and depreciation relating to our leases to reflect an estimate of rent expense and including non-cash items and/or items we consider non-recurring and not representative of our ongoing operating performance, such as stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gains or losses on equity derivative and forward contracts and other similar fair value adjustments. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by net revenue. Adjusted Net Income (and per Diluted Share) and Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue are useful measures of performance, as we believe they provide a more relevant picture of results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We use Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share, and Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue to facilitate a comparison of our performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf

We define Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. We define Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of net revenue as the percentage obtained by dividing Adjusted Net Income by net revenue. Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) is a measure we believe to be a useful indicator of the net cash capital investment relating to our boutiques and infrastructure. We define capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives) as cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used in business combinations and other acquisitions, less proceeds from lease incentives. Free cash flow is a useful metric because it is an indicator of how much cash is available for business acquisitions, debt repayment, share repurchases and other investing and financing activities. Our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an indicator of the financial strength of our business, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain boutiques and invest in infrastructure. We define free cash flow as net cash generated from operating activities excluding interest paid on credit facilities, less repayments of principal on lease liabilities and capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives).",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf

We believe that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit, are expected to be sufficient to meet our future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks). Our ability to fund future operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and return to shareholders (share buybacks) will depend on, among other things, our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial and other factors, including factors beyond our control. See “Summary of Factors Affecting Performance”, “Recent Events” and “Risk Factors” of this MD&A for additional information. We review investment opportunities in the normal course of our business and may make select investments to implement our business strategy when suitable opportunities arise. Historically, the funding for any such investments has come from cash flows from operating activities and/or our revolving credit facility and revolving line of credit. Revolving Credit Facility and Revolving Line of Credit As at March 2, 2025, we have a $300.0 million revolving credit facility and a US$10.0 million revolving line of credit issued by a member of the lending syndicate in connection with the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest at Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (""CORRA""), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") or Canadian prime or base rate, plus a marginal rate between 0.75% and 2.75% (March 3, 2024 – 0.75% and 2.75%). The revolving line of credit bears interest at the daily SOFR, plus a marginal rate between 1.75% and 2.75% (March 3, 2024 – 1.75% and 2.75%). The revolving credit facility matures on October 27, 2026.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best judgments and experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Return Allowances Recognizing provisions for sales return allowances requires the use of estimates of the return rate of merchandise based on historical return patterns. Valuation of Finished Goods Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions which requires the use of estimates related to product quality, damages, inventory shrinkage for lost or stolen items, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf

On an annual basis, we test whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired. The recoverable value is determined using discounted future cash flow models, which incorporate estimates regarding future events, specifically future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. We use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify our cash generating units (""CGUs"") for purposes of testing for impairment. In testing for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, which involves judgment. Leases We estimate the incremental borrowing rate used for calculating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset as the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. We exercise judgment in determining the appropriate lease term at the lease commencement date. We exercise judgment on whether we will exercise available renewal or termination options, and thus include such options in the lease terms. We consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal or termination option. ACCOUNTING POLICY DEVELOPMENTS International Accounting Standards (""IAS"") 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"") issued amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements to clarify the criteria for classifying liabilities with covenants as current or non-current. The amendments also require companies to provide additional note disclosure on non-current liabilities with covenants. The amendments also indicate the classification of a liability between current and noncurrent includes the determination of whether a substantive right to defer settlement for at least 12 months exists and is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\atz_q_mda\Aritzia-Inc-Q4-2025-MDA.pdf

General economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other parts of the world, including lower levels of consumer spending, economic volatility, and international trade policies and tariffs, can affect consumer confidence and consumer purchases of discretionary items, including fashion apparel and related products such as ours. Therefore, demand for our products may be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, which could worsen as a result of the imposition of new duties, tariffs and other trade restrictions or other similar measures. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We deposit our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions that have been assigned high credit ratings by internationally recognized credit rating agencies. We are exposed to credit risk on receivables from our landlords in relation to tenant improvement allowances. To reduce this risk, we enter into leases with landlords with established credit history, and for certain leases, we may offset rent payments until accounts receivable are fully satisfied. We only enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions, as described above and as needed, for the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we cannot meet a demand for cash or fund our obligations as they come due. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account the seasonality of our revenue, income, working capital and capital expenditure needs.
