As recent boutique openings exceed hurdle rates and new e-commerce marketing takes hold, sales and margin expansion may top expectations. The company's model of selling mostly at full price -- we estimate that it makes up 80% of sales -- distinguishes Aritzia in a US market loaded with promotions. Only Lululemon takes a similar tack, which is likely a big factor in its 27% Ebitda margin. Aritzia's 2027 target for a 19% Ebitda margin can be exceeded by 100-200 bps as the company begins to market online, since the fast growing US e-commerce business is more profitable than in-store.

Its model of selling mostly at full price, which we calculate as making up 80% of sales, distinguishes Aritzia in a US market flush with promotions. Only Lululemon takes a similar tack, likely a big factor in its 27% Ebitda margin. Aritzia may surpass its 19% Ebitda margin target for 2027 by 100-200 bps as it boosts online marketing, with the fast-growing US e-commerce business more profitable than in-store.

COVID Omitted Source: FactSet, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Digging further, we went back 25–30 years within our retail universe and looked for periods where companies grew at outsized rates (revenue growth > +10-15% with positive comps) and looked at P/E multiples during both the acceleration and deceleration periods of their growth. We found a total of 15 companies that fit our growth parameters and organized their periods of outsized growth with corresponding valuation rates by 4 groupings of time periods from 1996 to today, seen in the exhibit below. Given ATZ's multiple expansion off of its recent accelerated growth this FY and the contraction we have historically seen in the sector when said growth slows, we analyzed these names within our retail universe to determine what the downside risk could be if ATZ's growth significantly decelerated by comparing the front end valuations of their expansion period (the period of top-line growth acceleration) vs. the back end (the period of top-line deceleration). For both the front and back end, in our exhibit below we present the minimum, maximum and median P/Es during each name's respective period.

We likewise heard some concerning details on LULU's China direction from our latest China Sportswear Expert Call (\"State of Retail\" Expert Series: James Wong, China Sportswear and Footwear Operator). If LULU's high margin China region shows any material holes, it would clearly drive greater margin risk go-fwd (highest segment GMs and incremental margins). From a top-down perspective, general trends in China sportswear/athletics appears more mixed of late (ex 2) and overall consumer commentary is negative. News reports suggest the PBOC survey of consumer sentiment worsened further in the April - June 2Q survey with respondents \"increasingly negative about income, employment and price...\" Views on the jobs market fell to the worst reading ever and reports argue that recent sales growth in China was based on government subsidies, not improving consumer sentiment. Concerns on discretionary income and price are potentially significant given recent checks. Feedback from our recent expert checks shared similar concerns that LULU's growth, specifically, could slow from the move to Tier 2 cities given premium product and elevated pricing.

Tariffs were the key driver to the downside, causing the majority of the ~50bp revision to GM/OM. Post 1Q, the Trump administration announced an agreement with Vietnam on finalized trade and tariff details. The trade deal includes a 20% US tariff on Vietnamese goods, as well as a 40% “transshipping” tariff. We acknowledge that questions remain, including when the deal would take effect and whether the agreement is signed—Vietnam Briefing said in a 7/7 article that the two sides \"have agreed in principle to a framework trade deal.\" Another point of uncertainty is the issue of transshipment volumes and values given the 2x unmitigated rate (40% vs. 20%) vs. direct imports from Vietnam.

For example, a score of 85 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for 85% of the quarter, whereas a score of 15 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for only 15% of the quarter.

For example, a score of 85 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for 85% of the quarter, whereas a score of 15 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for only 15% of the quarter. As a reminder, scores of 0 to 33 are considered “Deeper”; 34 to 67 are considered “Flat”; and 67 to 100 are considered “Better” YoY. We use this analysis as a proxy for the direction of merchandise margin. FIGURE 64.

Ending the De Minimis Exemption - 2025 Timeline of Events • April 2, 2025: As part of tariffs announced on \"Liberation Day,\" President Trump signed an executive order closing the exemption for shipments from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, 2025. • July 4, 2025: President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which legally repealed the exemption altogether—set to take effect on July 1, 2027. • July 30, 2025: Using emergency executive powers, President Trump accelerated the end of the exemption for all countries, bringing it forward to August 29, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT. • For China and Hong Kong specifically, it had already ended earlier on May 2, 2025. The Abrupt Shift In Policy Makes the Issue More Topical The timing of the announcements is the key factor here.

To start—we acknowledge a lot of \"known unknowns\" as it relates to LULU's de minimis usage. That said, as we have dug around our space looking to see if any other companies have benefited from DM over the past several years without investors knowing, we believe LULU falls in the same bucket that TPR does. To that point, we recently spoke with a few industry contacts/former employees to better understand the issue. While we didn't get a direct read on LULU's absolute de minimis exposure (not clear how much US ecomm it captures), our checks did confirm that LULU utilizes the exception. One important point is that LULU was already heavily leveraged to Canadian distribution given their heritage, potentially exacerbating the issue of de minimis exposure (much easier for them to lean into the loophole vs. others). Of note, approximately 1/3 of LULU's NA DC square footage is located in Canada. While we don't have exact numbers, one contact did state they believe LULU's DM exposure is likely outsized vs. others given the Canada DC network.

Floor & Decor has also diversified away from China, with 18% of products sold coming from the country vs. 50% in 2018. It plans to reduce this to mid- to low single digits by year-end.

Toymakers Hasbro and Mattel, which continue to cut exposure to China, are better positioned but will also face margin pressure in 2H through 2026. That's even with higher prices and shifts in production or sourcing. Exposure to other countries is mostly lower across our coverage. Retailers like Best Buy have less direct control than manufacturers over inventory sourced from China or other countries. Still, tariffs and resulting price hikes will be a headwind for profit in 2H and in 2026, even as indirect exposure to China has dropped to 30-35%.

Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing.

Puig faces a larger mismatch, given its greater mix of high-end fragrances imported from Europe, but has stronger pricing power vs. most other categories.

The analysts’ assessment of these and other factors may produce an Analyst Risk Profile that may differ from the Quantitative Risk Profile. Increased competition and consumer’s trading down to lower priced products is a key risk factor that could impact the LULU’s overall market share. Moreover, rising input costs, inflated labor expenses, and growing property costs add to the company's risk factors. Changes in management could also impact the company's performance significantly.

Risks to Rating and Price Target While LULU has a substantial sq. ft. growth opportunity both domestically and internationally, this comes with risk given the execution and focus needed to efficiently open low-double-digit square footage growth while supporting comp growth through product innovation. In addition, the economic climate, particularly the employment picture, can affect consumer spending and the sportswear industry. A greater-than-expected downturn in household spending could cause sales trends to decelerate below our current assumptions, rendering our estimates too high. Roughly 40% of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the United States, w/ downside risk to our price target if the USD strengthens further & upside risk to our price target if the US and China Mainland accelerate to faster growth vs. our model.

Average WMTM units increased 44% y/y in 2Q25 from +3% in 1Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion.

Of the 220bps of tariff-related pressure this year, 170bps stems from the elimination of the exemption. Q3 gross margin is expected to be down 410bps YoY, which implies Q4 will be down ~600bps. While they expect some mitigation next year as well, they believe that the net impact to COGS from tariffs will be ~$320 million, or ~300bps to margins (implying another ~80bps of headwind next year). Tom's Takeaway #3: Markdowns Creeping Up As Well. In addition to the tariff headwind, elevated inventory levels (+21% in Q2 and expected to be up similar amounts in Q3 and Q4 as well) led to an expectation for incremental markdowns (now planned at a 50bps headwind for the year vs. 10-20bps headwind prior).

Alo has carved a niche in the premium/fashion segment of ath-leisure and is opening stores at a significant pace. Vuori is a brand that is beginning to take real market share from LULU in regions such as Southern California (where Vuori is headquartered). We also believe Fabletics is re-accelerating growth to the mid to high teens range. Notably many LULU alums have joined competitors in the past several years, driven by: 1) the changing culture at LULU and 2) a similar ethos to when LULU was in its early days. Further, the increased competition may force LULU to begin spending heavier on marketing, which could weigh on margins—notably LULU's marketing spend as a % of sales (4-5%) is one of the lowest among brands in our coverage (avg. 8-10%).

One of the issues facing LULU is the rise of new athleisure brands, some of whom are operating at similar price points and opening stores in similar real estate. With brands such as Alo, Vuori, Fabletics, Athleta, and others all providing \"athleisure\" options for consumers, we believe it is stifling LULU's growth. Additionally, other non-athletic brands have branched into the space (Free People Movement, Offline by Aerie, Victoria's Secret VSX, etc.), making the environment even more competitive. Another issue facing the company, in our view, is the trend shift towards denim (a category where LULU does not participate). Younger consumers have clearly gravitated to wide-leg jeans in recent years, potentially at the expense of LULU's core product (women's tight-fitting leggings). Maybe The Biz Needs A Breather After Such A Long Run. While trends have been choppy of late, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that LULU has been one of the biggest success stories in Softlines in the past 10-15 years. But given the fact that they basically tripled North American revenues between 2017 and 2023 and went viral post-pandemic with the \"belt bag\" phenomenon, the difficult multi-year compares might simply necessitate a \"lull\" before resuming the upward trajectory.

While it is hard to pin down the exact mix with the current refresh as neither AXP nor its merchant partners disclose it, we expect the percentage of merchant funding to tick up, and believe lululemon credit is at least co-funded. Partnership Benefits: The incentive for LULU and other merchant partners to participate in the co-funding of credits is AXP's affluent customer base. As of May 2025, approximately 55% of US consumer spend at Amex is from customers with $200k plus in annual income, which could result in additional sales lift beyond the value of the credit. More importantly, the credits are structured per quarter, which incentivizes consumer engagement with the Platinum card and the merchant throughout the year. Cost Sharing Between Amex and Merchants: There is limited disclosure on the mix of co- funded versus fully merchant funded. AXP did disclose that the $100 Saks credit in 2018 was fully merchant funded. In addition, at AXP's 2024 Investor Day, the company had highlighted ~27% of its Platinum card redeemed statement credits in 2023 was funded by partners, compared to 2% in 2018.

Many investors viewed Ms. Choe and Ms. Burgoyne as two of they key architects to LULU's ascendance, so the loss of both of these key executives, during a period of turbulence for the brand in North America, is not ideal. Ms. Burgoyne, in particular, was a key source of stability and consistency at LULU, having joined the company nearly 20 years ago, when revenues were a paltry $150 million (vs. nearly $8 billion in the Americas last year).

Lowe's gets 60% of products from the US, with China accounting for roughly 20% of purchasing volume. Both retailers will keep diversifying, while taking a portfolio approach to pricing.

Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing.

Puig faces a larger mismatch, given its greater mix of high-end fragrances imported from Europe, but has stronger pricing power vs. most other categories. Coty has struggled to rely solely on pricing, due to weaker US mass-market demand and its launch-pipeline gaps. Cost-cutting could help, but Ebit stays pressured.

The analysts’ assessment of these and other factors may produce an Analyst Risk Profile that may differ from the Quantitative Risk Profile. Increased competition and consumer’s trading down to lower priced products is a key risk factor that could impact the LULU’s overall market share. Moreover, rising input costs, inflated labor expenses, and growing property costs add to the company's risk factors. Changes in management could also impact the company's performance significantly. A downturn in consumer spending could cause households to cut back on apparel purchases, leading to a decline in revenue. Similarly, potential pandemics, geopolitical risks like wars or changes in government, and industry regulations could disrupt the company's operations and overall business performance. As with any company, factors like higher taxes, rising interest rates, and currency volatility can adversely affect profits.

Recall, we measure the promo levels in the \"We Made Too Much\" (WMTM) clearance section, and note that during FY3Q25 this section saw a notable increase in depth and frequency for the duration of the quarter. Average WMTM units increased +66% y/y in 3Q25 from +44% in 2Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion. The continued activity within its WMTM section raises questions about inventory management and full-price sell-through, particularly as the brand navigates challenges in its U.S. stores amidst increasing competition.

Tariff Exposure Update. 3Q25 GM decreased 290bps, driven primarily by tariffs, but also including 90bps of increased markdown pressure. Looking ahead, tariff-related headwinds are expected to weigh on 4Q25 GM by about 410bps, contributing to total GM guidance down 580bps. FY26 estimated tariff pressure of $320mn was not updated from the prior quarter's commentary. Tariff mitigation efforts continue to include strategic pricing actions, vendor negotiations, DC network efficiency, and enterprise wide savings initiatives. Prior Tariff Commentary. In FY25, tariff related pressure on GM is expected to amount to (220bps), up from prior tariff guidance of (40bps), with most of the heightened impact tied to (170bps) of de-minimis exemption impacts, and the balance attributable to higher underlying country rates. In FY26, the tariff pressure will continue, with an estimated tariff impact of ~$320mn likely to have an outsized impact on 1H26. We note that In LULU's most recent 10-K, the company provided details on its global manufacturing mix by country: \"During 2024, 40% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia, and 7% in Bangladesh, and the remainder in other regions.\" 3Q24 Earnings Call 12/5/24: \"We have very limited exposure in China, we source approximately 3% of goods from China.

Notably many LULU alums have joined competitors in the past several years, driven by: 1) the changing culture at LULU and 2) a similar ethos to when LULU was in its early days.

Ms. Nielsen is one of the most well-respected and capable executives in the industry, in our opinion.

Given her immense success at RL and Coach, we think she could help reinvigorate LULU if she were to come aboard. We would note, however, that the problems at RL and Coach were different than what LULU is facing at the moment.

China's 20% reciprocal tariff -- comparable with many trading partners -- offers modest relief to retailers after prior rates of up to 145%. The lower rate narrows cost disparities, but levies still pressure margins and supply chains. India's 50% duty is a growing concern for companies with greater sourcing exposure. Vertically integrated retailers are most vulnerable due to limited cost sharing, while large brands and online platforms may better absorb added costs given their size, efficiency and diversified sourcing.

Yet added costs can be partly offset through supplier negotiations and modest price hikes. Nike sources about 50% of its footwear from Vietnam, while On relies on the country for more than 90%. Steve Madden and HeyDude, which get over half of their supply from China, also face potential pressure, but might quickly adjust supply chains. Ending the de minimis exemption for China could level the playing field by targeting low-cost sellers like Temu and Shein, which may have to raise prices. Bulk shipping via PDD and Alibaba can offset some effects. Retailers like Lululemon could be negatively affected, given its distribution centers in Canada.

Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing.

The revamp can bolster consumer engagement through innovation and new products, reviving momentum in running and lifestyle. Fiscal 2026 sales may only modestly exceed analyst expectations, but we project nearly $1 billion in sales upside for 2027. CEO Elliott Hill’s product track record and the Nike-SKIMS launch should help reinforce momentum. Original Thesis (April 2024): Nike's sportswear lead can dominate the channel through product innovation and sports, which could end more than two years of downward earnings-estimate revisions and drive fiscal 2026 revenue at least $1 billion ahead of consensus.

Elaborating further, over the years NKE had shifted to a mentality of a tech company vs. sports company. Too much reliance on data and analytics which was a mistake. This led to poor decision-making and created the current marketplace issues that exist today. \"We’ve been in this situation before and will work our way through it over time.\" Certainly not pleased with their financial performance over the past few years, Hill has stated that the strategy was off, execution was off and while the organization did put a number of actions into place 12+ months, he believes there remains several areas where they simply need to move faster.", "file_path": "nlp\\raw_data\\bloomberg\\nke_research\\20251007_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Solid_1Q_Beat_w-_Puts_and_Takes_Go_Fwd-_-60_PT-_Sid.pdf"}

We are positive on Nike’s running and wholesale performance which showed early positive signs of its “Win Now” actions, although its near-term profit might be still challenging amid the US tariff.

Any faster-than-expected improvement in consumer spending in both regions could have a positive impact on Nike’s top line, exceeding our forecasts. • Faster gross margin expansion driven by better pricing and channel mix: If Nike’s inventory adjustment progresses faster than we expect, and its product mix improves on a greater contribution from new products, Nike’s gross margin would likely expand, helped by the contribution from full-priced products and the better channel mix. • Easing competition landscape: If Nike introduces new and innovative footwear and apparel products to increase its competitiveness, the recovery of sell-through could lead to market share gains that would boost its top line. • Lower-than-expected demand creation expenses: While management targets to bring its demand creation expense ratio back to the 10% range, we note any better-than-expected sales would likely lead to operating efficiency and result in earnings upside.

First - we have the setup: based on a triangulation of data points, we believe NKE exited FY23 with Classics at ~33% of total revenues and ~50% of footwear revenues. We believe FY23 was the Classics peak (negative commentary on AF1 had already emerged by 3Q24) - with a) peak footwear mix (68%) and b) footwear revenues growing +4% above total revenues (the largest spread since FY15 +3%). Second - we back into FY24 data as the base: by taking commentary from 4Q25 and 1Q26, along with feedback from channel checks, we build out quarterly assumptions for FY24 and FY25. We know that Classics were down more than 20% YoY in FY25, and we know that Classics were down > 30% in 4Q25 - resulting in a ~$1B revenue headwind. NKE also finished 4Q25 down 10% from peak Classics mix (we estimate of 39% of footwear vs our FY23 ~50% estimate).

Our own findings support management's comments on AJ1 and AF1 (stabilizing) and on Dunk (still work to do). While we do not believe Dunk is being \"reduced to zero\" we reiterate management's comments that Dunk was much less meaningful to the overall portfolio pre-COVID, and should become so again, post clean-up. Thus - with evidence that AJ1 and AF1 are nearing a bottom and with a view that Dunk reductions persist for another 12+ months (3Q25 conf call: \"We intend to drive [Classics] lower in fiscal 2026, with total units planned down double-digits with the most aggressive actions on the Dunk.\") we estimate that NKE will again reduce Classics sales (20%) YoY - to $9.1B in FY26 - and we believe Classics revenues level out around the ~$9B level in FY27E (which would mark a sizable decline from our estimated FY23 peak of $16B+). We also believe Classics revenues should mix back down to the < 20% range (total revenues) over the next 12-18 months - not just from the work NKE has/is doing on these franchises, but also from what we see as healthier underlying growth (we discuss this in just a bit).

Based on Conf Call comments, filings commentary and trend analysis across several metrics in NA, last year we believe NKE accelerated wholesale sales to off-price and closeout accounts relative to normalized levels in order to accelerate NA market cleanup. Our work in this section will support a view that the majority of this clean-up occurred in 2Q25 and 3Q25 (weighted to 3Q25). • First, we look at reported data in an attempt to quantify the amount of elevated / extraordinary wholesale sales by quarter • Second, we back this work up with CC and filing comments, as well as trend analysis • Third, we conclude that this headwind normalizes by 4Q26E.

We see two large drivers of the sequential deterioration.

Next (second) it's important to understand the 3 main drivers of the \"Other\" costs: 1) Inventory reserves, 2) Sales reserves and 3) Obsolescence. We think a quick accounting recap of inventory reserves is helpful - from the NKE 10-K: “If the net realizable value of inventory is estimated to be less than the cost of the inventory, a reserve is recorded equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. As of May 31, 2025, the Company's inventory reserve was $233 million compared to $155 million as of May 31, 2024. “ Thus, we calculate the $78M negative change in inventory reserves as -20bps of the overall -90bps impact in FY25 - leaving -70bps to explain.

As a reminder, China GM by quarter: 1Q25 -170bps; 2Q25 -490bps; 3Q25 -580bps; 4Q25 -520bps. So while NKE had multiple GM issues in FY25, clearly, China was a drag on overall GM. In the context of an FY26 GM build we see China as a drag at least through the current quarter (-450bps, or -69bps to the total company) and at best neutral in 2H26 as clean up work continues, albeit against easier compares in 3Q (-760bps) and 4Q (-675bps). 14 | Equity Research This document is being provided for the exclusive use of SIMON KURONO at UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.

This view is based on channel work and multiple industry contacts/ checks. Below we look at 1) NT macro and broader trends in sport/athletics, 2) our thoughts on Classics clean-up and general marketplace clean-up and 3) our view of a GM recapture timeline - we assume margins start to normalize (some) before sales potentially turn. NT Macro Still a Headwind, and Performance Running > Lifestyle Our checks over the past several months point to a generally constrained Chinese consumer who remains in a \"wait and see\" mode. We believe that any direct stimulus is more focused on housing (and related) and not on general retail. Our checks also confirm a significant rise in running participation with the Chinese government spending several billion on direct investment in trails and parks. While favorable for NKE's performance running platforms, this does extend the headwind on Classics clean- up, and suggests a more indirect investment in athletics (though our checks noted the investment potentially grows TAM from 450M people in China to 650M next few years - which would be a LT positive for NKE).

We do not model any other income or expense. Lastly, we model a 20% tax rate FY26 and 18% rate FY27 (the relative recovery in China should help lower the overall rate). \"Unboxing\" Our WFS EPS Bull Case Build In sneaker culture, very little beats an epic \"unboxing\" of a hyped purchase. So, after building the hype, we unbox our FY26 and FY27 Bull Case EPS views. With the inputs above - we can build to $1.90 in FY26 and $3.15 in FY27 (or, approximately ~$2.00 and ~$3.00). These estimates would represent > 15% and > 25% upside vs. Street's current $1.64 and $2.49. 20 | Equity Research This document is being provided for the exclusive use of SIMON KURONO at UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Proprietary PRISM Curve: NKE Fundamentals Are Bottoming From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of a potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 1 and Figure 2 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe NKE is in the latter stage of the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises.

Value Handoff to Next Investor NKE Source: Barclays Research 10 December 2025 8 Barclays | Nike, Inc. NKE Recovery Play by Play: FY26 Is the Rebase Year FY26 is the Rebase Year. The sequence of recoveries is typically a 3-year horizon – Reset in Year 1 (FY25A), Rebase in Year 2 (FY26E), and Regrow in Year 3 (FY27E). The Rebase year is often a stutter-step year as a company stabilizes the business to return to profitable growth. With NKE a battleground stock, we lay out our catalyst roadmap for the next several quarters as we see them playing out. We leave it for different investor styles, risk, and horizons to determine when to time the “buy” of the stock. As for us, we remain sidelined with expectation of downside revision risk. While we rely heavily on a positive inflection in the sales-to-inventory spread, we note that a positive inflection in the sales-to-inventory growth spread assumes sales growth is, at worst, status quo to current trends. On the FY1Q26 call, the IM Spread did indeed inflect positively, but management commentary suggested recent weaker trends in Greater China and APAC. FY2Q26 beat: For FY2Q26, we expect NKE to beat with sales better-than-expected driven from the wholesale channel. NKE guidance was for negative low single-digit (including 1 point from FX), versus the Street of -1.2%.

Bear view. We think the Bear case has the following main points: 1) the loss of NKE's historical brand heat and momentum as the company struggles to innovate at scale; 2) unproven and untested product driving future sales into calendar 2026; 3) ongoing margin pressure from negative sales growth, the mix shift to wholesale, promotional pressure, and tariff headwinds, all leading to sub-10% operating margins for the foreseeable future; and 4) competitive threats from new entrants.

We look for evidence that margins and earnings have bottomed and NKE is entering a period of sustained \"beat-and-raise\" financial performance. The first P&L impact metric we look for is positive y/y merchandise margin inflection. We believe the return to GM inflection is centered on more full-price selling driven by cleaning up of the channel coupled with desirable and innovative brand heat products. Recall, we foresee six sources of margin pressure in FY26 from: 1) sales pressure as NKE resets the marketplace; 2) return of demand creation to ~10% of sales; 3) product and channel mix headwinds; 4) return of price concessions, offset by price increases to mitigate tariff impact, to drive wholesale channel restocking; 5) franchise management of AJ1, AF1, and especially Dunk; and 6) negative impact from 10 December 2025 12 Barclays | Nike, Inc. tariffs.

Reaching 4.5% retail-sales growth in 2025 now requires a 9% year-on-year jump in December, or at least a 4% gain under our 4.1% forecast -- levels that hinge on continued strength in subsidized categories. Perks introduced in 2025 can buoy December sales in mobile phones, office goods and furniture, but without new incentives for autos and home appliances, these targets look lofty.

The revamp can bolster consumer engagement through innovation and new products, reviving momentum in running and lifestyle.

Headwinds include the impact of tariffs on costs and demand. (12/18/25) Key Topics Summary Near-Term Outlook Choppy:A weaker economy and lower direct-to-consumer sales are weighing on Nike, with consensus expecting total revenue to fall by low-single digits in fiscal 2026, with low- to mid-single-digit declines in 1H while sales in 2H could revert to gains. Gross margin might contract on higher markdowns to clear elevated inventory, tariff headwinds and shifts in channel mix, partly offset by price hikes and cost-mitigation efforts. Regions At Fore:Nike's sales may drop by a low-single-digit percentage in fiscal 2026, based on consensus, as economic weakness and higher markdowns to clear excess inventory crimp sales. Growth is expected to turn positive in 2H.

The revamp can bolster consumer engagement through innovation and new products, reviving momentum in running and lifestyle. Fiscal 2026 sales may only modestly exceed analyst expectations, but we project nearly $1 billion in sales upside for 2027. CEO Elliott Hill’s product track record and the Nike-SKIMS launch should help reinforce momentum. Original Thesis (April 2024): Nike's sportswear lead can dominate the channel through product innovation and sports, which could end more than two years of downward earnings-estimate revisions and drive fiscal 2026 revenue at least $1 billion ahead of consensus. The return of major sporting events, accelerated innovation and expectations for upbeat forecasts at its analyst meeting in 2H are catalysts.

Lazada's share slipped to about 14% from 16%, reflecting slower GMV growth as the company focuses on profitability and higher- margin categories. TikTok Shop and Tokopedia -- which integrated with TikTok Shop in Indonesia -- have a combined share of 28%, making it Shopee's biggest challenger in 2026. These platforms control nearly 94% of Southeast Asia's platform GMV, signaling a shift from a fragmented market phase to one where scale, efficiency and monetization will be key.

Proprietary PRISM Curve: NKE Fundamentals Are Bottoming From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of a potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 1 and Figure 2 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe NKE is in the latter stage of the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises.

Tariff Exposure Update. In 2Q26, NA GM declined 330bps, including a 520bps impact from tariffs. 3Q26 GM is expected to decline 175bps to 225bps, which includes a 315bps headwind due to higher product costs from tariffs. FY26 net tariff headwind after mitigation efforts of 120bps, equal to $1.5B in annualized incremental gross product costs, remains unchanged from the prior quarter's guidance. Prior Tariff Commentary. Based on reciprocal tariff rates as of NKE's FY1Q26 call on 9/30/25, NKE raised its expected impact from tariffs on an annualized gross incremental cost basis to approx. $1.5bn (up from $1.0bn). The company expected the net headwind to GM to increase to 120bps (from 75bps) for FY26, with a 175bps impact to FY2Q26. The company continues to expect to mitigate these new costs over time.

One of the first things CEO Hill spoke about in this regard is the culture. While this is a fairly broad statement, Hill elaborated on his view that \"culture\" is about several key dynamics that need to be in place in order to drive the Nike brand—putting sport back at the center of everything they do, taking insights from their athletes and turning that into great product and improving storytelling behind their consumer led marketplace (with Direct and Wholesale working together). Elaborating further, over the years NKE had shifted to a mentality of a tech company vs. sports company. Too much reliance on data and analytics, which was a mistake. This led to poor decision-making and created the current marketplace issues that exist today. \"We’ve been in this situation before and will work our way through it over time.\" Certainly not pleased with their financial performance over the past few years, Hill has stated that the strategy was off, execution was off and while the organization did put a number of actions into place 12+ months, he believes there remains several areas where they simply need to move faster.", "file_path": "nlp\\raw_data\\bloomberg\\nke_research\\20251226_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_America-s_Great_Again...China_Not_So_Much-_Numbers.pdf"}

At the same time newer competitors like On and Hoka have also captured share in China on the rise of trail and road running, at the expense of basketball. These companies' focus on sport/technology has led to lifestyle success as well—mirroring broader trends in athletic participation.
