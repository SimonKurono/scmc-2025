The Prospectus Supplement relates to the sale by the selling stockholders identified in the Prospectus Supplement (those stockholders, the “Selling Stockholders”), of up to 12,210,573 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.005 per share. These shares of common stock have been issued or are issuable to the Selling Stockholders upon the exchange of an equivalent number of the exchangeable shares of Lulu Canadian Holding, Inc.

The shares of common stock offered by the Prospectus Supplement were previously registered for resale under a prospectus supplement dated July 15, 2016, and the accompanying base prospectus filed with a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-212540), which the Company filed on July 15, 2016. Because that registration statement expires three years after it was filed, the Company filed the Registration Statement to replace the expiring registration statement and to cover unsold securities covered by the expiring registration statement. The Company is filing the opinion of its counsel, DLA Piper LLP (US), as Exhibit 5.1 hereto, regarding the legality of the shares of common stock covered by the Prospectus Supplement.",nlp/raw_data/sec_filings_8k/lulu/8-K/0001397187-19-000055.txt

As a result, COVID-19 has impacted our business globally, including through store closures or reduced operating hours and/or decreased retail traffic. In particular, the outbreak and preventive measures taken have had a material negative impact on our sales and operations in Greater China during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 following the temporary closure of, or reduced operating hours in, approximately 75 percent of NIKE-owned and partner stores in Greater China. Similarly, effective as of March 16, 2020, we temporarily closed stores in multiple regions around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and as a result, we expect our sales and business in these regions will be adversely impacted. Additional store closures by us and our partners globally have been and may be required and there can be no assurance as to how long these closures may remain in effect. Furthermore, even after reopening there can be no assurance as to the time required to regain operations and sales at prior levels. However, as of March 24, 2020, approximately 80 percent of NIKE-owned and partner stores in Greater China have reopened and are operating at normal business hours, and we have seen the Greater",nlp/raw_data/sec_filings_8k/nke/8-K/0001193125-20-084362.txt

Additionally, we completed the sale of the Hurley brand and recognized an immaterial gain on sale. Both the Hurley gain on sale and the charge associated with the transition in South America were recognized in Other (income) expense, net on our Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the sale of the Hurley business, the Company estimates that revenue growth in North America was adversely impacted by approximately 1-2 percentage points during the third quarter. COVID-19 has also impacted our distribution centers and our third party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures to accommodate social distancing guidelines. Additionally, this outbreak may impact distribution and logistics providers’ ability to operate or may increase their operating costs.
