- High demand has led to limited sizes and colors after a big Black Friday sale.
- I went shopping for my own Super Puff to see if it was a good fit for me.
I was on the hunt for a new winter coat, and my journey led me to the Aritzia in New York City's SoHo neighborhood.
The Canadian retailer is known for its polished and minimalist silhouettes. However, it has another viral specialty that I wasn't aware of until this year.
The Super Puff, Aritzia's puffer coat, seems to have a dedicated following. It's recognizable from the ""S"" logo printed on the hood, and I've been seeing it everywhere this winter — from the sidewalks of New York City to colleagues in my office to viral videos of people trying on an oversize version in stores.
Finally, I gave in and ventured to the second floor of the SoHo Aritzia, where people swarmed the seemingly endless racks of puffer coats. From knee-length jackets to cropped vests, they took up two-thirds of the floor. I took a deep breath and dove into the chaos of shoppers.
I wanted to see if the Super Puff lived up to the hype
After browsing among the throng of shoppers, I flagged down an associate with a simple question.
""What's all this hype about?"" I asked.
She launched into her spiel about the weather-resistant, goose-down-filled, and reliable coats. They come in a variety of styles, which Aritzia expanded this year. The SuperSnug, which I spotted in the store, cinches at the waist. The prices range from less than $200 to nearly $400 — the priciest style being the waterproof SuperSnug.
The online hype also appears to be real. Intelligence platform PeakMetrics analyzed a sample of TikTok and Instagram posts about the Aritzia Super Puff from November 3 to December 14, a period that includes the year's biggest shopping holidays. It found that the conversation volume across the sites increased by 8,100% during that time as the temperature dropped and people picked up their warmer coats again.
The overall tone of the conversation was positive, with some posts calling the jacket ""INCREDIBLE 10/10,"" PeakMetrics told Business Insider.
However, the demand was evident when I saw for myself that the racks were mainly filled with sizes small, extra-small, and extra-extra-small. While searching for options in black in my size, the associate told me that many of the styles and sizes were sold out companywide until an expected January 8 restock. She said the store was wiped out of most sizes during its Black Friday sale.
My plans changed quickly
I hadn't planned to buy a jacket that day, but I was still bummed that my size wasn't available in any black styles. I called my mom in frustration, hoping this could be my Christmas gift if I was lucky enough to find a large. She told me she'd already bought me a black puffer coat from Gap on Black Friday.
Dreams deflated, I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and try out more bold colors. That's how I found an extra large in the shade ""modern taupe."" The ""liquid shine"" fabric, as described on the label, gave it a shimmering gold or Champagne color.
The original silhouette was $298 before taxes. I found the price reasonable compared to other popular winter coat brands, such as Canada Goose or Moncler, which can reach over $1,000.
I tried on the extra-large, and I immediately knew it was a serious contender. The only other option was the white Supersnug in a large. I liked the cinched silhouette, but the color didn't suit me.
After some convincing from the sales associate and a conversation with my mom, I decided to go ahead with the modern taupe original Super Puff.
As a native Texan, I consulted with my New Yorker friends who assured me I'd made a good choice. They've all had their Super Puff coats for years (I wasn't aware so many of them owned one).
I'll be the judge of whether it was a worthy Christmas gift to myself as I get as many wears out of it as possible.

Aritzia is taking a more precise approach to managing its inventory.
On Tuesday, the Canadian retailer announced its partnership with Nedap—whose item-level visibility tools are increasingly powering smart retail operations—to overhaul how it tracks, manages and moves product.
Through the partnership, Aritzia will deploy Nedap’s ID Cloud platform to achieve real-time, item-level stock accuracy across its fleet, which it says will support better product availability both in stores and online while giving teams a more secure, scalable operational backbone.
The technology will also bolster Aritzia’s unified commerce capabilities, optimizing ship-from-store, in-store pickup and return workflows so clients receive a consistently smooth experience regardless of channel, according to Nedap.
“We provide a seamless, elevated experience to our clients,” said Elisse Shank, senior director of omni at Aritzia. “Partnering with Nedap will help us gain clearer insight into our inventory to further enhance our client services.”
According to Nedap, its ID Cloud platform—used by other industry giants like Adidas, Under Armour and PVH Corp., to name a few—is an integrated suite of SaaS solutions built specifically for radio-frequency identification (RFID)-enabled retail operations. At its core is an electronic product code information services (EPCIS) repository—a GS1 global standard for capturing and sharing item-level event data across the supply chain—allowing for consistent, interoperable communication between systems and partners.
By leveraging this foundation, retailers like Aritzia can improve inventory accuracy at scale, reduce waste and losses and drive higher sell-through and customer satisfaction.
“We are proud to welcome Aritzia into our global ID Cloud community,” said Bruno Bakker, director for Nedap ID Cloud North America. “Their strong focus on innovation and client experience mirrors our own vision. By enabling item-level inventory visibility, we are laying the foundation for truly unified commerce—helping our partners meet customer expectations seamlessly across every touchpoint.”
Retailers already using ID Cloud are seeing measurable gains.
River Island, for example, reported inventory accuracy climbing above 98 percent through weekly RFID cycle counts, with on-shelf availability surpassing 99 percent thanks to real-time replenishment. The technology also allowed the U.K. retailer to cut overall stock levels by 30 to 40 percent without sacrificing availability—freeing up capital, reducing waste and improving sell-through. Additional benefits include faster stock takes, more precise replenishment and RFID-enabled loss prevention, as well as fitting room insights that helped convert 61 percent of try-ons into purchases, Nedap noted.
“The initiative wasn’t just about boosting efficiency and improving stock accuracy through real-time inventory visibility,” Nedap explained in its River Island case study. “It was a strategic move to future-proof retail operations, elevate customer experience and enable more sustainable inventory practices.”",https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/technology/aritzia-nedap-rfid-enhances-store-operations-efficiency-1234791778/

The Canadian company’s beloved for its outerwear, which is designed to be warm enough to withstand the country’s brutal winters. On Aritzia’s website, shoppers can even filter options by their level of warmth, from “warmish” (ideal for temperatures 32 degrees or above) to “extreme warm” (which promises to keep you toasty even when it’s 40 degrees below zero).
While the brand’s become synonymous with its Super Puff range in recent years, I’m partial to Aritzia’s Slouch Coat, a classic piece I’ve owned and loved for the past four years — and that happens to be on sale right now in every single color.
Aritzia The Slouch Coat in (Re)Camel Wool
Made from a blend of recycled camel hair and virgin wool, the relaxed, double-breasted topper is designed to keep you comfortable in temperatures as low as 4 degrees below zero.
Having worn it during polar vortexes and snowstorms, I can confirm it punches well above its weight in the warmth department; that’s thanks not only to the coat’s camel-hair construction, but also the brand’s super-thin UnReal Suede interlining, which adds extra wind protection.
In addition to looking far more expensive than it actually is, the coat is a layering lover’s best friend, thanks to its dolman sleeves and intentionally oversized cut. I wear mine over long-sleeved tees and dresses in the fall, but it can easily accommodate chunky sweaters and blazers when temperatures plunge.
The Slouch Coat‘s also found a fan in Sabrina Carpenter, who’s been spotted wearing it many times over the past couple of years — most recently for an NYC lunch date on a below-freezing day in mid-December. And since the coat comes in Short, Regular and Tall sizes, it fits the 5-foot-tall pop star just as well as it does this 5-foot-11 fashion editor.
Aritzia The Slouch Coat in (Re)Camel Wool
The slouchy style’s a hit with shoppers, too, having amassed close to 200 glowing online reviews to date; “I have literally nothing bad to say about this coat. It’s absolutely phenomenal and keeps me so warm during the winter. It’s a MUST,” one wrote.
“Surprisingly warm and timelessly stylish,” another customer noted, while a third simply said that it’s “worth every penny.”
In addition to classic black (as seen on Carpenter) and tan (my pick), the camel-hair version of the Slouch Coat comes in several different hues of brown, and new seasonal shades are rolled out each year.
Aritzia The Slouch Coat in (Re)Camel Wool
The style is also available in an equally warm wool-cashmere blend in several colors, including light gray and a black-and-white herringbone pattern. On Reddit, you’ll find plenty of shoppers debating the merits of one fabrication over the other, but you really can’t go wrong with either one.
With NYC’s most bone-chillingly cold months of the year still to come — and my trusty Slouch Coat still looking as good as new after several years of regular wear — I know what I’ll be bundling up in for the rest of winter.

The apparel retailer head also asks Ottawa ""to get out of our way,"" as he says recent immigration rules deter finding talent
The founder and executive chair of Vancouver-based retailerAritzia Inc. said Canada needs to follow the American lead in lowering the limit on the duty-free shopping exemption.
Brian Hill, whose family opened the first Aritzia store in British Columbia’s largest city in 1984, also said immigration policy is costing his luxury clothing operation some top talent, during an event on Wednesday.
Hill acknowledged that “on the tariffs, the playing field is level. All our competitors are dealing with the same tariffs,” he told the Real Estate Forum in Toronto.
However, the same can’t be said for rules governing what is called the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed international packages valued at less than US$800 to enter America duty-free.
The United States ended that exemption in August and it is costing Aritzia $100 million annually, he said.
“We are shipping about 70 per cent to 80 per cent of our product from our distribution centres in Vaughan (north of Toronto) and one in Vancouver. And about 80 per cent of our e-commerce business is going to the U.S. We are now paying duty on all the products going into the U.S.,” said Hill.
His issue is that Canada is not doing anything similar. “We are always quite late to the party,” said Hill, noting that while the de minimis exemption is lower in Canada at only $150, it is still a level that exempts most imports based on average transactions.
“A lot of the fast fashion is shipping into Canada duty-free,” said Hill, adding that it includes online companies from China but also the United States. “If anybody knows the Prime Minister, we would appreciate getting rid of this or taking it down.”
In an interview with the Financial Post, Hill said his call for changes to de minimis exemptions in Canada was not about retaliation but to even the playing field at home.

“We have a $1.5 billion business in Canada and pay duty on every one of those items that come into Canada that we give to our clients,” he said. “But a large portion of products sold in Canada through e-commerce channels comes in duty-free because they don’t have a warehouse here, and they ship it duty-free from China, (or other countries). All these Canadian retailers are at a disadvantage.”
Hill also called on the Canadian government “to get out of our way” of businesses, targeting immigration issues. The federal government recently reduced permanent resident admission targets to 380,000 per year for three years, down from 395,000 in 2025.
“We are trying to build our teams,” he said, adding Aritzia is not looking to tap the temporary foreign worker market. “We are trying to grow our business and trying to be an international retailer.”
But immigration laws are making it costly for Aritzia to source skilled positions such as pattern makers, Hill said. “We can’t bring them in. … We need these people to create beautiful products, and Canada doesn’t have them.”
The company has lost candidates, or at least been inconvenienced, he said.
“If we are really pumped on someone, we have to pay for them for a really long time and to keep them idle to go through the motions (of immigration),” Hill said. “What we need are qualified senior people who have experience.”

Despite turmoil from the trade war, most global markets approached the end of the year in the black
The rise of artificial intelligence drove bubble fears in stock markets around the world in 2025, but investors who stuck it out were well rewarded. Despite turmoil from the trade war, most global markets approached the end of the year in the black. When it came to individual stocks and commodities, however, some had it better than others. Here, the Financial Post’s Gigi Suhanic takes a look at five winners and five losers from the year in investing.
Winners
Aritzia
The Vancouver-based clothing retailer known for its Super Puff jackets and Effortless Pant was one of the top performers on the TSX in 2025. By late December, Aritzia Inc. shares (TSX:ATZ) had more than doubled to about $112 as it continued to make headway in the U.S., which accounted for 58 per cent of its revenue for the fiscal 2025 year. Analyst Stephen MacLeod at BMO Capital Markets recently hiked his price target to $130 from $110 based on continued U.S. expansion plans; the company is also attracting attention from the investment community south of the border, with Goldman Sachs analyst Jonathan Keypour initiating coverage on Dec. 11 with a buy rating and a price target of $130, citing Aritzia’s “large untapped U.S. opportunity.”
The TSX
The S&P/TSX composite index turned the tables on the major U.S. stock markets this year, defying Donald Trump‘s trade war to outperform its southern brethren. With just a few trading days left in the year, the TSX is up approximately 27 per cent, double the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 13.5 per cent gain, and well ahead of both the S&P 500 index at 16 per cent and the NASDAQ at 20 per cent. The trend of U.S. outperformance was upended as investors flocked to metals miners to cash in on big gains in gold and silver, while financials, specifically Canada’s Big Six banks, also helped power the TSX. This year’s stellar gain comes on the heels of a 19 per cent gain in 2024, leaving investors asking if a third big year is ahead in 2026.
Silver
The price of silver more than doubled in 2025, surpassing its flashier counterpart, gold, which jumped a meagre 63 per cent. The silver and gold duo were market darlings as investors sought to surf the trends of “rising levels of sovereign debt, persistent inflation, a weaker (U.S. dollar), continued pressure for lower rates and strong physical demand from central banks/stablecoins,” National Bank Capital Markets said in a note. Analysts think those driving forces will remain in play in 2026. Silver, which traded above US$67 as of Dec. 19, also benefited from its importance as a material in industrial uses, with the U.S. also adding it to its list of critical metals. It’s rise helped make Discovery Silver Corp. (TSX:DSV) the TSX’s top gainer for the year by a wide margin, up 1,083 per cent.
Celestica
Celectica Inc. (TSX:CLS) stood out among the top 10 gainers on the TSX as the only non-metals name of 2025, up more than 200 per cent as of late December. The Toronto-based electronics component manufacturer has transformed into an artificial intelligence infrastructure play and been swept up in the exuberance that powered U.S. markets. The AI theme has suffered of late as markets worry about the sector on several fronts, including massive debt issuances and spending delays at some big U.S. companies. But JPMorgan Chase and Co. still sees Celestica as one of the companies that will benefit from capital spending of AI “hyperscalers” such as Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Shares of Celestica were trading above $407 in late December.
Alphabet
OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first artificial intelligence chatbot to capture the public’s imagination, but it looks like Google parent Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq/GOOG) is rapidly closing the gap. Alphabet lapped the rest of the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2025, rising 62 per cent by late December with the closest competition coming from Nvidia Corp., up 32 per cent. A survey from TD Cowen showed that a growing share of ChatGPT users were also using Google’s Gemini 3 chatbot and that people are increasingly using AI in search. Alphabet also got a major boost in November when it was revealed that tech-wary Berkshire Hathaway Inc. had taken a stake. Alphabet shares were trading at nearly US$310 in late December.
Losers
Lululemon
Aritzia may have soared in 2025, but Lululemon Athletica Inc. (Nasdaq/LULU) stumbled. Shares of the athleisure maker were languishing down more than 55 per cent through late November, but staged a mini comeback in December on news that chief executive Calvin McDonald would step down and that an activist investor was taking a stake. A shrinking U.S. market and revelations that pricey yoga tights were landing in discount bins were among Lululemon’s troubles. The death of the U.S. de minimis rule didn’t help either, as much of Lulu’s online distribution came from outside that country. Then came the attack ad against McDonald from Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, which urged for a leadership change. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik called McDonald’s departure the “most constructive development for shareholders in years.” Some analysts have since hiked their outlooks, though the 12-month average price target of US$205 sits around where the stock was trading in late December.
Constellation Software
Long-time TSX darling Constellation Software Inc. (TSX:CSU) fell out of favour in 2025, as investors worried about the impact of AI and the departure of founder Mark Leonard, who stepped down as president in September, citing health concerns. Overall, shares were down 25 per cent as of mid-December, landing it on the list the top 10 losers for the year. Software providers suffered in general in 2025, CIBC Capital Markets said in a note, as investment dollars felt the gravitational pull of AI infrastructure. CIBC analyst Stephanie Price cited “company specific headwinds and AI concerns” for the shares’ losses, but she thinks the outlook will improve in 2026 as some of that AI money starts to benefit software companies. Constellation was trading at $3,336 in Toronto on Dec. 19.
West Fraser Timber
West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (TSX:WFG) was felled in 2025 by Donald Trump’s lumber tariffs, with shares of the company down just under 35 per cent, making it the biggest loser on the TSX in 2025. In mid-October, a 10 per cent duty on global timber imports to the U.S. came into effect. That was on top of already existing American tariffs of 35 per cent on Canadian lumber. In addition to the 10 per cent tariff, Trump also imposed a 25 per cent levy on wooden cabinet and vanity imports, which is set to rise to 50 per cent in the new year. Despite the tough year, some analysts have hiked their 2026 price targets for West Fraser. They include Matthew McKellar at RBC Capital Markets, who thinks the company’s stock price looks attractive and has West Fraser as one of his top picks for 2026.
Orange juice
It’s been a sour year for orange juice with futures contracts for frozen concentrate down 66 per cent. The breakfast staple was the target of retaliatory tariffs in Canada in the initial aftermath of Donald Trump’s trade war, with the U.S. Census Bureau reporting in August that orange juice shipments to Canada had sunk by 20 per cent. But the removal of Canada’s duties didn’t seem to juice the outlook for OJ, which more generally has been suffering from sagging demand as dietary habits change. This year’s decline marked a major turn of fortunes for the futures, which soared at the end of 2024 as drought, disease, flooding and storms hit crops around the world including in the U.S.
Chipotle
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE/CMG) went on a major run after U.S. hedge fund titan Bill Ackman bought into the fast food juggernaut in the wake of a tainted food scandal in 2015. But things caught up with Chipotle this year, with shares down 40 per cent as investors mulled over the effects of inflation and a more cautious consumer. Even Ackman decided he had had enough, selling his remaining stake in the Mexican fast-casual chain. Since hitting an all-time high in 2024 of US$68.55, Chipotle shares are down 48 per cent and were trading at around US$38 in late December.
