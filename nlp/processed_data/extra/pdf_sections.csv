There's opportunity to increase online sales separate from store growth as the Canadian company employs specific e- commerce measures.

Aritzia's 2027 target for a 19% Ebitda margin can be exceeded by 100-200 bps as the company begins to market online, since the fast growing US e-commerce business is more profitable than in-store.

That's just a small premium to Urban Outfitters (including the Anthropologie and Free People brands) and Abercrombie & Fitch -- top destinations for Aritzia customers. It's also above Oxford Industries (Tommy Bahama, Johnny Was), which has lower expected growth (3%) but higher cash conversion (54%). Aritzia's valuation can increase as sales climb and Ebitda margin rises (with a company target at 19% by 2026, and we believe may reach the low 20% range). The multiple at Lululemon, also a top Aritzia customer haunt, trades well higher on strong marquee metrics. Select Aritzia private brands -- like Super Puff jackets -- appear to be gaining a strong following that add franchise value. (11/06/23) This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

The assortment features exceptional design and function with prices about a third those of Canada Goose and lower still than Moncler. Outerwear typically boasts higher margins than other apparel, which can support a larger sales multiple. The Super Puff, which we calculate accounts for 5-10% of Aritzia sales, has been sought by shoppers because of its fashion and fit, array of colors and options, and performance in freezing temperatures. It took off in 2018 when Kendall Jenner sported a bright red Super Puff, and other celebrities have flocked to the jackets.

Aritzia's multiple lead on Abercrombie and Urban Outfitters could grow as its sales increase -- possibly by the midteens -- and its margin rises to its historical high-teens or possibly above 20%.

That's just a small premium to Urban Outfitters (including the Anthropologie and Free People brands) and Abercrombie & Fitch -- top destinations for Aritzia customers. It's also above Oxford Industries (Tommy Bahama, Johnny Was), which has lower expected growth (3%) but higher cash conversion (54%). Aritzia's valuation can increase as sales climb and Ebitda margin rises (with a company target at 19% by 2026, and we believe may reach the low 20% range). The multiple at Lululemon, also a top Aritzia customer haunt, trades well higher on strong marquee metrics. Select Aritzia private brands -- like Super Puff jackets -- appear to be gaining a strong following that add franchise value. (11/06/23) This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

Aritzia's US Store Expansion, Social Marketing May Fuel Growth",0,1,1,"(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- Aritzia's US store footprint could triple over the next several years from 48 currently, with 100 locations identified as meeting its standards. As recent boutique openings exceed hurdle rates and new e-commerce marketing takes hold, sales and margin expansion may top expectations. The company's model of selling mostly at full price -- we estimate that it makes up 80% of sales -- distinguishes Aritzia in a US market loaded with promotions. Only Lululemon takes a similar tack, which is likely a big factor in its 27% Ebitda margin. Aritzia's 2027 target for a 19% Ebitda margin can be exceeded by 100-200 bps as the company begins to market online, since the fast growing US e-commerce business is more profitable than in-store.

As recent boutique openings exceed hurdle rates and new e-commerce marketing takes hold, sales and margin expansion may top expectations. The company's model of selling mostly at full price -- we estimate that it makes up 80% of sales - - distinguishes Aritzia in a US market loaded with promotions. Only Lululemon takes a similar tack, which is likely a big factor in its 27% Ebitda margin. Aritzia's 2027 target for a 19% Ebitda margin can be exceeded by 100-200 bps as the company begins to market online, since the fast growing US e-commerce business is more profitable than in-store.

They generated C$8 million in sales in their first year, which we believe will reach C$13 million in year three. The boutiques feature an array of high-quality, well- designed apparel and draw a broad range of middle- to higher-income female customers. Stores opened over the past year fully covered the initial investment ahead of the company's 12-18- month target, meaning their economics were better than expected. Aritzia's new-shop metrics are stronger than Lululemon's two-year payback and C$1,400 in sales per square foot.

New US stores' sales exceeded hurdle rates in 2Q, comprising half the sales lift. Ebitda margin may also beat management's outlook for 400-450 bps and analysts' 478 bps for the full year, with further upside in 2025, mostly from additional mark-on opportunities and as growth from new and repositioned stores leverage fixed costs. Balanced inventories also support margin, minimizing markdown risk. US sales are tracking above consensus.

Both factors might have bigger effects in 4Q. Observed sales declined markedly in October, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, after improving in September, when sales per customer and average transaction value rose as well.

Guidance is for an improvement of 400-500 bps in 2024, though our scenario shows a 650-bp rise as elevated product costs and temporary warehousing expenses give way to higher initial markups, price increases, lower material costs and efficiencies. Management targets a 19% margin by 2026 -- we think it can reach over 20% -- as the more profitable US and online segments supersede Canada. The boost to margin in 2024 will have four components: 150 bps from select price increases and lower product costs; 150-200 bps from 150 initiatives, including better processes and vendor negotiations saving C$60 million annualized; 125 bps from eliminating temporary warehousing; and sales leverage.

Existing stores are being expanded as well, lifting sales above expectations. Instead of retrenching during the pandemic, the company took the opportunity to secure superior, larger flagship locations in New York (at triple the previous size) and Chicago, along with other locations -- all at reduced costs. The flagships are set to open this year. (08/23/24) ""We are disciplined and patient and do not compromise on our real estate selections.

With recent boutique openings exceeding hurdle rates and e-commerce and social-media campaigns gaining traction, sales and margin expansion can top consensus. Its model of selling mostly at full price, which we calculate as making up 80% of sales, distinguishes Aritzia in a US market flush with promotions. Only Lululemon takes a similar tack, likely a big factor in its 27% Ebitda margin. Aritzia may surpass its 19% Ebitda margin target for 2027 by 100-200 bps as it boosts online marketing, with the fast-growing US e-commerce business more profitable than in-store.

Instead of retrenching during the pandemic, the company took the opportunity to secure superior, larger flagship locations in New York (at triple the previous size) and Chicago, along with other locations -- all at reduced costs. The flagships are set to open this year. (08/23/24) ""We are disciplined and patient and do not compromise on our real estate selections.

Full-year Ebitda margin guidance of 15.5-16.5% was sustained despite higher tariff pressure (280 bps vs. 150 bps prior), and compares with 14.8% in 2024. Margin growth reflects higher markups, cost controls and reduced reliance on China. Goods sourced from China for spring/summer 2026 should account for around 5% of the total. About 12 new boutiques (six in 3Q) and five expanded and repositioned stores are planned for the full year. The company targets midteens comparable-sales growth in 3Q.

Instead of retrenching during the pandemic, the company took the opportunity to secure superior, larger flagship locations in New York (at triple the previous size) and Chicago, along with other locations -- all at reduced costs.

Gap, Ralph Lauren Lift Technology Spending, Tap AI Ralph Lauren is leading in retail innovation by integrating generative AI across design, storytelling and customer experience. The company uses AI for digital samples, Polo Bear video stories and its Ask Ralph recommendation tool. It's also enhancing search, predictive buying and customer engagement. Most retailers are using AI to re-engage shoppers who abandon carts, sometimes with personalized offers. AI features prominently in earnings calls, with many citing higher investment. Gap is employing AI in product design, e-commerce and daily workflows, freeing creative talent to focus on other tasks. Macy’s is harnessing AI to sharpen customer targeting, optimize planning and enhance its supply chain, cutting costs and delivery times. G-III is following suit, using AI to drive speed and efficiency. (11/17/25) Commentary on Technology Spending Styles, Collaborations Spur Full-Price Spending Brands like Gap, Levi's and Victoria's Secret are using fresh styles and buzzworthy collaborations -- including Gap x Sandy Liang, Levi's x Kiko Kostadinov and Pink x LoveShackFancy -- to drive wardrobe refreshes and full-price sales that lift margins. Department stores are following suit. Macy's debuted its first On 34th x Alix Friedberg partnership, while Dillard's continues to spotlight designer tie-ups such as Antonio Melani x Bungalow Style. Spring/summer 2026 lineups -- from flowy balloon pants and sheer layers to tailored cropped jackets and dress-over-trouser looks -- could reignite sales and help retailers curb discounting. Department stores improving merchandising with more relevant brands, exclusive lines and stronger service may also slow the pace of markdowns.

Given rate of change concerns mentioned above, we know valuation can be much more a driver of downside to the stock than fundamentals.

One of their advantages is that the brand portfolio is exclusively sold through ATZ (no wholesale agreements), giving them better control over product and pricing - contributing to their industry leading margins.

During their most recent Analyst Day in 2022, management highlighted several key margin drivers, including 1) Geo mix shifts: profitability margins in the United States are higher than Canada, 2) Channel mix shifts: profitability margins in eComm are higher than retail, and 3) ATZ has focused on a multi-year IMU improvement initiative with cost efficiencies and selective price actions. From 2022 to today, as US revenue mix has grown to ~55% and eComm mix has stabilized around ~35% - which have both contributed to ATZ's recent margin expansion (with GM hitting 43% in FY25, near the post-pandemic peaks). Additionally, ATZ benefits from their in-house products and brands, and in their latest FY25 earnings call management highlighted IMU improvements, lower markdowns, lower warehousing costs, and tailwinds from store occupancy costs. Looking forward at GMs with material tariff pressure now setting in, we balance the impact of tariffs and the end of the de minimus exemption with the higher cost of ATZ's elevated products and where IMU can go from here. Digging into recent regulatory changes deeper - ATZ was impacted by the closure of de minimis exemptions as they had previously utilized them to ship smaller packages from Canada into the US at a reduced tariff - though management has taken steps to mitigate the impact of de minimis changes by shifting their supply chain towards the US with the relocation of all US order fulfillment to their distribution center in Ohio, which was recently expanded to operate at 3x its prior capacity, allowing ATZ to handle US order volumes for the next two years. 14 | Equity Research Aritzia, Inc.

Moving to today, with tariff rates now higher vs. May, the expected impact has been revised up by management (to 400bps in 3Q26, estimate similar in 4Q26), while in the most recent 2Q call ATZ highlighted that they expect China sourcing to come down materially to just ~LSD or lower for Spring 2026.

While ATZ is set to see tariff headwinds for the next several quarters, their absolute margins should remain in decent shape compared to peers - with 2H GMs planned flat. Despite the impact of tariffs, we still estimate that FY26 GM will expand 170bps to 44.8% (implying core GM expansion of ~395bps), and estimate FY27 will expand another 40bps (core +180bps) as ATZ successfully offsets a significant portion of headwinds and continues to drive margin through 1) IMU improvements, 2) store occupancy leverage, 3) lower warehousing costs, and 4) improved markdowns.

Following the significant investment in FY24 (which was compounded by a revenue slowdown off of product mis-execution), FY25 should see only a modest deleverage of ~20bps as ATZ ramped their smart spending initiative and leveraged fixed costs - some of which was offset by continued investments in digital marketing. That said, we view ATZ's continued investments in the business as prudent and accretive to revenue - as boutique, distribution, and marketing expansion have clearly driven ATZ's market share gains as reviewed above - and management has highlighted they continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiencies and savings, contributing to our estimates of modest SG&A leverage in FY26/27 (on top of fixed cost leverage).

Equity Research Margins vs. Competitors Putting GM and SG&A trends together, as ATZ rapidly expanded their GM profile, their EBIT margin has climbed meaningfully from FY16 to FY22 - peaking at 17.5% (well above other industry peers). Following their FY22 high however, margins quickly compressed and hit an 8% trough in FY24 as product assortment missteps led to sales underperformance and an uptick in promotions - while ATZ continued to invest in their tech and distribution capabilities. However, in their most recent fiscal year, ATZ margins largely rebounded back to 12.5% as investments to support top-line growth have leveled off while GM rebounded following FY24's elevated promotional levels. Looking to FY26 (CY25), we estimate GM will leverage 170bps and SG&A will leverage 65bps, yielding EBIT margin expansion of 235bps to 14.9% - placing them solidly above their top competitors and back towards the higher-end of their historical performance.

We found a total of 15 companies that fit our growth parameters and organized their periods of outsized growth with corresponding valuation rates by 4 groupings of time periods from 1996 to today, seen in the exhibit below. Given ATZ's multiple expansion off of its recent accelerated growth this FY and the contraction we have historically seen in the sector when said growth slows, we analyzed these names within our retail universe to determine what the downside risk could be if ATZ's growth significantly decelerated by comparing the front end valuations of their expansion period (the period of top-line growth acceleration) vs. the back end (the period of top-line deceleration). For both the front and back end, in our exhibit below we present the minimum, maximum and median P/Es during each name's respective period. As seen below, when aggregating all the growth periods, we see that retail names averaged a 28x max multiple during the front end of the expansion period and then on average contracted 12 turns to a 16x max multiple during their deceleration period.

Given this risk, we balance our expectations by basing our $110 CA price target on ~32x FY27 EPS of $3.42, which is slightly below the Street at $3.50 off of lower margin expectations as we see 1) moderate promo risk off an uncertain consumer demand environment, and 2) moderate risk of higher-than-expected investment and expense needs as ATZ continues to build their distribution network and expand their online platforms.

Additionally, when we consider the historical multiple contraction we have seen in the space when a high growth name decelerates, we set our Bear Case at 20x a reduced FY27 EPS of $3.25, or $65. On the other hand, if ATZ is able to comp the comp and continues to see robust growth with strong margin gains, we see a Bull Case of $130, or 35x FY27 EPS of $3.75.

A growing part of LULU's business is its men's and “outside of the gym” product. 2 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc. Equity Research Sales Trends Lackluster in the US While LULU's back at historical % of newness (called ""encouraging"" in 1Q25, and LULU did see growth in its premium segment and grew new guests from an AOV and UPT perspective), we believe both store traffic and CC data (plus competition), suggest no change in full-price US trajectory vs. 1Q. Relative to that, our store-level CC data decelerated (400)bps in 2Q25 vs 1Q. While reads are a bit better in the first three weeks of July, we'd note that 1) LULU's SKU count has increased significantly YoY (we discuss this in more detail below) and 2) is similar YoY in terms of markdown-level %. In other words, a larger total number of SKUs on promo, potentially suggesting reaction to the combination of promos and an increased inventory count. While promo data early in the quarter was favorable YoY, we'd note a large build in WoW data in May and early June, the largest bump in total SKU count during the quarter.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250811_Wells_Fargo_LULU_LULU-_Numbers_Taking_Another_Leg-ging-_Down-_Cutting_Est.pdf

In 1Q25, LULU saw a 10bp tailwind in 1Q on markdowns...but guided for pressure to build in 2Q. The issue seemed US based, with LULU noting ongoing promotional activity across the market and competitors. Another key line item from 1Q25, ending inventories grew +23% YoY, but management emphasized inventories were clean, with growth more macro related (i.e, buying in front of tariffs). With all that said, clearance has picked up meaningfully in July. While we don’t believe this is totally unplanned (as mgmt spoke to a need to accelerate markdowns as 2Q progressed on their last call), it speaks to their ongoing execution issues, as they need to clear color palettes that didn’t work earlier this year. That said, the lack of improvement in full-price US trend makes us think markdowns could remain problematic in 2H. The YoY change in ""We Made Too Much,"" as a % of total SKUs, inflected negative for the first time since May 2024. Over the past few weeks in July, the % of We Made Too Much is up approx 100bps to 200bps YoY. This metric had consistently declined YoY for 12+ months. That said, we believe the step-up in clearance fits with 1Q commentary on increased promo levels in 2Q, though potentially consolidated into a few weeks here at the end of the quarter. On a positive note, the total # of WMTM SKUs is down 2% WoW. ...Unsure About Growth in SKU Count Another risk here is SKU count, which grew to 2,581 in 2Q (or +46% YoY). While SKU count ebbs and flows at LULU the step-up, starting around May, is outside historical ranges. While it is certainly possible the step-up in SKU count is predicated on clearance, we believe it is worth a call-out, especially as the We Made Too Much % has ticked up in recent weeks. At the least, we believe it merits watching.

We likewise heard some concerning details on LULU's China direction from our latest China Sportswear Expert Call (""State of Retail"" Expert Series: James Wong, China Sportswear and Footwear Operator). If LULU's high margin China region shows any material holes, it would clearly drive greater margin risk go-fwd (highest segment GMs and incremental margins). From a top-down perspective, general trends in China sportswear/athletics appears more mixed of late (ex 2) and overall consumer commentary is negative. News reports suggest the PBOC survey of consumer sentiment worsened further in the April - June 2Q survey with respondents ""increasingly negative about income, employment and price..."" Views on the jobs market fell to the worst reading ever and reports argue that recent sales growth in China was based on government subsidies, not improving consumer sentiment. Concerns on discretionary income and price are potentially significant given recent checks. Feedback from our recent expert checks shared similar concerns that LULU's growth, specifically, could slow from the move to Tier 2 cities given premium product and elevated pricing. Our checks likened the situation to the footwear environment, similar to Anta and Li Ning vs. NKE and ADS over the past several years. We believe LULU has a growing set of competitors abroad, including Maia Active (owned by Anta) along with NKE, ADS, and recently, Alo. Feedback suggests Maia is ~50% cheaper than LULU with ""similar"" quality, and is the local brand. We believe LULU is potentially having to move outside pure yoga from an engagement perspective as it works to take share. Bigger picture, while LULU is certainly not Louis Vuitton or Porsche, each recently reported a sharp drop in YoY sales, as the higher- end customer is pulling back. 4 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc.

Tariffs were the key driver to the downside, causing the majority of the ~50bp revision to GM/OM. Post 1Q, the Trump administration announced an agreement with Vietnam on finalized trade and tariff details. The trade deal includes a 20% US tariff on Vietnamese goods, as well as a 40% “transshipping” tariff. We acknowledge that questions remain, including when the deal would take effect and whether the agreement is signed—Vietnam Briefing said in a 7/7 article that the two sides ""have agreed in principle to a framework trade deal."" Another point of uncertainty is the issue of transshipment volumes and values given the 2x unmitigated rate (40% vs. 20%) vs. direct imports from Vietnam. That said, we believe LULU is one of the most exposed companies in our coverage universe to Vietnam sourcing and our work indicates between 50 to 100bps of additional GM headwind on an annualized basis. This adds another layer of risk when considering the go-forward outlook management will offer when the company reports.

Relative to 2Q and FY guide, the commentary implies a material step down in spend in 2H (from ~150bps deleverage in 1H to ~75bps leverage in 2H). The concern here, especially against a backdrop of macro and micro pressures, is a potential need to accelerate demand generation. Our checks have confirmed a higher proportion of spend at Alo, on the higher end of the domestic market, and price and brand affinity risks in China.

LULU's business in NA has been one of the strongest and most consistent in the softlines space over the past 10+ years—with comps averaging 10-15% over that time as the brand took share in a rapidly growing ""athleisure"" space. However, the brand is in unchartered waters today, unable to comp positive in 12+ months with the US market negative and struggling due to a lack of innovation on core product and increasing competition from new entrants (namely Alo Yoga and Vuori, as well as others). As their highest margin geography, the lack of comp visibility is creating a clear issue for the story.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250811_Wells_Fargo_LULU_LULU-_Numbers_Taking_Another_Leg-ging-_Down-_Cutting_Est.pdf

Emerging Competition. While competition concerns have always surrounded LULU, there are",17,6,10,"signs that emerging brands are perhaps eating into LULU's dominant position in athleisure. Vuori is a brand that is beginning to take real market share from LULU in regions such as Southern California (where Vuori is headquartered). Notably many LULU alums have joined Vuori in the past several years, driven by: 1) the changing culture at LULU and 2) a similar ethos to when LULU was in its early days. Others competitors such as Alo Yoga also appear to catering to a more fashion- focused consumer and gaining share. Further, the increased competition may force LULU to begin 6 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc. Equity Research spending heavier on marketing, which could weigh on margins—notably LULU's marketing spend as a % of sales (4-5%) is one of the lowest among brands in our coverage (avg. 8-10%). Equity Research | 7 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on LULU shares. Exhibit 10 - The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Source: © iStockphoto.com The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on LULU shares are focused on: (1) LULU had been one of the better comping brands in retail with a dominant position in their industry, (2) international growth (led by MLC) should enable LULU to continue hitting their top-line algo despite robust multi-year growth, (3) worries of a material slowdown in NA are overblown; and (4) valuation is at all-time lows and creates a compelling risk/reward. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on LULU shares are likely focused on: (1) their core NA market has underperformed for 12+ months with no signs of stabilization ahead (which will weigh on LULU's industry-leading margins); (2) inventory has become an issue with 20%+ growth exiting 1Q, (3) the business pushes into international markets with higher operating costs, and investors question the trajectory of markdowns go-forward; and (4) should competition remain strong, this could pressure margins if LULU needed to ramp their industry-low demand creation dollars (marketing spend). 8 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc. Equity Research Financial Outlook FY25E Our FY25E EPS estimate of $14.60 represents essentially flat EPS YoY. We project net sales up 5% on comps up 2.5% and +HSD footage growth. We expect GMs to contract 100bps to 58.2% and SG&A % to de-lever 65bps, resulting in an operating margin of ~22%, down 165bps y/y.

(LULU) Investment Thesis LULU is an industry leader in an attractive market (athletic apparel). We believe the company has ample white space overseas and will continue to post outsized international growth. However, the slowdown in North America along with an ""over earning"" P&L are a concern and keep us cautious over the next 12 months. We are Equal Weight rated. Target Price Valuation for LULU: $225.00 from $270.00 Our $225 price target reflects a 15x FY26E P/E. We believe a discount to history is warranted given that LULU is dealing with merchandising issues domestically, while operating at record margins as competition around them is heating up while US comps are trending negative. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for LULU Upside risks (1) SSS accelerate; (2) North America slowdown is not as drastic as expected, and (3) international growth (particulary in China) is better than expected.

WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.

The new, and incremental, tariff regime, BCI, US initially expected to go into effect August 1st has been delayed until August 7th. Furthermore, there is a grace period for goods shipped before August 7th and entering the United States before October 5th, 2025. These goods will not be subject to the new, higher tariff rates, but rather the pre-existing rates and will avoid the new duties. As such, for the majority of US retailers with a year-end December or January, there is unlikely to be much impact to CY25 with the incremental pressure beginning 1H26. 2Q25 Promo Score 53/100 remains ""Flat;"" Stick with names with either brand heat or strong value proposition (Off-Price). The 2Q25 Promo Score is 53 out of 100, similar to the 52 out of 100 in 1Q25. We are seeing a clear bifurcation of in-demand, desirable brands with pricing power versus those relying on promos to drive traffic. As such, we continue to recommend names with brand heat and sales momentum even if relative valuations are more expensive (e.g., DKS, RL, ONON, TPR) or a strong value proposition such as Off-Price (e.g., BURL, TJX, ROST). Sales before margins. We almost always say that companies see margin impact before sales impact in both positive and negative inflections in the retail cycle. There are three main types of shock events to a retail P&L: 1) demand/sales shock, 2) supply/inventory shock, and the lesser- Barclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

Both sales and inventory shocks typically result in a ""margins before sales"" recovery, where cleaning up inventory is Phase 1 and returning to positive comps is Phase 2. However, in an input cost shock, we see sales before margins. We expect to see positive sales growth in 2H25 as companies increase prices (giving potentially false hope to investors), but expect margins to be the X-factor where companies will miss consensus expectations, with particular risk to 4Q25. Focus on inventory dollars, not units. The US Retail sector sales-to-inventory spread was worsening before tariffs entering FY25. So it is no surprise we see material margin and EPS risk in 2H25, only worsened by tariff costs. We expect sales-to-inventory spreads to materially worsen as we focus on dollar inventory growth not units. Positive on TPR, ULTA, URBN, VSCO. TPR (Figure 46) promos remained ""Better"" as all of their respective brands. ULTA (Figure 53) improved from ""Flat-to-Deeper"" to ""Flat-to-Better,"" as the beauty category shows signs of stabilization. URBN posted ""Better"" promos for its namesake UO brand for the second consecutive quarter (Figure 58), indicating that the UO turnaround is sustained. VSCO maintained its ""Better"" score of 68/100 (Figure 64), with Pink apparel improving and new VS bra launches beginning to hit for fall. Cautious on LULU, GAP. In 2Q25, at LULU (Figure 42) we noted an inflection from ""Flat to ""Deeper"" score for the ""We Made Too Much"" section of LULU's website, with 2Q25 running deeper for the entirety of the quarter. Average WMTM units increased 44% y/y in 2Q25 from +3% in 1Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion. GAP (Figure 34 - Figure 38) saw its consolidated score negatively impacted by Gap brand inflecting from ""Flat"" to ""Deeper"" and Athleta worsening and still ""Deeper"". Increasing ULTA and URBN estimates and PT. We raise our earnings, PT, and multiples driven by our fundamental promotional checks.

In our view, both GAP and LULU saw an increase in the use of promos, implying traffic challenges.

Within the Coach Full-Line concept, promo activity was exceptionally clean with a nearly perfect score of 96/100, earning a ""Better"" rating. Notably, Coach Outlet received a ""Better"" rating for the third consecutive time, with a perfect Promo Score of 100/100. Kate Spade's promo activity improved, coming in at ""Flat-to-Better,"" with a Promo Score of 65/100 and approaching an inflection to positive. ULTA: EW (Flat-to-Better, Promo Score 62/100): In FY2Q25, ULTA posted a score of ""Flat-to- Better"" with a 62/100 marking its highest score since FY3Q20. Promotional activity was notably cleaner early in the quarter with strong promotional restraint in the earlier part of the quarter. The overall lower activity reflects a meaningful shift toward more disciplined promotional execution. After many quarters of softness in the beauty category, we believe the beauty segment is stabilizing. URBN: OW (Flat, Promo Score 55/100): URBN posted a FY2Q25 consolidated Promo Score of 55/100 for the second consecutive quarter, maintaining its ""Flat"" rating. Consolidated performance continues to be led by the Urban Outfitters brand, which posted a ""Better"" score of 77/100. It was UO's second consecutive quarter with a ""Better"" score, a clear sign that the turnaround is being sustained. Free People also improved, posting another ""Flat"" score at 50/100 from 39/100 last quarter. After last year's very clean quarter, Anthropologie recorded a ""Flat-to-Deeper"" score of 35/100, down from 43/100 in 1Q25. All three brands are trend- and target-right and we believe set up well for BTS/holiday. VSCO: OW (Better, Promo Score 68/100). VSCO posted a 2Q25 consolidated Promo Score of 68/100 with both brands with much cleaner clearance carryover and Pink posting 73/100 similar to last quarter and VS 65/100 also similar to last quarter. We note Pink's apparel business in recovery, VS new bra launches, and collaborations with such brands as Love Shack Fancy all driving improved brand resonance with customers. Cautious Callouts: GAP: OW (Flat-to-Deeper, Promo Score 37/100): GAP posted a consolidated Promo Score of 37/100 in FY2Q25, down from 47/100 last quarter. The decline was driven by a pullback at the Gap brand, which fell to 27/100 from 58/100, reversing prior progress. Old Navy also softened slightly to 42/100 from 50/100. Banana Republic was the lone bright spot, improving to 69/100 from 46/100, suggesting traction in its premium repositioning. Athleta remains deeply promotional, recording a score of 4/100, down from 8/100, and marking the brand's fifth consecutive quarter running ""Deeper"" promotions. LULU: EW (Deeper, Promo Score 0/100): LULU recorded a Promo Score of 0/100 in FY2Q25, down sharply from 46/100 last quarter, marking its most promotional quarter in recent history. Recall, we measure the promo levels in the ""We Made Too Much"" (WMTM) clearance section, and note that during FY2Q25 this section saw a notable increase in depth and frequency of for the duration of the quarter. Average WMTM units increased 44% y/y in 2Q25 from +3% in 1Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion. The sharp inflection in WMTM activity raises questions about inventory management and full- price sell-through, particularly as the brand navigates challenges in its U.S. stores amidst a more competitive and value-sensitive consumer environment. 6 August 2025 6 Barclays | U.S. Retail",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250812_Barclays_ULTA_U.S._Retail-_2Q25_Preview_-_Promo_Tracker-_Positive_TPR-.pdf

This allows us to quantify the magnitude of each company’s own year-over-year promotional depth, while also providing us with a way to measure the company’s performance relative to peers. The scoring system is as follows: For each week: A rating of ""Better"" = +1.0 A rating of ""Flat"" = 0.0 A rating of ""Deeper"" = -1.0 For each division: The values for each week are then summed in order to give an overall promotional score for the quarter. Given that the retail calendar quarters consist of 13 full weeks, the range of possible scores is from -13 to +13. (Note, the first and last weekly data points are half a weekend each.) For companies with multiple divisions: The weighted average of the corresponding divisions is taken in order to calculate an overall company score. The last reported percentage of total sales for each division is utilized as a baseline in order to weight the individual division’s scores. Rating legend for each company: ""Better"" (~ top third) ≥ +4.34 ""Flat/B"" ≥ +2.0 and < +4.33 ""Flat"" > -2.0 and < +2.0 ""Flat/D"" > -4.33 and ≤ -2.0 ""Deeper"" (~ bottom third) ≤ -4.34 6 August 2025 12 Barclays | U.S. Retail",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250812_Barclays_ULTA_U.S._Retail-_2Q25_Preview_-_Promo_Tracker-_Positive_TPR-.pdf

The Promo Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). One should think of the score as the percent of the time that the company was in line with or better (less promotional) than the prior year. For example, a score of 85 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for 85% of the quarter, whereas a score of 15 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for only 15% of the quarter. As a reminder, scores of 0 to 33 are considered “Deeper”; 34 to 67 are considered “Flat”; and 67 to 100 are considered “Better” YoY.

The Promo Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). One should think of the score as the percent of the time that the company was in line with or better (less promotional) than the prior year. For example, a score of 85 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for 85% of the quarter, whereas a score of 15 suggests that the company was as-or-less-promotional versus last year for only 15% of the quarter. As a reminder, scores of 0 to 33 are considered “Deeper”; 34 to 67 are considered “Flat”; and 67 to 100 are considered “Better” YoY. We use this analysis as a proxy for the direction of merchandise margin. FIGURE 64.

Our proprietary promotion tracker is intended to provide a quarterly snapshot of the promotional environment seen throughout the quarter across our sector, as well as for individual companies. We analyze the “headline,” or main promotions – including online, email, and in-store – each weekend, giving us a national- to-regional-to-local snapshot of promotional activity. We recognize that this process does not fully incorporate the amount or level of markdown/clearance inventory chain-wide, but we believe that material changes in year-over-year “headline” promotions can be used as an indicator of a company’s performance versus last year (and potential merchandise margin impact). For each company, we evaluate the weekly promotion compare between “This Year” and “Last Year” and determine whether it is “Better,” “Flat,” or “Deeper” versus last year. Based on our consolidated weekly assessments, each company under coverage is then given an overall rating for the quarter of “Better,” “Flat,” or “Deeper.” We publish a quarterly report that is best used to identify upside outliers, as opposed to downside outliers; we believe retailers who are less promotional may be running ahead of plan, but deeper promotions could already be incorporated in a company’s plan or used to proactively prevent clearance from building. We use the results of the Promo Tracker Report to identify companies that are less promotional, or “Better,” year-over-year, suggesting that the business may be running above plan. However, “Deeper” promotions could have already been accounted for in guidance or a retailer could be moving product at full-price/first markdown, rather than waiting to clear it as margin-eroding markdowns. As such, a “Deeper” cadence is not necessarily indicative of a “missed” quarter, but we do believe lightening up on promotions could be a signal of upside to the quarter. Promo Scorecard Promo Tracker. We are publishing the most recent installment of our proprietary promotional analysis, The Promo Tracker. This is a quarterly analysis of YoY “headline” (or front-of-store promos) that we use as: 1) an indication that “clean” inventory levels are resulting in fewer promos (and therefore higher average unit retail), and 2) a proxy for merchandise margin direction (i.e., fewer promos = positive merchandise margin impact; more promos = negative merchandise margin impact). A historical bar chart of each quarter depicts the percent of the quarter a company spent running Better, Flat, or Deeper promos. If a retailer has greater than 50% of the quarter either Better or Deeper YoY, we deem that to be a statistical outlier and material callout. Promo Tracker Score out of 100. We quantify our weekly ratings as follows: 100 points for “Better;” 50 points for “Flat;” and 0 points for “Deeper.” We then use a weighted average based on the frequency of occurrences during each of the quarters since we began analyzing YoY headline promotions across the sector. As a result, promo scores <34 points are “Deeper,” promo scores between 34 and 67 points are “Flat,” and promo scores >67 points are “Better.” Merchandise margin proxy. As a reminder, this report is a directional indicator of merchandise margin based on our proprietary checks. We point out that other factors may dictate stock reaction to the quarter results, most notably comp upside/downside. Thus, a retailer running more promos may successfully “buy” the comp, yet a retailer pulling back on promos may see comp deceleration. 6 August 2025 45 Barclays | U.S. Retail We use the following metrics to assess a retailer’s promotional activity: Historical Cadence Chart: Percent of Quarter Deeper, Flat, or Better on Promos YoY. We analyze headline promotions weekly and use this metric as proxy for the direction of merchandise margin performance. Absolute Promo Score. This is our final score on a scale from 0 to 100 (worst to best). We look at a company’s historical promotional score to see if their promo activity is improving or deteriorating on an absolute basis. Scores below 33 are “Deeper;” scores between 34 and 67 are “Flat,” and scores above 67 are “Better.” 6 August 2025 46 Barclays | U.S. Retail Subgroup Constituents Specialty Softlines This subgroup consists of the following eleven stocks: AEO, ANF, CPRI, GAP, GOOS, GRGD, KSS, LULU, M, TPR, URBN, VSCO.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated.

The ""de minimis exemption"" is/was a long-standing U.S. customs policy that allowed low-value international shipments—typically under $800—to 1) enter the country duty-free and 2) do so with minimal customs paperwork.

Shipping (Individual),12,3,3,"Packages are shipped via small parcel carries (like DHL, FedEx, UPS) across the US-Mexico border. Because the handbag costs less than $800, the package qualified for the Section 321 de minimis exemption. That means no import duties or tariffs were paid. In the case of TPR, the prior 0% duties/ tariffs will now move much higher to 30%+ based on the blended average on what they are paying to bring goods into the US. Ending the De Minimis Exemption - 2025 Timeline of Events • April 2, 2025: As part of tariffs announced on ""Liberation Day,"" President Trump signed an executive order closing the exemption for shipments from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, 2025. • July 4, 2025: President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which legally repealed the exemption altogether—set to take effect on July 1, 2027. • July 30, 2025: Using emergency executive powers, President Trump accelerated the end of the exemption for all countries, bringing it forward to August 29, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT. • For China and Hong Kong specifically, it had already ended earlier on May 2, 2025. The Abrupt Shift In Policy Makes the Issue More Topical The timing of the announcements is the key factor here. While companies who were utilizing the exemption were preparing to phase it out over the next 1-2 years, we believe the abrupt change in the deadline has caused some near-term issues as some companies update guidance. This was the case with TPR just last week. Essentially, TPR did not discuss its de minimis exposure previously as the deadline was 2+ years on the horizon and thus not material. How Did This Affect TPR? While investors were not very aware that TPR had been benefiting from it, the elimination of de minimis will cause pressure on the margins within their US e-commerce business starting on August",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250826_Wells_Fargo_LULU_LULU-_Cutting_Numbers_-Again-_as_De_Minimis_Headwind_Cre.pdf

TPR has a sizable US business (~60% of geographic revs) and fairly high ecommerce mix (at 30%).,13,3,4,"By utilizing DCs located in Mexico, TPR had been able to ship product to their Mexican DCs—which was then re-routed to US parcel services, thus avoiding duties. Mexico and Canada have been the most commonly used countries for exploiting the loophole due to proximity to the US. Based on our analysis, we believe TPR was generating 40-45% of US ecomm revs via de minimis. The issue is while prior duties had been 0% under de minimis, this now jumps to 30%+ (a fully stacked tariff). We estimate their DM headwind to be $50-55M range (1/3rd of their total tariff headwind of $160M). TPR noted that approximately 1/3 of its newly-updated ""tariff impact"" (or $0.20 of $0.60 Equity Research | 3 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research headwind) stemmed from the change to de minimis regulation.

To start—we acknowledge a lot of ""known unknowns"" as it relates to LULU's de minimis usage. That said, as we have dug around our space looking to see if any other companies have benefited from DM over the past several years without investors knowing, we believe LULU falls in the same bucket that TPR does. To that point, we recently spoke with a few industry contacts/former employees to better understand the issue. While we didn't get a direct read on LULU's absolute de minimis exposure (not clear how much US ecomm it captures), our checks did confirm that LULU utilizes the exception. One important point is that LULU was already heavily leveraged to Canadian distribution given their heritage, potentially exacerbating the issue of de minimis exposure (much easier for them to lean into the loophole vs. others). Of note, approximately 1/3 of LULU's NA DC square footage is located in Canada. While we don't have exact numbers, one contact did state they believe LULU's DM exposure is likely outsized vs. others given the Canada DC network. We Expect Guidance Needs to Be Cut 4 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc. Equity Research We use the analysis above as our framework for assessing LULU's potential impact, but would note that our checks pointed to a potential for an outsized impact on LULU, and thus adjust up its de minimis exposure vs. TPR, relative to total Ecomm COGS.

See Exhibits 2 and 3. Regarding the quarters based on the timelines in place today, with the exemption expected to sunset at the end of August, we believe the policy change could impact about 2/3 of LULU's 3Q25 (Aug-Oct) and would have a full impact on 4Q25. Making the assumption that % of sales by quarter is a proxy for how the impact hits the P&L, and given the timing of implementation, we'd see about a $0.15-$0.20 impact to 3Q and a $0.30-$0.35 impact to 4Q. Our FY26 EPS comes down by the full $1.00 estimate (essentially the MP of our $0.90 to $1.08 range). We cut our 2H25 EPS and bring 2025 lower to $14.15 (from $14.60 prior) vs. Street $14.48.

Slowing Trends in North America Creating Concern. Investors continue to focus on the,22,5,6,"slowdown in North America (NA).

However, the brand is in unchartered waters today, unable to comp positive in 12+ months with the US market negative and struggling due to a lack of innovation on core product and increasing competition from new entrants (namely Alo Yoga and Vuori, as well as others).

Emerging Competition. While competition concerns have always surrounded LULU, there are",24,6,9,"signs that emerging brands are perhaps eating into LULU's dominant position in athleisure. Vuori is a brand that is beginning to take real market share from LULU in regions such as Southern California (where Vuori is headquartered). Notably many LULU alums have joined Vuori in the past several years, driven by: 1) the changing culture at LULU and 2) a similar ethos to when LULU was in its early days. Others competitors such as Alo Yoga also appear to catering to a more fashion- focused consumer and gaining share. Further, the increased competition may force LULU to begin spending heavier on marketing, which could weigh on margins—notably LULU's marketing spend as a % of sales (4-5%) is one of the lowest among brands in our coverage (avg. 8-10%). 6 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc. Equity Research The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on LULU shares. Exhibit 4 - The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Source: © iStockphoto.com The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on LULU shares are focused on: (1) LULU had been one of the better comping brands in retail with a dominant position in their industry, (2) international growth (led by MLC) should enable LULU to continue hitting their top-line algo despite robust multi-year growth, (3) worries of a material slowdown in NA are overblown; and (4) valuation is at all-time lows and creates a compelling risk/reward. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on LULU shares are likely focused on: (1) their core NA market has underperformed for 12+ months with no signs of stabilization ahead (which will weigh on LULU's industry-leading margins); (2) inventory has become an issue with 20%+ growth exiting 1Q, (3) the business pushes into international markets with higher operating costs, and investors question the trajectory of markdowns go-forward; and (4) should competition remain strong, this could pressure margins if LULU needed to ramp their industry-low demand creation dollars (marketing spend).

WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.

Contributing Analysts Abigail Gilmartin (Retail) Footwear and Athleisure companies' greater production exposure to South Asian countries, particularly Vietnam, put their margins at risk given the addition of tariffs higher than the 10% pause rate. Though companies may be able to mitigate some of the risk via price increases and supplier negotiations, higher costs appear unavoidable and will likely still be a drag to margins. Nike sources about 50% of its footwear from Vietnam and On over 90%. Steve Madden, HeyDude and Skechers, which source more than 40% from China, face greater risks, though they're likely able to quickly adjust their supply chains. Ending the de minimis exemption for China levels the playing field by targeting low-cost Chinese sellers like Temu and Shein, which might have to raise prices. Bulk shipping via PDD and Alibaba could offset some costs. (08/01/25)",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250904_Lululemon-s_Increased_Tariff_Pains_Result_in_Guidance_Cut-_React.pdf

That's even with higher prices and shifts in production or sourcing. Exposure to other countries is mostly lower across our coverage. Retailers like Best Buy have less direct control than manufacturers over inventory sourced from China or other countries.

These retailers source 27-36% of their US receipts from Vietnam, the top such hub for most apparel retailers since a shift away from China when duties were implemented in 2019. Gap indicated it plans to reduce its Vietnam sourcing to no more than 25% by year-end. Aritzia said a 20% tariff would pare margins by 30 bps for the rest of 2025 (about 45 bps annualized, based on our analysis). DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld parent G-III, which sources 36% from Vietnam, faces an additional hit of 90 bps.

Our analysis suggests additional mid-single-digit US price hikes may be sufficient to offset the levies. In contrast, the likes of Burberry, Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Pandora and Zegna are leaning on cost cuts as a partial offset. A few peers, including Swiss watchmakers Richemont, Rolex and Swatch, face steeper tariffs and may rely on suppliers and wholesalers for support, though only top-end brand ranges look able to pull off double-digit US price hikes.

Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing.

P/E 14.0x 14.5x 13.8x But it may also be a sign that U.S. consumers are re-gravitating to the brand following a few choppy quarters. International Google search trends are also encouraging, particularly considering that the rapid slowdown in International growth in Q1 contributed to the sharply negative stock reaction on the day of earnings. Almost every major International market for LULU (in both EMEA and Asia) saw stronger online search growth in Q2 than Q1, so we could also see a re-acceleration in International growth in Q2. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 8 OF THIS REPORT. August 29, 2025 At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS The operating environment has become more challenging, but we believe LULU is a strong brand with long-term growth drivers and potential for a product-driven re-acceleration domestically. BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS In our bull case we assume that they We're modeling FY25 slightly below In our bear case, we assume FY25 comes ""right the ship"" in the U.S. and the current EPS guidance. Next year, in even worse than our below-guidance macro environment doesn't deteriorate we expect LSD comp growth, with estimate, and generates just flat comp any further, leading to a FY25 earnings some footage growth resulting in MSD growth next year (negative in North beat and a faster re-acceleration of consolidated revenue growth. We assume America and positive overseas). Amid revenues in FY26. In this scenario, we think margins decline slightly due to the wrap- slowing sales, we assume discounting FY26 EPS power could be ~$16.00. At a around of tariffs, resulting in FY26 EPS increases, and the company experiences high-teens P/E multiple, the stock would power of $14.75-$15.00. Our price target of ~100bps of EBIT margin erosion next year. be ~$300. $238 is based on a 16x P/E on our FY26 EPS In this scenario, FY26 EPS declines to ~ estimate of $14.86. $13.50. At a low-teens P/E multiple, the stock could fall to ~$175. COMPANY DESCRIPTION LULU is a women's focused athleisure brand headquartered in Vancouver, Canada.

In recent weeks, we have seen a meaningful increase in the number of items available on the ""Made Too Much"" section of the website. In late-Winter/early-Spring, the number of SKUs in this section was hovering in the 775-800 range. However, it began steadily climbing in late-April, and as of last weekend there are now more than 1,100 items for sale on Lululemon.com. Though we unfortunately do not have YoY figures (since we joined Needham less than a year ago and began our tracking in October 2024), we believe this is an elevated level of discounting. To frame it up, in the post-Holiday clearance period early-January, the website peaked at 1,027 clearance SKUs. Thus, the total number of discounted SKUs is currently higher than it was during the traditional post-Holiday clearance period in January.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250908_Needham_LULU_We_See_Gross_Margin_Risk_As_-Made_Too_Much-_Product_Grow.pdf

Admittedly, when the company reported Q1 results in early-June, they did call for a ""modest increase"" in markdowns in Q2 and for the FY. However, given the rapid rise in ""Made Too Much"" product on the website, we do think it's possible that the level of markdowns was more intense than management expected. As a result, we've lowered our Q2 gross margin estimate slightly (to -220bps vs. guidance -200bps) and our 2H gross margin forecast by 50bps. As a result, we now forecast 140bps of gross margin pressure for FY25 (vs. 110bps of erosion previously). This drives our Q2 and FY EPS estimates below guidance: we now forecast Q2 EPS of $2.84 (vs. guidance $2.85-$2.90) and our FY estimate moves down to $14.12 (vs. guidance $14.58-$14.78). Figure 2 - Lower Gross Margin Forecasts Have Taken Our EPS Estimates Lower Source: Needham & Co. estimates Lululemon Athletica, Inc. / 3 August 29, 2025 RE-ACCELERATION OF ONLINE SEARCH TRENDS COULD BE A POSITIVE SIGN Last year, when LULU's U.S. business experienced a meaningful slowdown, we saw a concurrent deceleration in online search trends, reflective of waning brand heat. Between April 2024 and February 2025, YoY searches for Lululemon on Google (U.S. only) were negative YoY in 9 of the 11 months, with the only positive month being December (which corresponded with a strong Holiday season for the brand) . Encouragingly, Google searches for Lululemon in the U.S. have been positive for the past 6 months, and have accelerated to very strong levels during the summer months. Search growth exceeded 20% in June, accelerated further to nearly 35% in July, and is on track for another month of 30%+ growth in August. Perhaps some of this acceleration is driven by consumers seeking discounts (perhaps learning about the discounts via word-of-mouth). But it may also be a sign that U.S. consumers are re-gravitating to the brand following a few choppy quarters. Figure 3 - Online Searches For Lululemon In The U.S. Have Been Strong Of Late Source: Google Trends and Needham & Co. International Google search trends are also encouraging, particularly considering that the rapid slowdown in International growth in Q1 contributed to the sharply negative stock reaction on the day of earnings. Starting with mainland China, Google search trends have usually tracked comp growth fairly well. For example, during FY24, China's quarterly comp growth ranged from +23% to +33%, while Google search growth ranged from 24%-44%. In Q1, when China comps slowed all the way to +8%, Google searches likewise slowed to a similar level (+7%). During Q2, China search trends re-accelerated to +13%, and if China begins comping double-digits again, we think it could improve sentiment in the stock. Additionally, almost every other major market for the Lululemon brand saw accelerating Google search growth in Q2 vs. Q1. The company's 3 largest countries in EMEA (U.K., Germany, and France) all saw stronger search growth in Q2 than Q1, and growth was exceptionally strong in France (searches nearly doubled YoY) and Germany (up almost 80% YoY). In Asia ex-Mainland China, almost every major country saw an acceleration from Q1 to Q2, with the exception of Japan (a slight deceleration to +6% vs. Q1's +7%). Thus, after the ""Rest of World"" segment, which is comprised of EMEA and Asia ex-Mainland China, decelerated rapidly in Q1 (to +7% from +17% in Q4), we think it is possible that the segment could have re-accelerated in Q2.

THE STOCK IS THE CHEAPEST IT'S BEEN IN A LONG TIME LULU shares are down almost 50% YTD (vs. SPX +10%), making it one of the most pressured names in our coverage this year. As a result, shares are trading at ~14x consensus NTM earnings, and a few weeks ago it toughed at ~13x consensus EPS. The last time the stock traded at this low a P/E multiple was during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, when the company was obviously a lot smaller than it is today (and had much less ""proof of concept"" at the time). Ove the past 5 and 10 years, the stock's average P/E has been ~35x, and over the past years it's been ~26x. Obviously, the company has less growth potential today than it did a few years ago, but we still think that a low-teens multiple for a company this high-quality is overly negative.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250908_Needham_LULU_We_See_Gross_Margin_Risk_As_-Made_Too_Much-_Product_Grow.pdf

Neither Moody’s nor Standard & Poor’s has a credit rating on the company. However, LULU has $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, and no debt. LULU’s forward four-quarter price-cash flow is 10.5x compared to the five-year average of 38.1x (five-year high 80.8x, five-year low 10.2x). The industry average from FactSet of 22.1x. The company trades with a trailing four-quarter price/sales ratio of 1.8x compared to the five- year average of 6.6x (five-year high 12.8x, five-year low 1.8x). The industry average from FactSet of 3.3x. LULU’s forward four-quarter P/E is 12.7x compared to the five-year average of 32.6x (five-year high 72.3x, five-year low 12.3x). The industry average from FactSet of 36.8x. In our opinion, LULU deserves to trade at a premium valuation due to its solid growth potential and financial consistency. Investment Thesis We reduced our rating on LULU from BUY to HOLD due to a weaker outlook. Management cut its guidance, despite reporting above- consensus EPS. The lower guidance reflects a $240 million reduction in profit related to the removal of the de minimis exemption, which excludes tariffs on smaller shipments. LULU plans to mitigate tariff impact through expense management, modest price increases, and vendor negotiations. Looking forward, the company plans to improve innovation by introducing new styles to rejuvenate core categories, especially with its loungewear and social segments. LULU also plans to improve supply chain speed to better respond to changing market trends and guest preferences. We believe it could take a few quarters for the company to improve operating performance with better product innovation.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250909_Ameriprise_Advisor_Services-_Inc._LULU_LULU-_LULU_Reduced_to_Hold.pdf

Ameriprise Recommended List equities are equities that our analyst(s) believe offer attractive total return potential within their coverage universe based on current conditions. Your financial advisor can assist you with determining the risk profile of the Recommended List companies within the context of your overall investment portfolio. Additions and deletions are at the discretion of the analyst(s) covering the sector, with changes based upon such fundamental factors as valuation, competitive position, market conditions, etc. The Sector Recommended List is not designed to be a complete portfolio, but instead to assist in the selection of securities for the equity portion of a well-diversified portfolio. We believe it is important for investors to diversify their investments across asset classes, economic sectors and industries in order to help reduce risk. Please consult with your financial advisor to assist in creating a diversified portfolio that is consistent with your investment objectives. Recommended List selections and securities markets in general could experience significant volatility due to several factors, including but not limited to: changes in global economic conditions, movements in interest & foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in commodity prices, geopolitical risks, changes in the regulatory & legislative environment (e.g., regulatory capital requirements, changes in tax rates, Medicare, etc.), catastrophes & natural disasters, labor issues, disruptions in the supply chain, merger integration issues, patent expiration, cybersecurity issues, litigation risks, headline risks, changes in distribution, and the loss of key personnel. For additional information please refer to third party research reports. You may experience a loss of principal by investing in equities. Securities included on our Recommended Lists are selected from the universe of companies covered by AEIS. Approved third party research providers (e.g., CFRA powered by data from S&P Global, Morningstar and Refinitiv/LSEG) generally provide additional information on Recommended List companies. Recommended List selections reflect securities that our analysts believe represent good value based on current conditions. If a security is added to a Recommended List, we deem it to be appropriate for investment. If a security is removed from a Recommended List and you choose to hold the removed security in your investment portfolio, you should continue to review available third party research sources in order to obtain an investment opinion, price target, and additional fundamental analysis. Ameriprise equity ratings definitions Buy Rating – The shares are expected to outperform the analyst’s benchmark (or blended benchmark) over the next 12 months on a total return basis. We believe the company has healthy business prospects and/or attractive valuation metrics that could result in strong performance versus the benchmark. Hold Rating – The common shares are expected to perform in-line with the analyst’s benchmark (or blended benchmark) over the next 12 months on a total return basis. The company has attractive long-term business prospects, but certain near-term issues could result in performance that only matches the benchmark, and shares may be fairly valued at current levels.

The amount of dividend payment, if any, can vary over time and issuers may reduce or eliminate dividends paid on securities in the event of a recession or adverse event affecting a specific industry or issuer.

Standard Deviation (of price): Standard Deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a set of data relative to its mean. When the data points are further away from the mean, there is a greater deviation from the mean and a higher standard deviation.

In addition, mgmt cited the overall market for premium athletic wear in the US remains challenged, with sequential deceleration in the industry growth rate in 2Q led by the consumer, (i) reducing spend across performance activewear and (ii) when motivated to spend, is driven by newness. Breaking down the outlook further by region: • US Stacked Revenue Growth Moderates 430bps: LULU reported a 2Q US revenue decline -0.5% Y/Y (vs. Street Flat), sequentially decelerating -210bps relative to 1Q US revenues +1.7%, despite a ~200bps easier comparison QoQ. On the cadence of the quarter, mgmt noted May as the best month of the quarter with a sequential deceleration month-to-month, w/ July finishing as the softest month of the quarter (despite July’s comparison easier by ~400bps relative to May by our work & in contrast to lateral results across our coverage realizing a +500bps improvement on average in July vs. May). Into 3Q, management clarified 3QTD (August) trends are roughly in-line w/ the FY25 US revenue guidance of down -1 to -2% Y/Y, implying a continued deceleration in August relative to 2Q’s -0.5%. To that point, management’s 2H25 US revenue outlook implies at the midpoint a US revenue decline of 3% Y/Y, equating to a ~350bps 2-yr stacked deceleration vs 1H25. • Canada 2Q Deceleration w/ Embedded 2H25 Softness: Canada revenues grew +1% in 2Q (vs. 1Q +9% c/c) with mgmt noting trends across the Canadian market converged to the challenging macro backdrop experienced in the US, with the consumer increasingly selective in their spend w/ mgmt citing “they are spending less on styles they already have, and spending less overall”. Looking ahead, management cited Canada 3QTD is tracking below the Canada’s FY25 guide of Flat Y/Y revenue growth, with 2H25 Canadian revenues embedded to decelerate to a 3-4% decline Y/Y (< 1H25 revenues +4.7% c/c) to bridge to the full year Flat c/c revenue outlook.

On Rest of World, 2Q revenues grew +19% Y/Y c/c (vs. 1Q +16% Y/Y), with FY25 revenue growth expectations for Rest of World reiterated to grow ~20% Y/Y, with management clarifying no material acceleration is expected in 2H25 ROW revenues (vs. 1H) emphasizing the “approximately” 20% growth rate guidance for the full year. • Tying back to our 7/22 Downgrade to Neutral & representing a factor to watch – management continues to target a +Low-30s CAGR Internationally (FY21-26), including a similar Low-30s planned CAGR in China, which implies by our math further potential moderation, or “normalization” of revenue growth rates in China into FY26 to +Low-to-Mid-Teens (< FY25’s +20-25% growth outlook) to bridge to the low-30s CAGR. To that end, relative to a +48% CAGR experienced in FY23/24 (vs. FY21), management noted stronger growth was experienced in the first 3 years of the 5-year Investor Day plan in China as the team scaled stores & initial brand awareness investments (w/ 70 China Mainland stores in FY21 more than doubling to 159 doors as of 2Q25 vs. ~200 FY26 Investor Day target), relative to slower growth rates anticipated in the latter years of the 5-yr plan to result in the +Low-30s CAGR target.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250910_JP_Morgan_LULU_lululemon_athletica_inc.-_2Q_Stacked_Moderation_-_2H_Cut.pdf

Looking ahead, management lowered the FY25 gross margin outlook to decline ~300bps Y/Y to 56.2% (below -110bps prior guide & relative to Street -140bps), with the ~190bps delta to prior guidance driven by (i) a -220bps net tariff headwind (vs. -40bps prior) and (ii) a -50bps markdowns headwind (vs. ~10-20bps headwind prior), partially offset by (iii) enterprise wide efforts to mitigate costs (implied ~25bps of savings identified). Specifically on the cadence of the back half, management guided 3Q gross margins to decline 410bps Y/Y to 54.4% (below Street 56.6%) reflecting a 230bps tariff headwind, ~80bps markdown headwind, and deleverage on fixed costs. This implies 4Q gross margin degradation of ~590bps Y/Y to 54.5% (vs. Street 58.5%), inclusive of a ~470bps net tariff headwind by our estimates, ~60bps markdown headwind, and continued fixed cost deleverage to bridge to the full year outlook. • Worth noting on 2026, management quantified a $320M net tariff impact anticipated, representing an incremental YOY headwind to FY26 from tariffs of $80M, or a ~70bps headwind to gross margins based on current mitigation assumptions. The incremental tariff headwind combined with continued fixed cost deleverage on our +MSD% consolidated revenue growth assumptions (multi-year DC project investment & ~LDD% implied occupancy leverage point by our math) translates to FY26 gross margin degradation of 125bps Y/Y to 54.9% on our estimates (below Street 57.6%). • Digging Deeper on Markdowns: 2Q markdowns represented a 60bps headwind Y/Y within gross margin, representing a shortfall relative to management’s expectations for 2Q to realize a 20-40bps markdown headwind Y/Y. Into 2H25, management’s guidance embeds an -80bps markdown headwind (worsening relative to 2Q’s - 60bps drag), with an implied ~50bps markdown headwind anticipated in 4Q to bridge to mgmt’s full year ~50bps markdown guidance (below the prior -10-20bps outlook). Driving the higher markdowns, management cited higher levels of seasonal clearance, while the overall markdown & promotional strategy remain unchanged with an intent to clear end-of-season products through stores, online, outlets, and warehouse CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R.

To that end, management noted expectations inventories to be in a healthier position exiting the year into FY26 stating “as we look out to next year, we aim to manage our inventory in-line with sales trends, and we would expect our inventory growth on a unit basis to moderate beginning in Q1 2026.”",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250910_JP_Morgan_LULU_lululemon_athletica_inc.-_2Q_Stacked_Moderation_-_2H_Cut.pdf

Morgan. #4: FY25 Operating Margin Outlook Reduced to Below 20% w/ Further FY26 Deleverage: Management lowered FY25’s operating margin outlook to decline -390bps to 19.8% (vs. -160bps decline to ~22.1% prior guidance), with ~190bps of the negative revision associated with a lowered gross margin outlook to 56.2% (vs. 58.1% prior) and ~35bps associated with SG&A expenses (80-90bps of deleverage now anticipated vs. 50bps deleverage anticipated prior). Regarding the modest increase in SG&A deleverage (vs. prior), management cited headwinds from the lower topline growth outlook, FX headwinds, and ongoing investments into the Power of 3x2 plan (including investments to support market growth, international expansion, and continued investments in technology), which are more than offsetting “several enterprise-wide cost-savings initiatives”. Said differently, management’s SG&A expense outlook calling for ~80-90bps of deleverage on the +2- 4% reported revenue growth outlook implies an 11.5% fixed cost leverage hurdle (with ~LDD% similarly implied on occupancy expenses by our math), constraining forward bottom-line flow-through on single-digit revenue growth. In addition, we note SG&A expenses in FY25 have favorably benefited by the reversal of incentive compensation accruals (quantified as a ~60bps tailwind to 2Q25 results), with our work pointing to an IC headwind to FY26 results on a more normalized topline growth plan. Put together, we are modeling FY26 operating margin degradation of 220bps Y/Y to 17.5% (vs. Street 21.1%) driven by gross margin degradation of -125bps Y/Y (largely tariff-driven) and SG&A deleverage of 85bps Y/Y, with our 17.5% operating margin profile ~480bps below LULU’s pre-pandemic 22.3% profile. Model Implications: We lower FY25 EPS to $12.84 (vs. Street $14.35) and FY26 EPS to $12.33 (vs. Street $15.25). Remain Neutral lowering our Dec ’26 price target to $191 based on 15x our FY27 EPS.

On margins, LULU reported 2Q GPM decline of -110bps y/y to 58.5% (above Street 57.5%) driven by (1) -70bps contraction in product margin due to (i) -80bps from higher markdowns, tariffs and other costs, partially offset by higher pricing and lower product costs, and (ii) +10bps of favorable FX, (2) -40bps of fixed cost deleverage. On expenses, 2Q SG&A $s increased +9.0% y/y, equating to deleverage of -90bps (vs Street 190bps) driven by (i) -110bps deleverage from our operating channel costs, and (ii) -40bps deleverage on D&A, partially offset by (iii) -60bps of leverage from corporate SG&A expenses driven by a reversal of stock-based compensation expense, translating to 20.7% EBIT margins (vs. Street 18.9%). • Balance Sheet Snapshot: LULU ended 2Q with cash & cash equivalents of $1.3B (1Q $1.2B) and no LT debt with $393.2M available under revolving credit facilities (1Q $393.4M).

Risks to Rating and Price Target While LULU has a substantial sq. ft. growth opportunity both domestically and internationally, this comes with risk given the execution and focus needed to efficiently open low-double-digit square footage growth while supporting comp growth through product innovation. In addition, the economic climate, particularly the employment picture, can affect consumer spending and the sportswear industry. A greater-than-expected downturn in household spending could cause sales trends to decelerate below our current assumptions, rendering our estimates too high.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R.

Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe.

Proprietary PRISM Curve From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 2 and Figure 3 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe LULU has just entered the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises. As market share erodes, the lack of sales is causing operating deleverage. During the TRAP phase, management’s strategy is on the defensive – meaning actions are being taken to change business trends, but the issues have not yet stabilized. Typically, the company has been leading the competitive playing field but above-average profits and growth attract new entrants, creating a more challenging competitive backdrop. FIGURE 2.

Recall, we measure the promo levels in the ""We Made Too Much"" (WMTM) clearance section, and note that during FY2Q25 this section saw a notable increase in depth and frequency of for the duration of the quarter. Average WMTM units increased 44% y/y in 2Q25 from +3% in 1Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion. The sharp inflection in WMTM activity raises questions about inventory management and full- price sell-through, particularly as the brand navigates challenges in its U.S. stores amidst a more competitive and value-sensitive consumer environment.

Tariff exposure update. In FY25, tariff related pressure on GM is expected to amount to (220bps), up from prior tariff guidance of (40bps), with most of the heightened impact tied to (170bps) of de-minimis exemption impacts, and the balance attributable to higher underlying country rates. In FY26, the tariff pressure will continue, with an estimated tariff impact of ~$320mn likely to have an outsized impact on 1H26. Prior tariff commentary. The company provided an updated view of tariff impacts in FY25 guidance, now seeing (40bps) of GM pressure from tariffs, up from the prior guide which saw (20bps) of tariff pressure. The company expects 2Q25 to see the largest impact, with a (60bps) impact before mitigation strategies can begin to offset in 2H25. On this note, the company indicated a willingness to pursue strategic price increases on a small portion of its assortment. In LULU's most recent 10-K, the company provided details on its global manufacturing mix by country: ""During 2024, 40% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia, and 7% in Bangladesh, and the remainder in other regions."" On the 3Q24 Earnings Call 12/5/24: ""We have very limited exposure in China, we source approximately 3% of goods from China. So exposure there is relatively small. Our sourcing from Mexico is less than half a percentage, and we don't source anything from Canada."" Barclays Tariff ""QuikCalc"" Model assumptions. We update our Tariff ""QuikCalc"" model analysis, which now assumes global tariff assumptions effective 8/7/25. Our prior tariff analysis assumed 30% China and 10% Rest of World (excluding Mexico and Canada). Note our estimate of Tariff on Goods Imported to the US is a gross unmitigated amount for a full year, and we calculate the price increase necessary to mitigate full tariff cost (absent other mitigation strategies). Our updated tariff calculator under 8/7/25 effective rates suggests that for LULU total average unit cost will increase by 11.9% with pass-through to the US market only increasing prices by 5.7% (see Figure 8). 4 September 2025 11 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20250911_Barclays_LULU_lululemon_athletica_inc.-_2Q25_Review-_Multiple_Headwind.pdf

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"": U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a 4 September 2025 22 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes.

Unexpectedly, the bulk of the margin pressure comes from the elimination of the de minimis exemption, which was not a risk that we believe investors (or analysts) were aware of. Of the 220bps of tariff-related pressure this year, 170bps stems from the elimination of the exemption. Q3 gross margin is expected to be down 410bps YoY, which implies Q4 will be down ~600bps. While they expect some mitigation next year as well, they believe that the net impact to COGS from tariffs will be ~$320 million, or ~300bps to margins (implying another ~80bps of headwind next year). Tom's Takeaway #3: Markdowns Creeping Up As Well. In addition to the tariff headwind, elevated inventory levels (+21% in Q2 and expected to be up similar amounts in Q3 and Q4 as well) led to an expectation for incremental markdowns (now planned at a 50bps headwind for the year vs. 10-20bps headwind prior).

Next year, we even worse than expected, and generates macro environment doesn't deteriorate expect flattish comps (down domestically, negative global comp growth next year any further, leading to a FY25 earnings up internationally), with some footage (-MSD in North America and slightly beat and a faster re-acceleration of growth resulting in MSD consolidated positive overseas). Amid slowing sales and revenues in FY26. In this scenario, we think revenue growth. We assume margins the wrap-around of tariffs, we assume FY26 EPS power could be ~$14.00. At a decline 250bps due to the wrap-around of discounting increases, and the company high-teens P/E multiple, the stock could be tariffs, incremental markdown pressure, experiences ~350bps of EBIT margin ~$250. and fixed-cost deleverage, resulting in erosion next year. In this scenario, FY26 FY26 EPS power of $12.00-$12.50. Our EPS declines to below $11.00. At a low- price target of $192 is based on a 15x-16x teens P/E multiple, the stock could fall to P/E on our FY26 EPS estimate of $12.20. ~$140.

LULU's business in NA has been one of the strongest and most consistent in the softlines space over the past 10+ years—with comps averaging 10-15% over that time as the brand took share in a rapidly growing ""athleisure"" space. However, the brand is in unchartered waters today, unable to comp positive in 12+ months with the US market negative and struggling due to a lack of innovation on core product and increasing competition from new entrants (namely Alo Yoga and Vuori, as well as others).

Emerging Competition. While competition concerns have always surrounded LULU, there are",8,3,6,"signs that emerging brands are perhaps eating into LULU's dominant position in athleisure. Alo has carved a niche in the premium/fashion segment of ath-leisure and is opening stores at a significant pace. Vuori is a brand that is beginning to take real market share from LULU in regions such as Southern California (where Vuori is headquartered). We also believe Fabletics is re-accelerating growth to the mid to high teens range. Notably many LULU alums have joined competitors in the past several years, driven by: 1) the changing culture at LULU and 2) a similar ethos to when LULU was in its early days. Further, the increased competition may force LULU to begin spending heavier on marketing, which could weigh on margins—notably LULU's marketing spend as a % of sales (4-5%) is one of the lowest among brands in our coverage (avg. 8-10%). Equity Research | 3 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on LULU shares. Exhibit 1 - The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Source: © iStockphoto.com The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on LULU shares are focused on: (1) LULU implements a stringent re-focus on the US market and overhauls virtually every aspect of the business, (2) international growth (led by MLC) should enable LULU to continue hitting their top-line algo, (3) issues in N. Amer are finally addressed and LULU has already signaled weakness into 2026 - thus lowering the 2H bar; and (4) valuation is at all-time lows and creates a compelling risk/reward. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on LULU shares are likely focused on: (1) their core NA market continues to under-perform and is undergoing a full strategic review (which will weigh on LULU's industry-leading margins); (2) inventory has become an issue with 20%+ growth exiting each of the last two quarters (1Q25, 2Q25), (3) the business pushes into international markets with higher operating costs, and investors question the trajectory of markdowns go-forward; and (4) competition remains strong, and could pressure margins if LULU needed to ramp their industry-low demand creation dollars (marketing spend). 4 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc. Equity Research Financial Outlook FY25E Our FY25E EPS estimate of $12.85 represents EPS down -12% YoY. We project net sales up ~4% on comps up ~1% and +MSD footage growth.

(LULU) Investment Thesis LULU is an industry leader in an attractive market (athletic apparel). We believe the company has ample white space overseas and will continue to post outsized international growth. However, the slowdown in North America along with an ""over earning"" P&L are a concern and keep us cautious over the next 12 months. We are Equal Weight rated. Target Price Valuation for LULU: $160.00 from $205.00 Our $160 price target reflects a 13x FY26E P/E. We believe a discount to history is warranted given that LULU is dealing with merchandising issues domestically, while operating at record margins as competition around them is heating up while US comps are trending negative with margin pressures growing. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for LULU Upside risks (1) SSS accelerate; (2) North America slowdown is not as drastic as expected, and (3) international growth (particulary in China) is better than expected. Downside risks (1) increasing competition within athleisure market; (2) slowing comps, and (3) international growth stalls Companies Mentioned in Report Company Name Ticker Last Price Rating (09/04/25) lululemon athletica, inc.

WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.

One of the issues facing LULU is the rise of new athleisure brands, some of whom are operating at similar price points and opening stores in similar real estate. With brands such as Alo, Vuori, Fabletics, Athleta, and others all providing ""athleisure"" options for consumers, we believe it is stifling LULU's growth. Additionally, other non-athletic brands have branched into the space (Free People Movement, Offline by Aerie, Victoria's Secret VSX, etc.), making the environment even more competitive. Another issue facing the company, in our view, is the trend shift towards denim (a category where LULU does not participate). Younger consumers have clearly gravitated to wide-leg jeans in recent years, potentially at the expense of LULU's core product (women's tight-fitting leggings). Maybe The Biz Needs A Breather After Such A Long Run. While trends have been choppy of late, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that LULU has been one of the biggest success stories in Softlines in the past 10-15 years. But given the fact that they basically tripled North American revenues between 2017 and 2023 and went viral post-pandemic with the ""belt bag"" phenomenon, the difficult multi-year compares might simply necessitate a ""lull"" before resuming the upward trajectory. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 9 OF THIS REPORT. September 25, 2025 At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS LULU is a strong brand with long-term growth drivers, but the operating environment has become more challenging. BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS In our bull case we assume that they We're modeling FY25 within current In our bear case, we assume FY25 comes in ""right the ship"" in the U.S. and the sales and EPS guidance. Next year, we even worse than expected, and generates macro environment doesn't deteriorate expect flattish comps (down domestically, negative global comp growth next year any further, leading to a FY25 earnings up internationally), with some footage (-MSD in North America and slightly beat and a faster re-acceleration of growth resulting in MSD consolidated positive overseas). Amid slowing sales and revenues in FY26. In this scenario, we think revenue growth. We assume margins the wrap-around of tariffs, we assume FY26 EPS power could be ~$13.00. At a decline 250bps due to the wrap-around of discounting increases, and the company high-teens P/E multiple, the stock could be tariffs, incremental markdown pressure, experiences ~350bps of EBIT margin ~$230. and fixed-cost deleverage, resulting in erosion next year. In this scenario, FY26 FY26 EPS power of $12.00-$12.50. The EPS declines to below $11.00. At a low- stock is currently trading at 14x our FY26 teens P/E multiple, the stock could fall to EPS forecast of $12.20. ~$130. COMPANY DESCRIPTION LULU is a women's focused athleisure brand headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. The products, which also include a growing Men's business, are sold almost entirely via the company's own stores and websites.

Daily Volume 6,586,299.5 Lululemon Athletica, Inc. / 2 September 25, 2025 LULU'S PROBLEM #1: COMPETITION FROM OTHER ATHLEISURE BRANDS The rise of new athleisure brands such as Alo, Vuori, and Fabletics has often been cited as a major contributor to LULU's domestic slowdown, and we agree that these brands have become a competitive problem for LULU. We believe that these brands have increasingly gained brand awareness and are giving athleisure shoppers more options of where to buy their apparel. In the case of Alo and Vuori, we think it's noteworthy that they have similar product assortments (with their own unique focuses) and price points, demonstrating that they clearly are ""fishing in the same pond"" as LULU. Figure 1 - Alo And Vuori Are Generally Operating At Similar Price Points As LULU Source: Company websites and Needham & Co. Furthermore, it's clear that both of these brands have generated significant ""buzz"" with consumers. This is most clearly seen in online search data, via Google Trends. According to this data, searches for Alo and Vuori have both grown massively in recent years. And the momentum doesn't seem to be slowing despite the challenging macro environment: U.S. Google searches for Alo grew more than 150% YoY in August, while Vuori was also strong at +35%. Admittedly, this data set was also positive for LULU (+25% in August), though they're not growing to nearly the same extent as Alo/Vuori. Figure 2 - U.S. Google Searches For Alo (Left) and Vuori (Right) Have Exploded Higher In Recent Years Source: Google Trends As private companies, we do not know the revenues generated by these brands, but we believe that in aggregate they are likely a few billion dollars of sales. We do know the store counts, which combined are ~320 doors in the U.S., which is not meaningfully smaller than LULU's ~375 U.S. doors. When we also consider Athleta (which admittedly has struggled in recent years), which gives athleisure shoppers yet another option to buy, we see that there is quite a bit of competition in the athleisure space.

LULU'S PROBLEM #2: DENIM CYCLE TAKES CONSUMER FOCUS AWAY FROM LULU'S CORE While LULU's faces competition within the athleisure market, we believe they also face a headwind from female consumers increasingly diversifying their closets away from athleisure. Specifically, we believe that the industry is in the midst of a strong ""denim cycle"", which could be crowding out demand for leggings. Furthermore, with women's bottoms increasingly becoming baggier, it further moves the fashion trend away from LULU's ""core"" (tight-fitting yoga pants). Indeed, since 1Q24, we have seen increased strong top-line trends at brands such as LEVI and KTB's Wrangler brand, both of which have been consistently posting ~HSD global organic growth in recent quarters. Meanwhile, we've seen a corresponding slowdown in athleisure brands such as LULU (comping negative in North America) and GAP's Athleta brand (who has seen consistently negative sales growth over the past 2-3 years). Figure 4 - Denim Brands Are Posting Strong Top-Line Results While Athleisure Brands Fade Source: Company reports Lululemon Athletica, Inc. / 4 September 25, 2025 More specifically, over the last couple of years, there appears to be a significant silhouette change which is driving the denim refresh. For the past 10-15 years, skinny pants were extremely popular, which benefited athleisure brands who could make pants that were both skinny AND comfortable. However, there has recently been a shift towards wide leg pants, led primarily by younger consumers/Gen Z. Importantly, we believe this silhouette shift is unlocking demand for denim, as it's far easier for denim to compete from a comfort perspective when the trend is for wide-leg pants. Indeed, worldwide Google searches for ""Wide Leg Jeans"" were roughly flat from 2004 to 2020, but have since been on a steady climb, and currently appear to be at their all-time high (since Google started tracking search trends in 2004). Figure 5 - Google Search Trends for ""Wide Leg Jeans"" are at an All-Time Peak Source: Google Trends Indeed, a rather sizable number of softlines brands and retailers have specifically called out denim as being a significant growth driver on their most recent earnings call. These companies include a wide range of companies including other global wholesale brands (KTB, PVH), department stores (KSS, M), mall based specialty retailers (GAP, URBN), mass merchants (TGT), and Western specialty retailers (BOOT) LULU'S PROBLEM #3: A VICTIM OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS? While trends have been choppier of late, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that LULU has been one of the biggest success stories in Softlines in recent years. While some people in the investment community have viewed LULU as a ""pandemic winner"", the brand was on fire even before the pandemic struck: Global comp sales were +18% in both FY18 and FY19, with total North America growth of ~20% each of those two years. As a result, LULU more than tripled its North American revenue base between FY17 and FY23.

We believe these shoppers were drawn in by the Belt Bag, and they ended up shopping the apparel assortment as well.

U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear NEW American Express Platinum Card Benefits. On 9/18/25, American Express (AXP) Adrienne Yih announced updated Platinum Card benefits, including: ""NEW – $300 lululemon Credit: Up to $75 +1 212 526 5257 back in statement credits each quarter for eligible purchases at retail lululemon stores (excluding adrienne.yih@barclays.com outlets) or lululemon.com in the U.S. when Card Members pay with the Platinum Card."" We believe BCI, US the AmEx benefits could provide a boost to consolidated comp sales growth rate (> 100bps) in Paul Kearney 3Q25, with the $75/qtr in benefits to drive increased transactions, which we detail below (Figure +1 212 526 1964 3 and Figure 4). The goal of such a perk is often to 1) acquire new customers, 2) re-engage lapsed paul.kearney@barclays.com customers, and 3) provide an incentive for existing customers to transact. While all of these are BCI, US beneficial to LULU, we see this as a promotional incentive that uses marginal cost to drive Angus Kelleher marginal revenue. So long as the gains and benefits outweigh the incentive cost, this should be +1 212 526 0081 a positive in the near term. Nonetheless, LULU has historically earned its premium brand equity angus.kelleherferguson@barclays.com by maintaining high full-price selling and limiting promotional tactics. We acknowledge the BCI, US targeted high HH income target market and the potential engagement opportunities afforded by Michael Vu this partnership. This AmEx offering is a new mode of promotion, and even if AmEx co-funds a +1 212 526 9568 portion of the benefit, we are monitoring LULU's breadth of new incentive-type offering to michael.vu@barclays.com engage customers. BCI, US LULU website traffic picks up upon AmEx incentive launch (Figure 1). LULU's target U.S. Consumer Finance customer has always been the higher HH income brackets and certainly the AmEx Platinum card Terry Ma, CFA +1 212 526 7965 targets this affluent US customer. We assume that many of LULU customers may indeed have terry.ma@barclays.com the American Express Platinum card. Store checks conducted since the announcement have BCI, US validated that many customers are indeed taking advantage of this offer. Below, we show the spike in LULU website traffic since the 9/18 announcement. In LULU's FY3Q25, there are two Cordelia R Deng +1 212 526 7625 opportunities to use this benefit: once in calendar CY3Q25 ending September 30, 2025 and once cordeliar.deng@barclays.com beginning October 1, 2025 as CY4Q25 begins.

Source: Barclays Data Science, Similarweb Barclays Comp Lift ""QuikCalc"" sensitivity suggests potential meaningful lift. We believe a reasonable base case assumption is that the majority of AmEx customers would use the LULU benefit. Our base case is that 60% of the 1.5mn Platinum cardholders would use the benefit and result in a roughly ~280bps lift to comps for the quarter (Figure 2). Total projected sales lift may be understated as it does not factor in basket sizes exceeding $75, or the possibility that some cardholders may redeem both their CY3Q25 and CY4Q25 AmEx benefits within the same LULU fiscal quarter. Total projected sales lift may be overstated as it does not factor in potential cannibalization from AmEx cardholders who might otherwise have transacted via a different credit card. Additionally, we highlight one final consideration regarding the timing of the impact: based on our checks, some customers are using a loophole of the AmEx benefit by purchasing physical LULU gift cards with the credit, which creates deferred sales that could be recognized in future quarters, such as FY4Q25. Reiterate EW rating, estimates unchanged as terms of the AmEx deal are unclear for margins. In our view, the AmEx deal introduces incremental margin risk by using a promo- adjacent traffic-driver to fuel sales growth. Even if the intent is to acquire and re-engage customers, we do see this as a promotion. We do not have enough information to assess the return on promo spend. Promotional guidance Deeper for 2H25. We note that LULU previously cautioned on greater promo usage during its 2Q25 earnings, with updated GM guidance for FY25 issued on 9/4/25 factoring-in deeper promo impacts due to increased use of markdowns, with the new FY25 promo guide calling for (50bps) of pressure, up from prior guidance calling for (10bps) to (20bps) of pressure. (We originally cautioned on LULU's promo risk here: 2Q25 Preview & Promo Tracker: Positive TPR, ULTA, URBN, VSCO; Cautious GAP, LULU - 06 Aug 2025). Given the several headwinds LULU faces in the near term, we remain on the sidelines, balancing our medium- term cautious view against potential for comp lift from the new AmEx partnership, recently lowered guidance, and potential to perform better than consensus expectations in the near term. 1 October 2025 2 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. QuikCalc Comp Lift Sensitivity Methodology. Below we provide our sensitivity analysis estimating incremental sales and comp lift from AmEx Platinum cardholders redeeming the $75 quarterly credit at LULU. We use a matrix of utilization rates (x-axis) and total cardholders (y-axis), assuming a $75 basket. This analysis focuses on the potential sales lift directly attributable to the AmEx offer. Total projected sales lift may be understated as it does not factor in basket sizes exceeding $75, or the possibility that some cardholders may redeem both their CY3Q25 and CY4Q25 AmEx benefits within the same LULU fiscal quarter. Total projected sales lift may be overstated as it does not factor in potential cannibalization from AmEx cardholders who might otherwise have transacted via a different credit card.

American Express (AXP, covered by Terry Ma) - Funding of LULU Credits Key Takeaway: Overall, we view the recent Amex Platinum card refresh as cardholder friendly. AXP increased the annual fee on the card by $200 to $895, but increased the value proposition with an additional ~$1,400 in credits. More importantly, we view key elements of the increased value prop (e.g., $400 Resy, $300 lululemon, and expanded digital credit) as relatively easy to use and likely to have broad appeal across different consumer cohorts. AXP has continued to shift towards more co-funded and merchant funded credits. Approximately 27% of the consumer platinum card's redeemed credits in 2023 were merchant funded, up from 2% in",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20251007_Barclays_LULU_lululemon_athletica_inc.-_Flagging_AmEx_Partnership-_Com.pdf

This strategy of merchant and co-funding enables AXP to provide more value to its,5,4,8,"customer base with each refresh, while controlling increases to its Variable Customer Engagement (VCE) ratio. While it is hard to pin down the exact mix with the current refresh as neither AXP nor its merchant partners disclose it, we expect the percentage of merchant funding to tick up, and believe lululemon credit is at least co-funded. Partnership Benefits: The incentive for LULU and other merchant partners to participate in the co-funding of credits is AXP's affluent customer base. As of May 2025, approximately 55% of US consumer spend at Amex is from customers with $200k plus in annual income, which could result in additional sales lift beyond the value of the credit. More importantly, the credits are structured per quarter, which incentivizes consumer engagement with the Platinum card and the merchant throughout the year. Cost Sharing Between Amex and Merchants: There is limited disclosure on the mix of co- funded versus fully merchant funded. AXP did disclose that the $100 Saks credit in 2018 was fully merchant funded. In addition, at AXP's 2024 Investor Day, the company had highlighted ~27% of its Platinum card redeemed statement credits in 2023 was funded by partners, compared to 2% in 2018. This implies by our calculation that roughly $440 of credits were funded by merchants.

LULU Promotions Materially Picked Up YTD 2025 LULU 2Q25 Score Deeper, Promo Score 0/100: Our Proprietary Promo Score is a measurement of the percent of the quarter that a company is less promotional than prior year. Promo Scores 0 to 33 are considered ""Deeper;"" Promo Scores 34 to 66 are considered ""Flat;"" and Promo Scores 67 to 100 are considered ""Better."" YTD, LULU promotions have materially increased y/y. We acknowledge the tough compares in 2024 as LULU pulled back on promotions and recovered from 1H24 product missteps. 2Q25 negative promotional inflection. Notably in 2Q25 LULU promotions inflected to ""Deeper."" In 2Q25 our proprietary checks recorded a Promo Score of 0/100 in FY2Q25, down sharply from 46/100 last quarter, marking its most promotional quarter in recent history. Recall, we measure the promo levels in the ""We Made Too Much"" (WMTM) clearance section, and note that during FY2Q25 this section saw a notable increase in depth and frequency for the duration of the quarter. Average WMTM units increased 44% y/y in 2Q25 from +3% in 1Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion. The sharp inflection in WMTM activity raises questions about inventory management and full-price sell- through, particularly as the brand navigates challenges in its U.S. stores amidst a more competitive and value-sensitive consumer environment.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: If AXP meets its aspirational LT growth target of 10% plus revenue growth, the shares could potentially re-rate higher. Additional risks to the upside include slower-than-anticipated credit normalization, in which case AXP could lower its reserve ratio resulting in an earnings tailwind. Downside risks include faster-than-anticipated credit normalization and/or a recession, in which case AXP would need to increase its reserve ratio resulting in an earnings headwind. 1 October 2025 11 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. lululemon athletica inc.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a 1 October 2025 15 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated.

Daily Volume 3,638,517.8 the company to become the Chief Revenue Officer at Vail Resorts. This is LULU's 2nd high- profile executive departure in the last 18 months, following 2024's departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe. Many investors viewed Ms. Choe and Ms. Burgoyne as two of they key architects to LULU's ascendance, so the loss of both of these key executives, during a period of turbulence for the brand in North America, is not ideal. Ms. Burgoyne, in particular, was a key source of stability and consistency at LULU, having joined the company nearly 20 years ago, when revenues were a paltry $150 million (vs. nearly $8 billion in the Americas last year). Due to her departure, LULU is consolidating global leadership, with head of International Andre Maestrini assuming the newly-created role of Chief Commercial Officer. All in, we think that Ms. Burgoyne's departure adds an additional layer of uncertainty to the North American turnaround, in addition to the challenging macro environment, increasingly intense competitive landscape, and potential ""athleisure fatigue"" by consumers. As a result, we remain sidelined on LULU shares pending greater visibility into improvement domestically. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 4 OF THIS REPORT. November 21, 2025 At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS LULU is a strong brand with long-term growth drivers, but the operating environment has become more challenging. BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS In our bull case we assume that they We're modeling FY25 within current In our bear case, we assume FY25 comes in ""right the ship"" in the U.S. and the sales and EPS guidance. Next year, we even worse than expected, and generates macro environment doesn't deteriorate expect flattish comps (down domestically, negative global comp growth next year any further, leading to a FY25 earnings up internationally), with some footage (-MSD in North America and slightly beat and a faster re-acceleration of growth resulting in MSD consolidated positive overseas). Amid slowing sales and revenues in FY26. In this scenario, we think revenue growth. We assume margins the wrap-around of tariffs, we assume FY26 EPS power could be ~$13.00. At a decline 250bps due to the wrap-around of discounting increases, and the company high-teens P/E multiple, the stock could be tariffs, incremental markdown pressure, experiences ~350bps of EBIT margin ~$230. and fixed-cost deleverage, resulting in erosion next year. In this scenario, FY26 FY26 EPS power of $12.00-$12.50. The EPS declines to below $11.00. At a low- stock is currently trading at 14x our FY26 teens P/E multiple, the stock could fall to EPS forecast of $12.20. ~$130.

Riding China's Growing Yoga, Training Gear Demand",0,1,1,"Lululemon and Anta's Maia Active are well-positioned to capture Chinese consumers' growing appetite for specialist yoga and training gear in 2026. They posted steeper online sales growth in October-November than Nike, Adidas, Anta and other multisport brands, based on Tmall, JD.com and Douyin data collected by Shang Zhi Zhen, reflecting strong demand for the brands. Lululemon doubling its sales in the period further raises the likelihood that it can reach the upper end of its 20-25% sales-growth target for China this year if demand in higher-tier cities stabilizes. Lower-than-expected February-July sales, along with expectations that a late Lunar New Year holiday -- in February 2026 vs. January this year -- will delay festive purchases, prompted Lululemon to cut its 2025 China sales-growth goal from 25-30% on Sept. 5.

Lululemon Discounts to Aid Product Reset Ahead,1,1,2,"Lululemon can reach the higher end of its 2025 sales-growth target if it keeps discounts elevated through January while using 2026's product reset to normalize markdowns thereafter. The company's 18% average online discount in October-November, though low vs. multisport peers, according to Shang Zhi Zhen data, was almost double last year's level. This was likely driven by clearance of older, casual and lounge inventory before a refreshed 2026 assortment, which is expected to lift new-style penetration from 23% to about 35% globally by next spring.

Strength in international markets, particularly China, and steady gains in men's are key offsets, though the US is likely to remain under pressure. A meaningful turnaround will depend on renewed product innovation and sharper execution under a new CEO, expected in 2026. Supply-chain efficiencies can lend support, yet will likely only partly counter the drag from tariffs and heavier promotions. (12/11/25) Key Topics Summary Near Term Strength:Building sales momentum is key to Lululemon reaching 2026 goals, yet revenue could slow to just 2-4% in 2025 on softer consumer spending amid inflation and tariff concerns. Gross margin might drop 300 bps this year, based on guidance, amid tariff headwinds and higher markdowns. The company's membership program and product innovation can help, with newness key to aiding sales. Regional Growth:Lululemon's sales growth could moderate further in 2025, yet growth needs to accelerate by double digits in 2026 if it wants to double revenue through fiscal 2026 and expand 15% compounded annually from 2021-26. International is at the forefront of the $12.5 billion sales goal and can quadruple as the company expands into new and core markets, led by China and gains in Europe. DTC Catalysts:Lululemon could maintain its store productivity this year while expanding its omnichannel offerings, store footprint and membership programs. Foundational investments across its digital platform to boost traffic, average order value and conversion are core to reaching its goal of doubling digital sales by 2026, with an emphasis on improving inventory accuracy and enhanced storytelling.

Taking Men’s Franchise to Another Level After sales in its men's business doubled to $1.5 billion in 2021, ahead of a 2023 target, Lululemon is aiming for the category to log double-digit compound annual growth in 2021-26. The brand is still behind key companies in men's sportswear, like Nike and Adidas, but Lululemon's pipeline of new products could aid credibility. New franchises Mile Maker, Zeroed In, Steady State, ShowZero and Soft Jersey, along with expanding the Pace Breaker franchise into jackets and pants and freshening License to Train, might also help. The company's men's loungewear campaign with DK Metcalf and Odell Beckham Jr. could raise awareness. Men's sales rose 6% in 2Q. Lululemon extended its Fast and Free franchise to men's, attracting shoppers who prioritize performance, competing directly with peers’ running offerings.

Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing.

A sustainable turnaround appears elusive in the near term. The planned 2026 CEO transition offers a key catalyst, with expectations for a product-led leader who can reignite innovation. Management's initiatives -- raising new-product penetration toward 35% by spring, enhancing in-store experiences and improving local and strategic product curation -- are sound, though consistent execution is essential to restoring traction. Tariffs will remain a headwind, with guidance for a 410-bp hit to gross margin in 4Q, and continue to weigh into 2026. CEO Calvin McDonald is stepping down in January.

Home Depot, Lowe's Well Positioned to Navigate Tariffs",51,18,18,"Contributing Analysts Drew Reading (Homebuilders) Home Depot and Lowe's size and sourcing diversification in the past several years have them positioned to navigate tariff uncertainty. Home Depot sources a majority of its products from the US and no single country will account for more than 10% of purchases in the next year. Lowe's gets 60% of products from the US, with China accounting for roughly 20% of purchasing volume. Both retailers will keep diversifying, while taking a portfolio approach to pricing. Floor & Decor has also diversified away from China, with 18% of products sold coming from the country vs. 50% in 2018. It plans to reduce this to mid- to low single digits by year-end. Still, 73% of the retailers products are from outside the US, creating greater risk to profit. Management believes it can mitigate most of the effect.

Tariffs Hit Retail Apparel Margin in 2H, 2026",52,18,19,"Contributing Analysts Mary Ross Gilbert (Retail) Most apparel brands, including Gap, Abercrombie, Victoria's Secret, American Eagle and Ralph Lauren, are shifting production away from China, where tariffs dropped to 20% from 30% effective Nov. 10, toward lower-cost regions such as Vietnam (20%), Cambodia (19%), Indonesia (19%) and Bangladesh (20%). These moves will influence margins through the rest of 2H and into 1H26, even after mitigation. Ralph Lauren stands out, as stronger sales and higher average prices more than offset tariff pressure. A 50% levy on India-made goods could pressure apparel margins. Abercrombie may be most exposed, with India, Vietnam and Cambodia making up 69% of sourcing, potentially cutting margins by over 200 bps this year. Gap, which sources 46% from Vietnam and Indonesia, expects a $150-$175 million hit (100-110 bps) after mitigation. (11/12/25) This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

Tariffs Mostly Passed On, Hit Swiss-Made Most in Top-Luxury Rank",53,19,19,"Contributing Analysts Deborah Aitken (Consumer Products) & Andrea Ferdinando Leggieri (Consumer Products) High gross margins among heritage luxury made-in-Europe brands Hermes, Prada and Brunello Cucinelli make them well placed to absorb US tariffs, with their low cost-of-goods structure limiting the price hikes needed for high-spending consumers. Our scenario suggests mid-single- digit US price hikes are sufficient to offset the levies. By contrast, the likes of Burberry, Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Pandora and Zegna are leaning on more cost cuts as a partial offset. Swiss-based watchmakers Richemont, Rolex and Swatch face steep tariffs for now, and with escalating precious-metal costs will need to share greater pricing exposure, pressuring margins. Ebit at aspirational brands Capri, Dr. Martens, Hugo Boss and Pandora -- more exposed to higher made-in-Asia tariffs -- is also likely to be hit, given limited pricing flexibility.

Retailers' Cautious Price Hikes Fall Short of 10-15% Needed,54,19,19,"Contributing Analysts Tatiana Lisitsina (Retail) European retailers have only recently begun to raise prices in response to US tariffs, and margin recovery will likely be partial. Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing. Management tone remains cautious, signaling the tariff hit is building and not yet peaked. (10/22/25) This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

L'Oreal, Estee Local-Made Softens Tariff Hit, Puig Pricing Helps",55,20,20,"Contributing Analysts Deborah Aitken (Consumer Products) & Andrea Ferdinando Leggieri (Consumer Products) Beauty companies have raised prices globally to offset tariffs by a low single-digit percentage --- plus 1-3% in the US -- without denting volume, helped by localized production and the solid launch pipelines of new innovations (led by fragrance and derma skincare). Estee Lauder and L'Oreal's 70%-plus gross margins, fed by low cost-of-goods models, explains their smaller hikes. Puig faces a larger mismatch, given its greater mix of high-end fragrances imported from Europe, but has stronger pricing power vs. most other categories. Coty has struggled to rely solely on pricing, due to weaker US mass-market demand and its launch-pipeline gaps. Cost-cutting could help, but Ebit stays pressured. Premium brands with market-share leadership have bargaining power to pass on some tariff costs to suppliers and retailers, if required.

One of the last big box retailers to report, we expect ASO to see tailwinds from 1) a record number of new store openings in 3Q25 lifting net sales; 2) Jordan/Nike expansion continuing to show strong momentum and contributing ~100bps to comps, with an outsized lift to new stores; 3) easing SGA pressure; and 4) significant AUR increases expected for 2H25, possibly up double digits in 4Q25, due to tariff pricing pass-through. While we see these positives supporting growth, we note negative offsets due to increasing competitive pressure from the core DKS business, which has consistently shown strong execution, combined with short-term promo pressure in footwear as Foot Locker undergoes a reset and liquidates inventory in 4Q25. Recall, on the 2Q25 earnings call, ASO cited a pullback in the comp trend following BTS season, though 3Q25 guidance factored in an improvement in comps into September / October as compares get easier. We also believe pressure in bigger ticket purchases will be ongoing and outsized for ASO, with the company indicating on its 2Q25 call that demand fell more than prices increased in select big ticket categories. 2Q25 marked a positive inflection in comparable sales with +0.2% growth after having declined since 1Q22. While this is an encouraging change in trend, for us to get more constructive on shares, we would need to see a more sustainable return to sales growth and for inventory to become more inline with sales growth. 8 December 2025 6 Barclays | U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Stock Performance FIGURE 2.

In the time since its IPO in November 2024, GRGD has done an exceptional job navigating through a dynamic retail backdrop. The company is in the very early stages of a U.S. national retail roll-out with both Garage and Dynamite, and management is highly-focused on driving company-specific strategies forward and building brand equity and positioning, rather than focusing on competitors or the environment around them. During this phase of growth, retailers are usually beating sales and margin expectations, brand awareness is growing as they scale store growth, and earnings are growing faster than sales – all of these are true of GRGD, and we expect will remain true for 3Q25 earnings. Recall, GRGD's 2Q25 beat on sales, delivering a strong +29% comp with a positive tone for 3Q25, with comp sales performance tracking similar to 2Q25's levels as of 9/10/25. We reiterate our Overweight on GRGD as we believe 3Q25 will show that the company continues to execute on its strategic initiatives including: 1) opening more stores in Tier 1 and 2 locations while closing lower productive Tier 4 and 5 locations; 2) opening its U.S. distribution center to increase efficiency; 3) long runway for growth within the U.S.; 4) new store/non-comp growth to help drive top-line growth; and 5) on track to expand into the U.K. in 2026, all of which we believe will provide upside in both the short- and long-term. • GRGD: Raising PT to CAD$88 (was CAD$61).

Our PT of CAD$88 (was CAD$61) is based on a NTM P/E multiple of 36x (was 25x) applied to our CY27 adj. EPS of CAD$2.45 (unchanged).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $51 is based on an NTM P/E multiple of 7x applied to our CY27 EPS estimate of $7.27. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We see risks to the upside as: 1) above-average industry growth offers white space opportunities; 2) private label brand momentum exceeds expectations, driving out-performance versus peers; and 3) potential assortment improvement following success with Jordan brand leading to other brand wins. We see risks to the downside as: 1) continued comp declines drive market share losses and expense deleverage; 2) elevated private label penetration increases tariff risk due to higher direct sourcing; and 3) lack of category ownership makes differentiation challenging. 8 December 2025 18 Barclays | U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Groupe Dynamite Inc.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a 8 December 2025 23 Barclays | U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.

Gross margin was 55.6% versus the Street projection of mid-54% range. Operating margin reached 17.0% versus estimates near the mid 14% range. Digital revenue was about $1.1 billion and represented 42% of total revenue, an increase of 13% year over year. Inventory ended at $2.0 billion, up 11% year over year, with units up roughly 4%. In our view, the quarter demonstrated effective margin stewardship despite tariff and markdown pressure. The beat reflects healthy international demand and improved expense discipline, which aligns with the thesis that Lululemon could protect profitability while refreshing product and activating newness into 2026. Measured outlook with explicit tariff impacts Management guided Q4 revenue to $3.50 billion to $3.59 billion and EPS to $4.66 to $4.76, which we believe implies a cautious stance versus the prior year and consensus. For FY Jan 2026, the company raised guidance to revenue of $10.96 billion to $11.05 billion and EPS of $12.92 to $13.02. Profitability outlook reflects gross margin down about 270 basis points for the year, improved from prior expectations, and operating margin down about 390 basis points. Q4 gross margin is expected to decline about 580 basis points year over year, with approximately 410 basis points related to tariffs and the de minimis change. Strategic initiatives focus on three pillars. Product creation will increase new style penetration and shorten development cycles, with chase capabilities targeting six to eight weeks for select items. Product activation will elevate store curation and digital presentation, including a redesigned site and membership enhancements. Enterprise efficiency targets vendor negotiations, distribution network optimization, and targeted pricing actions. Management stated the FY tariff pressure is now about 190 basis points and equals roughly $210 million of net operating income impact. Calvin McDonald noted the product pipeline is strong, and the action plan in place should yield positive results. The board approved a $1.0 billion increase to the buyback, leaving about 1.6 billion authorization available. International momentum offsets Americas softness Americas revenue declined about 2% with comparable sales down 5 %. The United States fell about 3% and Canada was flat on a constant currency basis. International increased about 33%, with China Mainland up about 46% and comparable sales up 25%. Rest of World grew about 19% with comparable sales up 9%. Digital sales rose 13% to about $1.1 billion, representing 42% of revenue. The company ended the quarter with 796 stores and low double digit square footage growth year over year. By category, men rose 8%, women 6%, and accessories and other 12%. Drivers included strong outerwear demand in China, limited discounting during key platform events, and improved digital merchandising. Headwinds included post Thanksgiving traffic softness in the United States and higher markdowns to clear seasonal inventory. In our view, the most important element for the thesis is the durability of international growth paired with the planned product refresh in North America, which could stabilize comps and support margin quality through improved full price penetration. Tariffs and de minimis removal shift the cost curve A critical theme is the explicit accounting for tariff and de minimis impacts. Management quantified about 190 basis points of full year tariff pressure and about 410 basis points of Q4 gross margin impact, with mitigation through vendor savings, pricing, and distribution network changes. This clarity matters for investors and peers that face similar import cost structures, as it frames the near term margin ceiling and highlights where efficiency gains are most valuable. Valuation In our view, LULU has a solid balance sheet that has a favorable impact on the company’s cost of capital and a positive impact on the valuation of the company. Neither Moody’s nor Standard & Poor’s has a credit rating on the company. However, LULU has $1.0 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, and no debt. LULU’s forward four-quarter price-cash flow is 11.9x compared to the five-year average of 38.1x (five-year high 80.8x, five-year low 10.2x). The industry average from FactSet of 22.1x. The company trades with a trailing four-quarter price/sales ratio of 2.0x compared to the five- year average of 6.6x (five-year high 12.8x, five-year low 1.8x). The industry average from FactSet of 3.3x. LULU’s forward four-quarter © 2025 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. All rights reserved. Lululemon (LULU) | Page 3 P/E is 14.7x compared to the five-year average of 32.6x (five-year high 72.3x, five-year low 12.3x). The industry average from FactSet of 36.8x. In our opinion, LULU deserves to trade at a premium valuation due to its solid growth potential and financial consistency. Investment Thesis We maintain a HOLD rating on Lululemon Athletica as near-term challenges in the U.S. business and leadership uncertainty temper our outlook despite strong international performance and a robust product pipeline. The U.S. market remains a headwind, with comparable sales declining for consecutive quarters and management acknowledging softer traffic and heightened promotional activity. While initiatives to improve product activation and accelerate innovation are underway, these efforts will take time to influence consumer behavior. The company’s plan to increase new style penetration and refresh core franchises is encouraging, but meaningful benefits are expected only in late 2026, leaving North America exposed to competitive pressures and discretionary spending volatility in the interim. International growth, particularly in China, continues to be a bright spot, supported by strong brand resonance and expanding store footprint. Digital penetration remains high, and margin discipline in Q3 demonstrated the company’s ability to partially offset tariff-related costs through pricing actions and vendor negotiations. However, structural cost pressures from tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption will weigh on profitability through 2026, even with ongoing efficiency initiatives. The announced CEO transition adds another layer of uncertainty, in our view. While continuity measures are in place and product decisions for early 2026 are locked, the timing and strategic priorities of the incoming leadership could influence execution risk and investor sentiment. In our view, LULU retains long-term growth potential through international expansion and innovation, but near-term earnings visibility is constrained by U.S. softness, margin pressure, and leadership change. At approximately 14.7x forward EPS, valuation appears reasonable relative to growth prospects, supporting our HOLD rating until clearer evidence of U.S. stabilization and successful execution under new management emerges.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20251215_Ameriprise_Advisor_Services-_Inc._LULU_LULU-_LULU_Q3_Operating_Results.pdf

The analysts’ assessment of these and other factors may produce an Analyst Risk Profile that may differ from the Quantitative Risk Profile. Increased competition and consumer’s trading down to lower priced products is a key risk factor that could impact the LULU’s overall market share. Moreover, rising input costs, inflated labor expenses, and growing property costs add to the company's risk factors. Changes in management could also impact the company's performance significantly. A downturn in consumer spending could cause households to cut back on apparel purchases, leading to a decline in revenue. Similarly, potential pandemics, geopolitical risks like wars or changes in government, and industry regulations could disrupt the company's operations and overall business performance. As with any company, factors like higher taxes, rising interest rates, and currency volatility can adversely affect profits. The company faces the risk of potential product recalls, which not only result in lost revenue but also cause reputational damage. Changing consumer tastes or needs could have a negative impact on the company’s revenue, which requires innovative new product development. © 2025 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. All rights reserved.

We believe it is important for investors to diversify their investments across asset classes, economic sectors and industries in order to help reduce risk. Please consult with your financial advisor to assist in creating a diversified portfolio that is consistent with your investment objectives. Recommended List selections and securities markets in general could experience significant volatility due to several factors, including but not limited to: changes in global economic conditions, movements in interest & foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in commodity prices, geopolitical risks, changes in the regulatory & legislative environment (e.g., regulatory capital requirements, changes in tax rates, Medicare, etc.), catastrophes & natural disasters, labor issues, disruptions in the supply chain, merger integration issues, patent expiration, cybersecurity issues, litigation risks, headline risks, changes in distribution, and the loss of key personnel. For additional information please refer to third party research reports. You may experience a loss of principal by investing in equities. Securities included on our Recommended Lists are selected from the universe of companies covered by AEIS. Approved third party research providers (e.g., CFRA powered by data from S&P Global, Morningstar and Refinitiv/LSEG) generally provide additional information on Recommended List companies. Recommended List selections reflect securities that our analysts believe represent good value based on current conditions. If a security is added to a Recommended List, we deem it to be appropriate for investment. If a security is removed from a Recommended List and you choose to hold the removed security in your investment portfolio, you should continue to review available third party research sources in order to obtain an investment opinion, price target, and additional fundamental analysis. Ameriprise equity ratings definitions Buy Rating – The shares are expected to outperform the analyst’s benchmark (or blended benchmark) over the next 12 months on a total return basis. We believe the company has healthy business prospects and/or attractive valuation metrics that could result in strong performance versus the benchmark. Hold Rating – The common shares are expected to perform in-line with the analyst’s benchmark (or blended benchmark) over the next 12 months on a total return basis. The company has attractive long-term business prospects, but certain near-term issues could result in performance that only matches the benchmark, and shares may be fairly valued at current levels.

Further, mgmt noted continued pressure in the US apparel category, stating “we held share in premium athletic and lost some slight share in the performance apparel as we see guest behavior and trading down from a newness perspective.” Internationally, Mainland China grew +47% constant-currency (accelerating significantly vs. +24% c/c growth in 2Q) driven by an above-plan customer response to the merchandise assortment (outerwear), and earlier start to 11/11 events on 3P ecommerce platforms, and Rest of World grew +19% c/c (> 2Q +15% c/c) maintaining a consistent 2-yr stack.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20251217_JP_Morgan_LULU_lululemon_athletica_inc.-_FY26_P-L_-_CEO_Transition.pdf

Internationally, management’s contemplates China Mainland results moderating to +Mid-Teens c/c ex-53rd week implied growth (vs. 3Q +47% c/c), due to the shift associated with an early start of 11/11 events (benefit to 3Q vs. headwind to 4Q) and 4Q realizes a headwind from a later Chinese New Year). Specifically within the US, management cited expectations for the US in 4Q to realize a “modest” improvement (vs. 3Q’s -3.0% result), citing strength through the Thanksgiving shopping period, with Black Friday product offered to members 1 week earlier YOY as mgmt saw “the opportunity to clear through some seasonal and end of life product” through the higher traffic & value-oriented holiday period (matching our 12/1 Boss’ Holiday Fieldwork in which we flagged LULU black Friday promotions running incremental days Y/Y with “We Made Too Much” / Clearance SKUs in the women’s category +98% YOY by our proprietary tracker). That said, management cited demand trends in the US decelerated post-Black Friday (notably traffic), resulting in a deeper spending trough post-Black Friday than initially expected, & netting to mgmt’s outlook for a “modest improvement” in 4Q US revenues vs. 3Q’s -3% decline. • On gross margin, management guided 4Q gross margins to decline ~580bps Y/Y to 54.6% (vs. Street 54.5%) reflecting a more favorable assumption on net tariff headwinds of -410bps (vs. ~460bps implied prior by our estimates) offset by expectations for increased markdowns of -100bps Y/Y (worse vs. -60bps headwind implied prior). Driving the higher markdowns, management cited higher levels of seasonal clearance, while the overall markdown & promotional strategy remain unchanged with an intent to clear end-of-season products through stores, online, outlets, and warehouse sales. Taking this a step further, 3Q inventories increased +11% Y/Y to $2.0B, w/ inventory units +4% Y/Y, relative to management’s forward revenue guidance of -3% to -1% in 4Q, with mgmt noting expectations for inventories to be in a healthier position into FY26 stating “As we look out to next year, we are planning inventory units below sales. Our aim is to increase full price penetration and utilize our Chase capabilities to minimize markdown risk.” #3: FY26 Operating Margin = “Negatives Outweigh the Positives”: Relative to FY25’s operating margins guided to decline 390bps Y/Y to 19.8%, we are modeling FY26 operating margin degradation of -270bps Y/Y to 17.1% (below the Street at 18.0%) driven by gross margin degradation of -130bps Y/Y (largely tariff-driven) and SG&A deleverage of -140bps Y/Y on our +5.7% revenue growth assumption, with our 17.1% operating margin profile ~520bps below LULU’s pre-pandemic 22.3% profile. Specifically, management cited two incremental 2026 headwinds to consider: (1) incremental net tariff headwinds wrapped into 1H26 (= $70M by our estimates vs. mgmt’s implied $80M headwind prior) & (2) incremental incentive compensation (= $75M by our estimates) – which collectively represent a ~125bps headwind YOY. In addition, we see incremental fixed cost deleverage on our +5.7% revenue growth assumption (vs. Street +4.4%) across Occupancy (implied CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R.

Put together, CFO Frank confirmed “the negative factors will outweigh the positives as we move into FY26” with the “potential” tailwinds being flow-through of improved US revenue growth and improved full-price selling mix (= net result of further operating margin degradation YOY into FY26 vs. FY25’s guided ~19.8% base). Model Implications: We model FY25 EPS of $12.98 (vs. Street $12.85) and FY26 EPS of $12.33 (vs. Street $12.63). Remain Neutral with our $203 Dec ’26 price target based on 16x our FY27 EPS. • CEO Transition Announced: LULU announced that Calvin McDonald, current Executive Officer and member of the company’s Board of Directors, will step down after 8 years at the helm, effective January 31, 2026, and will serve as a senior advisor to the company through March 31, 2026. In addition, Meghan Frank, Chief Financial Officer, and Andre Maestrini, Chief Commercial Officer, will serve as interim co-CEOs following the CEO transition. On timing, management confirmed the Board has begun conducting a “comprehensive search process in partnership with a leading executive search firm” and is focused on a leader with experience in “growth and transformation.” On the go forward strategy, Interim Co-CEO Frank outlined a three pillar action plan (Product Creation, Product Activation and Enterprise Efficiency) to drive an inflection in the business. Digging deeper on each pillar: (1) Product Creation:reiterated expectations for the product assortment reaching the rebalanced mix of 35% newness penetration entering Spring ’26 (mid-to-late-1Q26) which “will continue to strengthen throughout the year”, with Train a focus category within performance in early 2026. Mgmt also cited expectations to reduce the product development process from 18-24 months currently to 12-14 months, and improve speed lanes/chase capabilities (replenishment in strong performing styles within 6-8 weeks). (2) Product Activation: elevating the store experience by improving store-by-store and market-by-market assortment curation, engaging high-value guests in new ways (i.e. Amex partnership & social channel engagement with brand ambassadors), and better aligning brand and market activities with product inflections and drops. (3) Enterprise Efficiency: focus on increasing efficiencies, notably to mitigate pressure to margins from increased tariff costs, including strategic pricing actions, supply chain initiatives (vendor negotiations and DC network efficiency), and enterprise wide savings initiatives. • Boss’ 3Q P/L Breakdown: LULU reported 3Q revenue growth +7% Y/Y (above Street +3.4%), including International revenues +33% Y/Y and Americas revenues -2%. Importantly by category, (i) Women’s grew +5.7% Y/Y (> 2Q +4.8%), (ii) Men’s grew +8.1% (vs. 2Q +6.3%), and (iii) Other/Accessories grew +12.2% (vs. 2Q +14.9%). On margins, LULU reported 3Q GPM decline of -291bps Y/Y to 55.6% (> Street 54.4%) driven by (1) -300bps contraction in product margin due to (i) -290bps from higher markdowns, tariffs and other costs, partially offset by higher pricing and lower product costs, and (ii) -10bps of unfavorable FX, (2) -10bps of fixed cost deleverage.On expenses, 3Q SG&A $s increased +8.7% Y/Y, equating to deleverage of -57bps (> Street -154bps) driven by (i) -110bps deleverage from our operating channel costs, and (ii) -30bps deleverage on D&A, partially offset by (iii) +90bps of leverage from corporate SG&A expenses driven by a reversal of stock-based compensation expense, translating to 17.0% EBIT margins (vs. Street 14.9%). • Balance Sheet Snapshot: LULU ended 3Q with cash & cash equivalents of $1.0B (2Q $1.3B) and no LT debt with $593M available under revolving credit facilities (2Q $393.4M).

On shareholder returns in 3Q, LULU repurchased 1.0M shares for a total cost of $189M with $1.6B remaining under the stock repurchase program authorization (inclusive of the additional $1bn announced).

We rate shares of LULU Neutral. Valuation We raise our Dec ’26 price target to $203 (vs. $191 prior) based on ~16x our revsied FY27 EPS (in line with Non-Distressed retail peers). Risks to Rating and Price Target While LULU has a substantial sq. ft. growth opportunity both domestically and internationally, this comes with risk given the execution and focus needed to efficiently open low-double-digit square footage growth while supporting comp growth through product innovation. In addition, the economic climate, particularly the employment picture, can affect consumer spending and the sportswear industry. A greater-than-expected downturn in household spending could cause sales trends to decelerate below our current assumptions, rendering our estimates too high. Roughly 40% of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the United States, w/ downside risk to our price target if the USD strengthens further & upside risk to our price target if the US and China Mainland accelerate to faster growth vs. our model.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons.

An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. Some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe of the relevant duration of the region. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe.

We view the guidance as a conservative likely setting up for another margin beat in 4Q25. However, Price Performance Exchange-Nasdaq it is FY26 margins and sales that are more concerning as pressure stems from a number of 52 Week range USD 423.32-159.25 headwinds that prevent us from becoming more constructive on LULU shares. These headwinds include: 1) outsized tariff impacts from the repeal of the de minimis exemption, including potential changes to the distribution network; 2) negative comp sales in the Americas mostly due to U.S. challenges; 3) deeper use of promotions; 4) higher spending on foundational investments; and 5) share loss in performance apparel due to consumers trading down. We remain on the sidelines, balancing our cautious view against: 1) still-strong international growth; 2) maintaining market share in premium athletic apparel; and 3) potential for 4Q25 Source: IDC sales upside driven by “buying the comp” on deeper promos, AmEx partnership, and Link to Barclays Live for interactive charting conservative guidance.

Tariff Exposure Update. 3Q25 GM decreased 290bps, driven primarily by tariffs, but also including 90bps of increased markdown pressure. Looking ahead, tariff-related headwinds are expected to weigh on 4Q25 GM by about 410bps, contributing to total GM guidance down 580bps. FY26 estimated tariff pressure of $320mn was not updated from the prior quarter's commentary. Tariff mitigation efforts continue to include strategic pricing actions, vendor negotiations, DC network efficiency, and enterprise wide savings initiatives. Quarter in review. 3Q25 EPS of $2.59 beat consensus of $2.22 as GM of 55.6% beat consensus of 54.4%, although it declined 290bps y/y driven by tariff impacts and higher markdowns. SG&A rate of 38.6% beat consensus of 39.5%, driven by top line leverage and 'prudent' expense management. Net revenue of $2.57bn beat consensus of $2.48bn. By region and on a comparable growth constant currency (cc) basis, Mainland China increased +25% y/y, Rest of World increased +9%, while the Americas declined -5%. The company raised guidance for FY25, seeing EPS in the range of $12.92 to $13.02 (prior guidance $12.77 to $12.97 and vs. consensus $12.89). The FY25 guidance incorporates: net sales of $10.962bn to $11.047bn (from prior guidance $10.85bn to $11.00bn and vs. consensus is $10.96bn); gross margin of ~56.5% (prior guidance ~56.2% and vs. consensus 56.2%); operating margin of ~19.8% (unchanged from prior guidance and vs. consensus ~19.7%); and capex expected to be near the low end of $700mn- $720mn. Management also provided guidance for 4Q25, seeing EPS in the range of $4.66 to $4.76 (midpoint ~5% below consensus $4.97). The guidance incorporates: net sales of $3.500bn to $3.585bn (consensus $3.585bn); gross margin of ~54.6% (consensus 54.7%); and operating margin of ~22.1% (consensus 23.2%). Inventory. Based on our proprietary inventory analysis, LULU has posted three consecutive quarters of negative sales-to-inventory growth. In FY3Q25 the Inventory Management Spread (""IM Spread"") was (812) basis points and improved from (1514) basis points in the prior quarter. LULU's Gross Margin Return on Inventory (""GMROI"") has worsened for three consecutive quarters, and its Operating Margin Return on Inventory (""OMROI"") has worsened for three consecutive quarters. Adjusting estimates, raising PT to $189 from $180. Our FY25, FY26, and FY27 adj. EPS estimates are $13.04, $12.34, and $13.50 (from $12.90, $12.75, and $13.81), respectively, as we flow through the 3Q25 beat, while lowering our sales assumptions assumptions to reflect continued challenges in the U.S. market, along with incremental SG&A deleverage. Our new PT of $189 (from $180) is based on an NTM P/E multiple of 14x (from 13x) applied to our CY27E adj. EPS of $13.50 (from $13.81). We raise our multiple one turn due to the leadership change, identified product ""fixes"" to impact next year, expectations of cleaner inventory in FY26, and lowered consensus expectations. 11 December 2025 2 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc.

Proprietary PRISM Curve: LULU in the TRAP Phase From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 2 and Figure 3 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe LULU has just entered the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises. As market share erodes, the lack of sales is causing operating deleverage. During the TRAP phase, management’s strategy is on the defensive – meaning actions are being taken to change business trends, but the issues have not yet stabilized. Typically, the company has been leading the competitive playing field but above-average profits and growth attract new entrants, creating a more challenging competitive backdrop. FIGURE 2.

Recall, we measure the promo levels in the ""We Made Too Much"" (WMTM) clearance section, and note that during FY3Q25 this section saw a notable increase in depth and frequency for the duration of the quarter. Average WMTM units increased +66% y/y in 3Q25 from +44% in 2Q25. LULU has already guided for GM pressure and our checks show it drove sales and conversion. The continued activity within its WMTM section raises questions about inventory management and full-price sell-through, particularly as the brand navigates challenges in its U.S. stores amidst increasing competition. We note a new American Express platinum promotion beginning 9/18/25 for LULU may provide a lift to comps in the near term. 11 December 2025 9 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. FIGURE 4.

Tariff Exposure Update. 3Q25 GM decreased 290bps, driven primarily by tariffs, but also including 90bps of increased markdown pressure. Looking ahead, tariff-related headwinds are expected to weigh on 4Q25 GM by about 410bps, contributing to total GM guidance down 580bps. FY26 estimated tariff pressure of $320mn was not updated from the prior quarter's commentary. Tariff mitigation efforts continue to include strategic pricing actions, vendor negotiations, DC network efficiency, and enterprise wide savings initiatives. Prior Tariff Commentary. In FY25, tariff related pressure on GM is expected to amount to (220bps), up from prior tariff guidance of (40bps), with most of the heightened impact tied to (170bps) of de-minimis exemption impacts, and the balance attributable to higher underlying country rates. In FY26, the tariff pressure will continue, with an estimated tariff impact of ~$320mn likely to have an outsized impact on 1H26. We note that In LULU's most recent 10-K, the company provided details on its global manufacturing mix by country: ""During 2024, 40% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia, and 7% in Bangladesh, and the remainder in other regions."" 3Q24 Earnings Call 12/5/24: ""We have very limited exposure in China, we source approximately 3% of goods from China.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"": U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a 11 December 2025 22 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.

Strength in international markets, particularly China, and steady gains in men's are key offsets, though the US is likely to remain under pressure. A meaningful turnaround will depend on renewed product innovation and sharper execution under a new CEO, expected in 2026. Supply-chain efficiencies can lend support, yet will likely only partly counter the drag from tariffs and heavier promotions. (12/11/25) Key Topics Summary Near Term Strength:Building sales momentum is key to Lululemon reaching 2026 goals, yet revenue could slow to just 2-4% in 2025 on softer consumer spending amid inflation and tariff concerns. Gross margin might drop 300 bps this year, based on guidance, amid tariff headwinds and higher markdowns. The company's membership program and product innovation can help, with newness key to aiding sales. Regional Growth:Lululemon's sales growth could moderate further in 2025, yet growth needs to accelerate by double digits in 2026 if it wants to double revenue through fiscal 2026 and expand 15% compounded annually from 2021-26. International is at the forefront of the $12.5 billion sales goal and can quadruple as the company expands into new and core markets, led by China and gains in Europe. DTC Catalysts:Lululemon could maintain its store productivity this year while expanding its omnichannel offerings, store footprint and membership programs. Foundational investments across its digital platform to boost traffic, average order value and conversion are core to reaching its goal of doubling digital sales by 2026, with an emphasis on improving inventory accuracy and enhanced storytelling.

Category Expansion:With its science-of-feel strategy, Lululemon aims to double men's sales by 2026 and drive double-digit gains annually in women's. Performance design and fabrics with sustained innovation can find buyers beyond yoga, such as gym enthusiasts and other active people. Product innovation, more men's franchises and expansion in office, travel and commuter are catalysts.

Management's initiatives -- raising new-product penetration toward 35% by spring, enhancing in-store experiences and improving local and strategic product curation -- are sound, though consistent execution is essential to restoring traction. Tariffs will remain a headwind, with guidance for a 410-bp hit to gross margin in 4Q, and continue to weigh into 2026. CEO Calvin McDonald is stepping down in January.

Sales are expected to rise by just 4% in 2025, based on consensus, and could turn negative in 4Q despite product expansion and continued strength in digital and international. Greater adoption of its loyalty program and newness in women's are aimed at helping regain momentum. Gross margin should fall 270 bps from tariffs and higher markdowns.

This may be due to a weaker 2025 outlook amid tariff headwinds, where an acceleration in 2026 is key to meeting its ""Power of Three"" goal. Still, its success in women's and men's apparel and expanded international market share will remain strong. New products for women will be key to gains. Higher markdowns may help clear elevated inventory. Lululemon aims to double its men's and digital sales and quadruple international sales by 2026 from 2021. Lululemon shares were down 46.4% this year through Dec. 12, but have risen recently after better- than-expected 3Q results and a new CEO search. Guidance for the year remains soft.

This is helping build unaided awareness, which reached the mid-to-high teens in 2024 from 9% in 2022, and can be supported by the opening of about 30 international stores in 2025. Most of those will be in China, where sales showed strength in 2Q, up 25%, and could climb 20-25% in 2025. Lululemon has a 5.1% apparel-market share in the country (1.1% in 2019). In 2Q, 16% of its sales came from mainland China. Economic volatility and tariff headwinds are concerns. Robust growth in the region can aid Lululemon's margin, since China typically has the highest profitability, with a 2Q 64% gross margin vs. 62% in the Americas and 54% for the rest of the world. (09/18/25) Mainland China Market-Share Breakdown Gross Margin Can Contract in 2025 Lululemon's gross margin could drop 300 bps in 2025, with 220 bps ($240 million) due to tariffs amid the removal of the de minimis exemption, along with higher markdowns. The company was leveraging the exemption to ship e-commerce orders from its Canada distribution centers into the US. Its removal is a 170-bp headwind, based on guidance. Maintaining healthier inventory is key, given stockpiles rose 21% in 2Q, with units up 13%, which should extend through 2H before moderating in 1Q26. Gross margin fell 110 bps in 2Q on 70 bps of narrower product margin amid higher markdowns and tariffs. This was partially offset by price increases and lower product and ocean-freight costs.

Beauty is the most vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese imports in our coverage, with 75% of its supply chain tied to the country. Toymakers Hasbro and Mattel, which continue to cut exposure to China, are better positioned but will still face margin pressure into 2026 -- even with higher prices and production shifts. Exposure to other countries is mostly lower across the group. Retailers like Best Buy have less direct control than manufacturers over inventory sourced from China or other countries. Still, tariffs and resulting price hikes will pose headwinds for profit through at least 1H, even as indirect exposure to China has dropped to 30-35%.

Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing.

LULU is using this Holiday period to Previous 12.87E 12.20E — clear excess inventory and as such, believes it will be in a good position starting Q1, where management Growth NM NM 9.4% also expects that the impact of new products will begin to be felt (new style penetration expected to be P/E 14.4x 14.9x 13.6x 35% next spring). While trends remain challenged domestically, International comped a strong +18% driven by Mainland China comps up 25%. QTD, LULU noted a strong 11/11 selling period, but a later Lunar New Year will push some sales out of Q4 and into Q1. Tom’s Takeaway #3: Margin Pressure Likely to Persist Through 2026. Gross margin was down 290bps in Q3, which was better than guidance for down 410bps. For Q4, the company expects gross margin to be down 580bps, of which 410bps comes from tariffs/removal of de minimis exemption and 100bps comes from markdowns. This, combined with higher-than-normal marketing expense as the company looks to drive traffic, results in a Q4 EBIT margin that is expected to be down 680bps YoY. Regarding the margin outlook for FY26, management expects the ""negatives to outweigh the positives"" which suggests pressure will continue next year. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 5 OF THIS REPORT. December 12, 2025 At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS LULU is a strong brand with long-term growth drivers, but the operating environment has become more challenging.

Next year, we in worse than expected, and generates macro environment doesn't deteriorate expect slightly positive comps (down negative global comp growth next year any further, leading to a FY25 earnings domestically, up internationally), with (-MSD in North America and slightly beat and a faster re-acceleration of some footage growth resulting in MSD positive overseas). Amid slowing sales and revenues in FY26. In this scenario, we think consolidated revenue growth. We assume the wrap-around of tariffs, we assume FY27 EPS power could be ~$15.00.

In this scenario, FY26 deleverage, resulting in FY26 EPS power EPS declines to below $11.00. Assuming of ~$12.50. With slight margin recovery in the company continues to struggle into FY27 and slight comp sales acceleration, FY27, EPS power could fall further to we think LULU can resume EPS growth, $10.00. At a low-teens P/E multiple, the to the $13.50-$14.00 range. The stock is stock could fall to ~$130. currently trading at ~15x our FY26 EPS forecast of $12.54.

The steeper wholesale-revenue decline of 15% in 2Q sequentially versus 9% in the prior quarter, alongside management's indication of higher subsidies for retail partners such as Topsports and Yue Yuen's Pou Sheng, suggests Nike will keep new product shipments tight into summer 2026 as it clears aged inventory.

Emerging Competition. While competition concerns have always surrounded LULU, there are",9,3,6,"signs that emerging brands are perhaps eating into LULU's dominant position in athleisure. Alo has carved a niche in the premium/fashion segment of athleisure and is opening stores at a significant pace. Vuori is a brand that is beginning to take real market share from LULU in regions such as Southern California (where Vuori is headquartered). We also believe Fabletics is re-accelerating growth to the mid to high teens range. Notably many LULU alums have joined competitors in the past several years, driven by: 1) the changing culture at LULU and 2) a similar ethos to when LULU was in its early days. Further, the increased competition may force LULU to begin spending heavier on marketing, which could weigh on margins—notably LULU's marketing spend as a % of sales (4-5%) is one of the lowest among brands in our coverage (avg. 8-10%). Equity Research | 3 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on LULU shares. Exhibit 1 - The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Source: © iStockphoto.com The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on LULU shares are focused on: (1) LULU implements a stringent re-focus on the US market and overhauls virtually every aspect of the business - driven by a new CEO, (2) international growth (led by MLC) should enable LULU to continue hitting their top-line algo, (3) issues in N. Amer are finally addressed and LULU has already signaled weakness into 2026 - thus lowering the 2H bar; and (4) valuation is at all-time lows and creates a compelling risk/reward. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on LULU shares are likely focused on: (1) their core NA market continues to underperform and is not easily fixed by new management (which will weigh on LULU's industry-leading margins); (2) inventory has become an issue with 20%+ growth exiting each of the last two quarters (1Q25, 2Q25), (3) the business pushes into international markets with higher operating costs, and investors question the trajectory of markdowns go-forward; and (4) competition remains strong, and could pressure margins if LULU needed to ramp their industry-low demand creation dollars (marketing spend). 4 | Equity Research lululemon athletica, inc.

(LULU) Investment Thesis LULU is an industry leader in an attractive market (athletic apparel). We believe the company has ample white space overseas and will continue to post outsized international growth. However, the slowdown in North America along with an ""over earning"" P&L are a concern and keep us cautious over the next 12 months. We are Equal Weight rated. Target Price Valuation for LULU: $175.00 from $160.00 Our $175 price target reflects a 14x FY26E P/E. We believe a discount to history is warranted given that LULU is dealing with merchandising issues domestically, while operating at record margins as competition around them is heating up while US comps are trending negative with margin pressures growing. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for LULU Upside risks (1) SSS accelerate; (2) North America slowdown is not as drastic as expected, and (3) international growth (particularly in China) is better than expected. Downside risks (1) increasing competition within athleisure market; (2) slowing comps, and (3) international growth stalls Companies Mentioned in Report Company Name Ticker Last Price Rating (12/11/25) lululemon athletica, inc.

WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.

Boss, CPA AC (former CFO & COO at Ralph Lauren from 2016-2025), who Elliott sees as a (1-212) 622-2630 potential CEO candidate. Specifically, Nielsen stated “Lululemon is one of the matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com most powerful brands in retail, defined by exceptional products, deeply engaged Amanda K. Douglas communities and significant global potential… I would welcome the chance to (1-212) 622 0316 amanda.douglas@jpmorgan.com discuss this opportunity with the Lululemon board.” Importantly, the WSJ Brady T Arnette reported Nielsen has been working together with Elliott for months (1-212) 622-0046 evaluating the opportunity, including by our work data analysis, store visits, brady.arnette@jpmorgan.com and consumer survey work to assess strategic near-term and multi-year J.P. Morgan Securities LLC opportunities to improve top/bottom-line results. 5 Key Points to the Elliott/Nielsen Playbook By Our Access: • Nielsen as CEO Candidate w/ Talent Opportunity to Follow: With Nielsen previously stating in a Sept ’24 WSJ interview “I’d like to be the CEO of a company” as the next step following her leadership as a COO and CFO at Ralph Lauren (2016-25), CFO of Coach (2011-16), and CFO of PepsiCo Beverages Americas (2009-11), Elliott cited Nielsen as a “retail pro that can help revitalize the Lululemon brand”. To that end, over Nielsen’s 8-year leadership tenure at RL, shares grew 160% (+13% CAGR), with RL’s EPS growing at a +9% CAGR driven by ~400bps of operating margins expansion to 14% as of FY25 (> FY17 10%). To this point, Nielsen’s focus was on foundational work to reset the company’s channel distribution, brand positioning, and full-price selling mix. A key unlock opportunity by our access points to additional potential leadership changes beyond the CEO role at LULU, including Chief Product Officer and Chief Operating Officer, noting Nielsen has shown ability to effectively work with and successfully recruit top talent in the past (i.e. a “long rolodex” for potential candidates). • Customer File Intact w/ Product Improvement Opportunity: A key point flagged by our recent work is that the customer file remains intact still at LULU, while wallet share loss to competition (& therefore conversion rates) has translated to the primary constraint within LULU’s trailing twelve month US revenues (-0.2% Y/Y). To that end, our fieldwork cited Net Promoter Scores at LULU continuing to remain above industry peers by recent survey work, with the shortfall on conversion rates seen as mis-execution across (i) product (lack of newness, while price positioning is seen as appropriate), (ii) merchandising in stores (elevated SKU count resulting in cluttered stores, inventory bloat & reliance upon markdowns), and (iii) marketing (low-ROI brand ambassador investments relative to driving mid-funnel investments, such as localized influencers) weighing on consumer conversion rates.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\lulu_research\20251223_JP_Morgan_LULU_lululemon_athletica_inc.-_Key_Takes_on_the_Elliott-Niels.pdf

Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 18 December 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com wholesale), our work points to Nielsen’s initial focus as likely to relate to improving productivity within the existing North American store footprint (noting International stores under the franchise model are operating better relative to owned/operated DTC N. America doors). To that point, our work points to a key pillar of inflection being led by merchandising improvement, with reinvestment in the existing store fleet (emphasizing small format stores) key in growing wallet share among existing consumers through an improved product presentation (including SKU rationalization efforts) & storytelling/messaging. • Marketing Budget “Optimization” to Focus on Core Consumers: Supporting the product and merchandising opportunity, our work points to a reallocation of existing marketing dollars to more effective brand-building channels as an opportunity under Nielsen’s potential leadership, rather than a deliberate marketing budget expansion beyond FY25’s ~5.5% of sales budget. Said differently, key marketing metrics, such as conversion/clicks, show LULU’s current brand ambassadors and partnerships (outside of LULU’s core TAM) fail to resonate with core customers, with an opportunity instead to redirect spend towards creating dedicated cultural moments & recruiting ambassadors & influencers with both international reach and a local connection to North American markets. • SG&A Efficiency Opportunity to Self-Fund Potential Investments: Rather than a “reset” required on the current operating margin structure (TTM 22.0%, or 19.8% by FY25’s guidance), our industry work points to “low hanging fruit” on corporate expenses, including over $1B in corporate costs as a potential takeout opportunity with non-store headcount increasing by 10,000 over the last 3-4 years, which could provide reinvestment opportunity into other key initiatives without having to reset operating margins at a lower rate. Said differently, more effective spend on marketing, coupled with offensive investments offset by corporate cost efficiencies, could translate to an operating margin structure maintained at the same high-teens to low-20s operating margin rate over time.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"": U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a 18 December 2025 9 Barclays | lululemon athletica inc. company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.

Daily Volume 4,317,136.0 has taken a greater-than-$1 billion stake in the company, and is proposing a candidate to replace outgoing CEO Calvin McDonald. They propose that LULU brings in Jane Nielsen, who we believe would be an extremely strong candidate for the role. Ms. Nielsen is one of the most well-respected and capable executives in the industry, in our opinion. She most recently served as COO and CFO of Ralph Lauren (2016-2024) and was instrumental in the turnaround efforts there. Prior to RL, she was the CFO of Coach Inc. (now Tapestry Inc.) from 2011-2016, where she led a similarly impressive turnaround of the once-flagging Coach brand. Given her immense success at RL and Coach, we think she could help reinvigorate LULU if she were to come aboard. We would note, however, that the problems at RL and Coach were different than what LULU is facing at the moment. Coach and RL were both suffering because of aggressive pushes into downstream distribution (outlets, flash sale sites, off-price, etc.), which stifled margins and diluted the brands' images. LULU, on the other hand, has seen their domestic business struggle more because of product-related mis-steps in an increasingly competitive athleisure space (not because of a deterioration of distribution quality). So, her turnaround experience isn't perfectly aligned with LULU's current ills, but on the bright side, we believe that Coach and RL had much deeper-rooted issues than what LULU is currently facing. Said another way, we believe the degree of difficulty in turning around LULU isn't as high as what Ms. Nielsen faced at either Coach or RL. As of this writing, LULU has not commented on the news. We are eagerly awaiting further developments here. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 4 OF THIS REPORT. December 18, 2025 At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS LULU is a strong brand with long-term growth drivers, but the operating environment has become more challenging. BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS In our bull case we assume that they We're modeling FY25 within current In our bear case, we assume FY25 comes ""right the ship"" in the U.S. and the sales and EPS guidance. Next year, we in worse than expected, and generates macro environment doesn't deteriorate expect slightly positive comps (down negative global comp growth next year any further, leading to a FY25 earnings domestically, up internationally), with (-MSD in North America and slightly beat and a faster re-acceleration of some footage growth resulting in MSD positive overseas). Amid slowing sales and revenues in FY26. In this scenario, we think consolidated revenue growth. We assume the wrap-around of tariffs, we assume FY27 EPS power could be ~$15.00. At a margins decline 200-250bps due to discounting increases, and the company high-teens P/E multiple, the stock could be the wrap-around of tariffs, incremental experiences ~350bps of EBIT margin ~$270. markdown pressure, and fixed-cost erosion next year. In this scenario, FY26 deleverage, resulting in FY26 EPS power EPS declines to below $11.00. Assuming of ~$12.50. With slight margin recovery in the company continues to struggle into FY27 and slight comp sales acceleration, FY27, EPS power could fall further to we think LULU can resume EPS growth, to $10.00. At a low-teens P/E multiple, the the $13.50-$14.00 range. stock could fall to ~$130. COMPANY DESCRIPTION LULU is a women's focused athleisure brand headquartered in Vancouver, Canada.

Reported 1Q sales rose 1%, with those in North America, EMEA and APLA returning to gains, while Greater China's remained weak. For the year, tariffs may be a $1.5 billion headwind, up from $1 billion previously, and pose a 120-bp hit to gross margin (75 bps prior).

Rising Tariffs Are Headwinds; 2H Will Have Higher Prices,54,22,22,"A 30% tariff on Chinese goods during the 90-day pause remains well below the 145% imposed prior, offering some relief, but still adds costs for retailers, curbing margins. As tariffs in other countries rise beyond the 10% implemented during the pause, challenges in 2H will intensify, potentially triggering additional sourcing changes once new levies are finalized.

Athleisure Brands Can't Outrun Higher Tariffs; Costs to Rise,55,22,22,"Contributing Analysts Abigail Gilmartin (Retail) Footwear and Athleisure companies' greater production exposure to South Asian countries, particularly Vietnam, put their margins at risk given the addition of tariffs higher than the 10% pause rate. Though companies may be able to mitigate some of the risk via price increases and supplier negotiations, higher costs appear unavoidable and will likely still be a drag to margins. Nike sources about 50% of its footwear from Vietnam and On over 90%. Steve Madden, HeyDude and Skechers, which source more than 40% from China, face greater risks, though they're likely able to quickly adjust their supply chains. Ending the de minimis exemption for China levels the playing field by targeting low-cost Chinese sellers like Temu and Shein, which might have to raise prices. Bulk shipping via PDD and Alibaba could offset some costs. (08/01/25) This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

Beauty is the most vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese imports in our coverage, with 75% of its supply chain tied to the country and limited options to quickly diversify or share costs with retailers.

Inditex, with its midrange pricing, supply-chain flexibility and low China exposure, appears best placed to raise prices yet needs it the least vs. value retailers H&M, Primark, Asos and Boohoo, which are constrained by the need to keep prices low. H&M began shifting sourcing in late 2024 to cut its China exposure, yet is holding denim and basics prices to stay competitive. JD Sports is uncertain about brand partners' mitigation plans, but price hikes appear likely.

North America will remain the company's largest segment, though sales there may fall by low- double digits in fiscal 2025, outpacing expected declines in the Greater China and the Asia Pacific Latin America units. Greater breadth of products at its wholesale partners may boost sales in that segment, which comprises more than half of revenue.

China's 20% reciprocal tariff -- comparable with many trading partners -- offers modest relief to retailers after prior rates of up to 145%. The lower rate narrows cost disparities, but levies still pressure margins and supply chains. India's 50% duty is a growing concern for companies with greater sourcing exposure. Vertically integrated retailers are most vulnerable due to limited cost sharing, while large brands and online platforms may better absorb added costs given their size, efficiency and diversified sourcing. Tariffs can still fluctuate, leaving retailers cautious with guidance amid persistent uncertainty. Some may still have to selectively raise prices to offset higher import costs.

Athleisure Brands Can Outrun Higher Tariffs,60,25,25,"Contributing Analysts Abigail Gilmartin (Retail) Footwear and athleisure companies' bigger production exposure to South Asia, particularly Vietnam, puts their margins slightly at risk from reciprocal tariffs. Yet added costs can be partly offset through supplier negotiations and modest price hikes. Nike sources about 50% of its footwear from Vietnam, while On relies on the country for more than 90%. Steve Madden and HeyDude, which get over half of their supply from China, also face potential pressure, but might quickly adjust supply chains. Ending the de minimis exemption for China could level the playing field by targeting low-cost sellers like Temu and Shein, which may have to raise prices. Bulk shipping via PDD and Alibaba can offset some effects. Retailers like Lululemon could be negatively affected, given its distribution centers in Canada.

Beauty is the most vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese imports in our coverage, with 75% of its supply chain tied to the country and limited options to quickly diversify or share costs with retailers. Toymakers Hasbro and Mattel, which continue to cut exposure to China, are better positioned but will also face margin pressure in 2H through 2026. That's even with higher prices and shifts in production or sourcing. Exposure to other countries is mostly lower across our coverage. Retailers like Best Buy have less direct control than manufacturers over inventory sourced from China or other countries. Still, tariffs and resulting price hikes will be a headwind for profit in 2H and in 2026, even as indirect exposure to China has dropped to 30-35%.

Home Depot, Lowe's Well Positioned to Navigate Tariffs",62,26,27,"Contributing Analysts Drew Reading (Homebuilders) Home Depot and Lowe's size and sourcing diversification in the past several years have them positioned to navigate tariff uncertainty. Home Depot sources a majority of its products from the US and no single country will account for more than 10% of purchases in the next year. Lowe's gets 60% of products from the US, with China accounting for roughly 20% of purchasing volume. Both retailers will keep diversifying, while taking a portfolio approach to pricing. Floor & Decor has also diversified away from China, with 18% of products sold coming from the country vs. 50% in 2018. It plans to reduce this to mid- to low single digits by year-end.

Tariffs Hit Retail Apparel Margin in 2H, 2026",63,27,27,"Contributing Analysts Mary Ross Gilbert (Retail) Most apparel brands, including Gap, Abercrombie, Victoria's Secret, American Eagle and Ralph Lauren, are shifting production away from China, where tariffs dropped to 20% from 30% effective Nov. 10, toward lower-cost regions such as Vietnam (20%), Cambodia (19%), Indonesia (19%) and Bangladesh (20%). These moves will influence margins through the rest of 2H and into 1H26, even after mitigation. Ralph Lauren stands out, as stronger sales and higher average prices more than offset tariff pressure. A 50% levy on India-made goods could pressure apparel margins. Abercrombie may be most exposed, with India, Vietnam and Cambodia making up 69% of sourcing, potentially cutting margins by over 200 bps this year. Gap, which sources 46% from Vietnam and Indonesia, expects a $150-$175 million hit (100-110 bps) after mitigation.

Tariffs Mostly Passed On, Hit Swiss-Made Most in Top-Luxury Rank",64,27,28,"Contributing Analysts Deborah Aitken (Consumer Products) & Andrea Ferdinando Leggieri (Consumer Products) High gross margins among heritage luxury made-in-Europe brands Hermes, Prada and Brunello Cucinelli make them well placed to absorb US tariffs, with their low cost-of-goods structure limiting the price hikes needed for high-spending consumers. Our scenario suggests mid-single- digit US price hikes are sufficient to offset the levies. By contrast, the likes of Burberry, Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Pandora and Zegna are leaning on more cost cuts as a partial offset. Swiss-based watchmakers Richemont, Rolex and Swatch face steep tariffs for now, and with escalating precious-metal costs will need to share greater pricing exposure, pressuring margins.

Retailers' Cautious Price Hikes Fall Short of 10-15% Needed,65,28,28,"Contributing Analysts Tatiana Lisitsina (Retail) European retailers have only recently begun to raise prices in response to US tariffs, and margin recovery will likely be partial. Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing. Management tone remains cautious, signaling the tariff hit is building and not yet peaked.

L'Oreal, Estee Local-Made Softens Tariff Hit, Puig Pricing Helps",67,29,29,"Contributing Analysts Deborah Aitken (Consumer Products) & Andrea Ferdinando Leggieri (Consumer Products) Beauty companies have raised prices globally to offset tariffs by a low single-digit percentage --- plus 1-3% in the US -- without denting volume, helped by localized production and the solid launch pipelines of new innovations (led by fragrance and derma skincare). Estee Lauder and L'Oreal's 70%-plus gross margins, fed by low cost-of-goods models, explains their smaller hikes. Puig faces a larger mismatch, given its greater mix of high-end fragrances imported from Europe, but has stronger pricing power vs. most other categories. Coty has struggled to rely solely on pricing, due to weaker US mass-market demand and its launch-pipeline gaps. Cost-cutting could help, but Ebit stays pressured. Premium brands with market-share leadership have bargaining power to pass on some tariff costs to suppliers and retailers, if required.

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.

Management’s 2Q",3,3,7,"revenue outlook calls for a negative low-single-digit reported revenue decline Y/Y (i.e. -2% at the midpoint), inclusive of an anticipated ~100bps tailwind from FX rates. This represents a ~300bps sequential deterioration relative to 1Q reported revenue growth of +1% driven by (in rank order): (i) a more significant Digital revenue headwind (vs. 1Q) cycling elevated promotional activity & off-price mix of sales in the digital channel from the prior year during the BTS/Holiday season, (ii) a more significant headwind associated w/ Dunks franchise management actions (which overlaps on the Digital headwind), and (iii) ~100bps less of an FX tailwind sequentially (+100bps guided tailwind in 2Q vs. +200bps benefit to 1Q revenue growth). In addition, management noted the 2Q outlook reflects a macroeconomic backdrop as observed today across regions (including indications of macro volatility across Europe, China, and some countries in APLA). To that end, management’s 2Q revenue outlook by our work solely embeds the sequential headwinds associated with Digital, Dunks, and FX (= collective ~300bps sequential drag by our estimates) and the current macroeconomic backdrop. • To this point - representing incremental potential upside relative to 2Q’s “baseline” -LSD% revenue guidance, CFO Friend cited “excitement” internally built across 4 additional revenue drivers: (i) the Sport Offense operating model (only just activated in early September), (ii) NKE ACG (w/ Radical Air apparel & the ACG Ultrafly launched across Apparel/Footwear in the Outdoor category), (iii) NikeSkims (launched last week with 58 silhouettes & “very strong” early consumer response), and (iv) expanded distribution in North America – each of which are not embedded to “incrementally” contribute in 2Q (vs. 1Q) by our work. #2: . . . w/ ""Move To Offense"" Opportunity into 2H26: On the 1Q call, CEO Hill stated “we are more confident than ever that our Win Now actions are the right path forward,” with tangible progress made against the Win Now priorities set 11 months ago across culture, product, brand marketing, marketplace and the ground game, notably in the areas prioritized first: North America (+4% c/c in 1Q > TTM -8% c/c), Wholesale (+5% c/c in 1Q > TTM -6%) w/ Spring orderbooks “Up”, and Running (+20% in 1Q > 4Q +HSD%). On the balance of Win Now actions, management is focused on furthering progress against China, Digital, and Sportswear businesses (Dunks). Representing the inflection in the organization to “offense” (vs. “defense” through Win Now inventory liquidation efforts) – CEO Hill stated the company’s Sport Offense operating model was just activated in early September, which involved the entire organization flipped to be aligned on product creation & marketing by brand, by sport, by country, and by channel (vs. previously the organization structured in an aggregated Gender Construct of Men’s, Women’s, and Kids). As a result, management sees the Sport Offense model enabling small, cross- functional teams category deep to gain sharper insights from the consumers/athletes in each segment to drive consumer connectivity across the entire marketplace and enhance NKE’s competitive edge. To that end, CEO Hill cited “sports offense will maximize NIKE’s complete portfolio. It is designed to drive growth across all our dimensions. We believe the opportunity to serve so many athletes across sports with three distinct brands in retail channels at every price point is an advantage that no one else has in our industry.” • Drilling down by category – management noted Running up +20% c/c in 1Q (> +HSD % in 4Q) “provides an early window into the kind of impact we expect out of Sports Offense,” with the Running team translating athlete needs for cushion, stability, or an energy-driving everyday sneaker through the redesigned franchises of Vomero, Structure, and Pegasus, presenting across the marketplace in a clear 9-box framework across the 3 different franchises & 3 different price points; see our Boss’ Eye: Recent Fieldwork Flags 3 Tiered Product & Distribution Progress; Remain Overweight. To that CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 01 October 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com point, management sees the framework enabling for at least one new major running footwear style each season (= continued newness and innovation). Building off the execution in Running – management sees the Sports Offense foundation translating across Global Football next (= World Cup ’26 catalyst supported by a full refresh across all 3 football boots across Phantom, Tiempo in 3Q, and Mercurial in 4Q across 3 different price points), in addition to Basketball, Training, and Sportswear over-time, and across NKE’s non-traditional sport categories (i.e., Outdoor with NKE ACG, NikeSkims, and Tennis as examples). • Quantitatively - management did not provide 2H26 revenue guidance, though CFO Friend confirmed 2Q would face the “peak” of revenue headwinds associated with both Digital and Dunks, with a more comparable full-price selling Y/Y comparison in Digital beginning in Jan/Feb (3Q25) and with Win Now actions beginning to effect change on Dunks in 3Q25 onwards. Further, management cited momentum continues to build with wholesale partners, noting Spring orderbooks “Up” relative to prior year (consistent w/ Holiday orderbooks “up”) and led by Sport categories, with FY26 wholesale revenue to return to modest growth. Representing a headwind on the other hand, CFO Friend reiterated expectations to see a modest 2H26 revenue headwind across both Wholesale (outsized sales to Value channel) and Direct (outsized unit-driven growth) lapping aggressive clearance activity in the prior year, noting Direct is not expected to return to growth in FY26. Put together – we see incremental potential upside to our current 2H26 model at -2% constant currency - commensurate with our 2Q revenues -2% c/c, with our model assuming a net wash of (i) lessening headwinds associated with Digital/Dunks in 2H (vs. 2Q) offset by (ii) the incremental “modest headwind” on the lap of liquidation actions in the prior year. Importantly, our model reflects zero benefits in 2H26 revenues (vs. 2Q) associated with the inflection to the Sport Offense operating model. #3: Breaking Down The Gross Margin Puts/Takes: Management guided 2Q gross margins to decline -300-375bps Y/Y (below Consensus -230bps Y/Y) inclusive of ~175bps headwinds associated with tariffs (based on current rates today) & ongoing “Win Now” actions to liquidate inventories across regions (with greater work still required in Greater China & Dunks notably). Importantly, 2Q’s gross margin excluding the 175bps tariff headwind equates to a -125bps to -200bps decline, sequentially improving by +60bps underlying (vs. 1Q gross margins down 220bps excluding tariffs) driven by improved full- price selling mix (w/ North America in 1Q already realizing a reduction in the number of days of sitewide promotion on Nike Digital by more than 50, lower markdown rates, and increasing share of demand at full price). Looking ahead to 2H26, CFO Friend cited gross margin tailwinds expected from improved full-price selling mix as NKE laps outsized inventory liquidation actions in the prior year (~210bps ASP headwind to 2H25 & ~80bps inventory obsolescence headwind to 2H25) relative to headwinds associated with (i) mix associated with product/channel (shift to Performance/Wholesale relative Lifestyle/ DTC), and (ii) tariffs (~100bps 2H26 gross margins headwind vs. ~50bps previously implied guidance) with a net tariff headwind of -120bps anticipated for the full year (vs. -75bps prior), and (iii) continued Win Now actions against China & Converse. Importantly, while mix, tariffs, and China/Converse headwinds are expected to “mute” the benefit associated with improved full price selling, CFO Friend clarified a 2H26 gross margin guidance was not explicitly stated (i.e., “mute” effect should not be interpreted as “Flat” YOY gross margin guidance). • Putting the pieces together: we see incremental potential upside to our 2H26 gross margins +15bps YOY (vs. our prior model +33bps Y/Y & below Consensus modeling +120bps YOY) with recapture of inventory obsolescence charges YOY and improved full price selling YOY partially offset by the aforementioned structural headwinds (channel/product mix) and ~100bps tariff drag (~50bps worse vs. prior).

Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 01 October 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com #4: SG&A Leverage Opportunity Multi-Year: On expenses, management guided 2Q SG&A $ growth up HSD% y/y, with accelerated demand creation investments partially offset by tighter operating overhead expense management (guided +LSD% y/y), equating to ~330bps of deleverage to 35.7% of sales (vs. Street 34.0%). For the full year, management reiterated expectations for FY26 SG&A dollars to grow +LSD% y/y (vs. Street +1.6%). Importantly, within the path of operating margins returning to double-digits over- time (vs. 5.6% in FY26E on our model), CFO Friend cited a return to organic revenue growth will drive operating leverage on supply chain costs, retail overhead expenses, and on general operating overhead. More specifically, CFO Friend characterized the current Demand Creation budget (as % of sales) at ~10% of sales as having stabilized, while Operating Overhead at ~25% of sales was characterized as “too high” (vs. pre-pandemic 22.9% of sales for perspective). To that end, management noted operating overhead expenses will continue to be managed tightly (evidenced by 1Q dollars Flat Y/Y), even in the context of Sport Offense. Put together, our model reflects SG&A leverage of ~110bps annually in FY27/28 on +5% revenue growth, with ~15bps of Demand Creation leverage annually to 10.2% of sales by FY28 (vs. 10.5% in FY26E), and ~95bps of Operating Overhead leverage annually to 23.1% of sales by FY28 (vs. 25.0% in FY26). #5: Double Digit Underlying Operating Margin Structure Intact Into FY27: Our model points to a FY26E operating margin of 5.6%, reflecting a ""peak"" impact associated with (i) transitory headwinds from Win Now actions, (ii) fixed cost deleverage (notably on 2-yr stacked revenues -10% Y/Y), (iii) tariff headwinds (-120bps headwind to FY26), and (iv) channel, product, and regional mix headwinds. That said, a key takeaway from our follow up with CFO Friend is that there are no “incremental” margin constraints to consider into FY27 (vs. FY26’s base year) outside of the macro environment as a variable. Said differently, while NKE needs to execute against driving organic growth & improved full price realization (both of which could be impacted by the macro backdrop), our work points to no structural impediments beyond FY26’s base year for operating margins to return to double-digits as revenue volumes recover over time, with management affirming mix headwinds & Win Now actions as FY26 headwinds w/ no “incremental” pressure to consider into FY27+. Key Incremental Mgmt Follow-Up Takeaways: • 1Q Revenue Outperformance vs. Street Across All Geographies: NKE reported 1Q revenues +1.0% Y/Y (above Street -4.8% Y/Y) comprised of Direct sales -5% c/c (sequentially accelerating relative to 4Q at -14% c/c), including Digital -12% Y/Y (vs. 4Q -26% Y/Y), and wholesale +5% c/c (> 4Q at -9% c/c). Management remained “encouraged” by the progress made in rebalancing Sportswear and Performance, with running (+20% growth y/y vs HSD% y/y 4Q) and training key category outperformers, while Classic franchises continued to decline. Digging deeper from a regional perspective: (i) North America revenues grew +4 % y/y c/c (> 4Q -11% c/c) with Nike Direct down -3% (w/ Digital -10% and Stores Flat) Y/Y and Wholesale growing +11% with newness gaining scale across the marketplace, (ii) EMEA revenues+1% c/c (> 4Q -10% c/c) with Nike Direct down -6% (comprised of Digital down -13% and Nike Stores +1%) and wholesale +4%, (iii) APLA revenues +1% c/c (> 4Q -3% c/c) due to Nike Direct declining -6% with Digital down -8% and Stores -8%, and Wholesale growing +5%, while (iv) Greater China revenues declined -10% c/c (> 4 Q’s -20% c/c decline) comprised of Nike Direct down -12% (> 4Q -15% c/c) and wholesale down -9% Y/Y (> 4Q’s -24%) with traffic remaining challenged, seasonal sell-through underperformance and a highly promotional environment, • 1Q26 Operating Margin Beat on GPM & SG&A Rate Favorability: On margins, 1Q EBIT margin declined -252bps to 7.9% (above Street 4.5%) with the beat primarily driven by (i) better-than-expected SG&A rate of 34.3% (< Street 37.2%), with SG&A $’s down -0.8% Y/Y, including operating overhead expenses -0.9% Y/Y due to higher wage- CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 01 October 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com related expense, offset by lower other administrative costs, while demand creation contracted -3% Y/Y due to lower brand marketing expense reflecting higher investment in key sports events in the prior year, partially offset by higher sports marketing expense in the current year, in addition to (ii) 1Q GPM -320bps Y/Y (above Street -350bps) driven by higher discounts in factory stores and Wholesale, supply chain cost deleverage, and channel mix headwinds. • Balance Sheet Snapshot: NKE ended 1Q w/ $7.0B of cash and equivalents & short-term investments against $8.0B in long-term debt. On shareholder returns, NKE paid total dividends of $591M and repurchased 1.8M shares for $123M. On inventories, NKE exited the quarter w/ total inventory -2% Y/Y (vs. revenue +1% reported), reflecting a decrease in units and partially offset by increased product costs primarily due to North America tariff costs. Specifically, 1Q’s inventory growth stood 300bps below reported revenue growth (vs. a +1,200bps spread at 4Q-end), with CFO Friend citing steady progress made to achieve a healthy and clean marketplace by the end of 1H26. By region, management noted EMEA is the furthest along region in cleaning the marketplace, followed by “meaningful progress” cited in N. America, while further work is required to reset the marketplace in Greater China (even after taking “aggressive actions” in 4Q) and APLA (where mgmt stated “pockets of elevated inventory requiring higher levels of promotional activity”).

(Overweight; Price Target: $100.00) Investment Thesis NKE is the global athletic market leader with diversification across product categories, geographies, and distribution, and we see the model at an inflection for revenue growth to re-accelerate into 2H26/FY27 following several quarters of franchise product lifecycle management & inventory liquidation headwinds. Further, we see opportunity for NKE to recapture over 500bps of operating margin erosion on improved full-price selling & reception to new product innovation and as NKE begins to leverage on SG&A expenses with an inflection to topline growth. Valuation We are raising our Dec ’26 Price Target to $100 (vs. $93 prior) based on 37.5x our CY27 EPS of $2.67 (w/ 37.5x = NKE’s historical 2x PEG on our forward High-Teens EPS Growth). Risks to Rating and Price Target The economic climate, particularly the employment picture, can affect consumer spending and the sportswear industry. A greater-than-expected downturn in household spending could cause sales trends to decelerate below our current assumptions rendering our estimates too high. Roughly 50% of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the United States, w/ downside risk to our price target if the USD strengthens further. With the company’s exposure to manufacturing in Southeast Asia, trade policy changes notably in Vietnam could render our estimates too high should NKE not be able to mitigate against tariff related costs.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. Some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe of the relevant duration of the region. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P.

The revamp can bolster consumer engagement through innovation and new products, reviving momentum in running and lifestyle. Fiscal 2026 sales may only modestly exceed analyst expectations, but we project nearly $1 billion in sales upside for 2027. CEO Elliott Hill’s product track record and the Nike-SKIMS launch should help reinforce momentum. Original Thesis (April 2024): Nike's sportswear lead can dominate the channel through product innovation and sports, which could end more than two years of downward earnings-estimate revisions and drive fiscal 2026 revenue at least $1 billion ahead of consensus. The return of major sporting events, accelerated innovation and expectations for upbeat forecasts at its analyst meeting in 2H are catalysts.

Until then, the launch of the Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 running shoes, Kobe Protro, 24.7 apparel collection and expansion of the Air franchise are early signs that the company is making progress freshening its lineup. Expanded involvement in sports around the world and continued initiatives in women and wholesale remain factors that could aid fiscal 2H26 sales and put 2027 revenue above MODL consensus of $48.9 billion. A new brand in collaboration with Skims is an added opportunity. Economic and geopolitical headwinds remain risks.

With downward revisions ebbing, projections can begin to reflect fiscal 2026 improvements. We expect a slight upside to consensus for fiscal 2026 sales on a stronger 2H, while 2027 sales could reach $50 billion.

Innovation Push Needed to Jump-Start Sales,5,2,3,"Rising expenses to create new products and fuel innovation can help Nike increase brand buzz and drive longer-term sales growth. Such costs as a portion of revenue have started to climb and still top pre-pandemic levels of almost 10%, with fiscal 2025 reaching 10.1%. Early initiatives from the recent launch of the Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 shoes and expansion of the Air franchise, with a new innovation platform coming in fiscal 2026, can bring newness to the assortment. This is key as the company works to pare its classic franchises as a portion of the total footwear mix by 10 percentage points, with its Air Force One inventory already normalizing. The new NikeSKIMS collaboration, launched in late September amid tariffs, is a big opportunity to capture share in women's and build sales.

NKE reported FY1Q26 EPS of $0.49 (vs. consensus/Barclays of $0.28/$0.35), as its SG&A rate materially beat at 34.3% of sales (vs. cons. 37.1%) due to lower demand creation expense and a top-line beat.

In FY1Q26 the Inventory Management Spread (""IM Spread"") was 220 basis points and improved from (1055) in the prior quarter. NKE's Gross Margin Return on Inventory (""GMROI"") has worsened for five consecutive quarters, and its Operating Margin Return on Inventory (""OMROI"") has worsened for five consecutive quarters. Lowering estimates but raising multiple and PT to $70 (was $65). Our FY26, FY27, and FY28 adj. EPS estimates are $1.35, $2.19, and $2.65, respectively, down from $1.59, $2.27, and $2.72, driven by lower GM. Our PT of $70 (from $65) is based on 29x (was 26x) applied to our CY27 EPS estimate of $2.43 (from $2.50). We raise our multiple 3 turns due to a positive sales to inventory inflection supporting GM improvement. 30 September 2025 2 Barclays | Nike, Inc.

Proprietary PRISM Curve: NKE Fundamentals Are Bottoming From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of a potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 1 and Figure 2 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe NKE is in the latter stage of the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises. As market share erodes, the lack of sales is causing operating deleverage. During the TRAP phase, management’s strategy is on the defensive – meaning actions are being taken to change business trends, but the issues have not yet stabilized. The ESCAPE Phase We look for evidence that NKE will transition into the ESCAPE phase in FY2H26 in which issues have been identified and are being proactively corrected. At some point, a company’s management makes the changes necessary to correct problems at the business, and the company passes the negative-to-positive inflection point. During the ESCAPE phase, management’s strategy is on the offense. They are actively taking measures to stem losses and stabilize market share. They are focused on driving full-price, healthy sales and likely will have ratcheted back inventory; they are less focused on their competitors’ actions or the environment around them. Typically, a company will move past this point by driving comps with better merchandising and improved inventory management (growing inventory below sales plan). At this point, a company is not yet showing direct signs that fundamentals are currently improving; instead, it is showing signs that fundamentals are stabilizing and are becoming “less bad.” Management is willing to make difficult strategic decisions, and fundamentals are likely to begin improving in the near future. As the company moves further to the right, it is continuing to comp negatively, but less so, and begins to show marginal signs of improvement. During the ESCAPE phase, we typically see a margin recovery before we see a return to sustainable positive sales growth. 30 September 2025 6 Barclays | Nike, Inc. FIGURE 1.

Tariff Exposure Update. Based on the new reciprocal tariff rates, NKE raised its expected impact from tariffs on an annualized gross incremental cost basis to approx. $1.5bn (up from $1.0bn). The company expects the net headwind to GM to increase to 120bps (from 75bps) for FY26, with a 175bps impact to FY2Q26. The company continues to expect to mitigate these new costs over time. Prior tariff commentary. On the FY4Q25 call, NKE stated, ""Currently, China represents roughly 16% of the footwear we import into the United States. And we expect this to reduce to the high single-digit range by the end of fiscal '26, with supply from China reallocated to other countries around the world."" Management estimates FY26 unmitigated tariff expense at the current 30% China/10% rest of world to be $1b with a net impact of ~100 bps to FY1Q26 and ~75 bps to FY26. Additionally, over time the company expects to be able to fully mitigate the $1b impact through several mitigation strategies, including: 1) optimizing its sourcing mix and allocating production differently across countries; 2) partnering with suppliers and retail partners to mitigate structural cost increases; 3) price increases in the U.S. (beginning fall 2025); and 4) corporate cost reductions. Recall, based on its FY24 annual filings ""for fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia, and China manufactured approximately 50%, 27% and 18% of total NIKE Brand footwear (Figure 4), respectively. For fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam, China, and Cambodia manufactured approximately 28%, 16% and 15% of total NIKE Brand apparel (Figure 5), respectively."" Barclays Tariff ""QuikCalc"" Model assumptions. We update our Tariff ""QuikCalc"" model analysis, which now assumes global tariff assumptions effective 8/7/25, resulting in an incremental ~$500m in gross tariff impact to FY26. Our prior tariff analysis assumed 30% China and 10% Rest of World (excluding Mexico and Canada). Note our estimate of Tariff on Goods Imported to the US is a gross unmitigated amount for a full year, and we calculate the price increase necessary to mitigate full tariff cost (absent other mitigation strategies). Our updated tariff calculator under 8/7/25 effective rates suggests that for NKE total average unit cost will increase by 8.3% with pass-through to the US market only increasing prices by 7.9% (see Figure 3). 30 September 2025 8 Barclays | Nike, Inc.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251007_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY1Q26_Review-_One_Step_Closer....pdf

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"": U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.

One of the first things CEO Hill spoke about in this regard is the culture. While this is a fairly broad statement, Hill elaborated on his view that ""culture"" is about several key dynamics that need to be in place in order to drive the Nike brand - putting sport back at the center of everything they do, taking insights from their athletes and turning that into great product and improving storytelling behind their consumer led marketplace (with Direct and Wholesale working together). Elaborating further, over the years NKE had shifted to a mentality of a tech company vs. sports company. Too much reliance on data and analytics which was a mistake. This led to poor decision-making and created the current marketplace issues that exist today. ""We’ve been in this situation before and will work our way through it over time."" Certainly not pleased with their financial performance over the past few years, Hill has stated that the strategy was off, execution was off and while the organization did put a number of actions into place 12+ months, he believes there remains several areas where they simply need to move faster.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251007_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Solid_1Q_Beat_w-_Puts_and_Takes_Go_Fwd-_-60_PT-_Sid.pdf

Notably, they are shifting back towards having the mentality of a sports company (and away from a tech company) with a greater focus on art vs. science. 2) Shifting into sport-led teams (which move at a faster pace) to accelerate a complete product portfolio across 10 different sports spanning footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories (and analyzing how growth in each separate category rolls up to the total company) — with opportunities not only from product innovation but also merchandising. 3) Shifting investments back towards creating demand for brands (with demand creation close to 10% of revenue) by creating strong marketing stories and emotionally connecting with consumers during important sports moments and product launches—with the teams currently building anticipation for new launches and shifting spend from performance marketing to brand marketing. 4) Building back the integrated marketplace, after it was de-prioritized due to a focus on digital revenue, and managing inventory across the marketplace by liquidating aged inventory to create space to sell new assortments and innovation coming in Fall and Holiday",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251007_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Solid_1Q_Beat_w-_Puts_and_Takes_Go_Fwd-_-60_PT-_Sid.pdf

China Has Shifted From Key Tailwind to Ongoing Headwind. After several years of very strong,9,3,3,"growth China has slowed materially post-COVID on a number of issues. Local companies like Anta and Li Ning have raised their own game in terms of sneaker technology, are able to price well below Nike—as Nike is still seen as a premium brand—and have benefited from a cultural shift to China-centric companies. At the same time newer competitors like On and Hoka have also captured share in China from NKE, similar to the US and Adidas is also outperforming NKE near term as well, following their own marketplace inventory cleanup recently. This is compounded by NKE's lack of newness and over-saturation of core retro styles.

Financial Headwinds Expected to Persist in the NT. There is more work to do to return to healthy,10,3,5,"inventory levels across 3 key franchises. Notably, despite a material pullback in FY24 (~MSD revenue headwind, or $2-3B in lost sales), this will likely lead to ongoing -DD declines in key franchises through FY26 as they work their revenue base back to ""normal"" (AF1/AJ1). However, Dunk is likely the most challenged line on current sell-through rates, and could see much more material declines in the revenue base. Additionally, there are expected to be short-term challenges on mix as bringing innovation to market creates a temporary headwind, with momentum in wholesale (away from direct) also creating a negative margin shift. For context on just how much pressure NKE has gone through the past few years—Street EPS estimates have been in a negative revision cycle for 24 months, as FY26 EPS has gone from ~$4.50 all the way down to $1.85 into the 4Q print. The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Equity Research | 3 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on NKE shares. Exhibit 1 - The Bull vs Bear ""Tug of War"" The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on NKE shares are focused on: (1) favorable risk-reward— NKE remains one the strongest softlines brands in the space that, while experiencing some transitory challenges, still has the key long-term opportunities intact; (2) ""new"" CEO Elliot Hill is aggressively cleaning inventory and removing stale product from the market, (3) numbers have been reset and sentiment remains low; and (4) with marketplace inventories eventually clean NKE can refocus on growth, now driven internally through sport - which allows for focused innovation, marketing and community connection. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on NKE shares are likely focused on: (1) NT outlook to remain choppy—global demand very different across geographies and each on separate timelines; (2) China is structurally challenged with headwinds persisting longer than expected; (3) NT issues exacerbated by strong competitors such as ON and HOKA in the US and local brands in China (along with recent strength by Salomon and Arc'Teryx; and (4) global sport and fitness has transitioned more towards trail running and outdoor sport relative to ""indoor"" sports where NKE has historically found success. Financial Outlook FY26E: Our FY26E EPS estimate is raised to $1.60 (from $1.45) representing EPS -26.3%. We are projecting total sales +1.6%. We are projecting gross margin down ~160bps, to 41.1%, and we expect SG&A to grow +2% in dollars, to 34.9%. As a result, we expect operating margin to contract ~210bps, to 6.1%. 4 | Equity Research NIKE, Inc.

This is closer to a ""recovery"" multiple on trough earnings which we believe accurately reflects current headwinds and tariff impacts We believe that ongoing opportunities for rev growth, margin expansion, and FCF generation justify our target multiples, though we do see many near-term puts and takes around revenue/margin. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for NKE Downside risks: (1) new innovation (along w/ franchise reset) does not drive topline; (2) global demand remains tepid; and (3) the transition back to wholesale from DTC causes more material headwinds to profits in the NT. Upside risks include a positive turn in Chinese consumption trends and better than expected performance in US clearance activity on both sales and margins.

WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.

Gross margins were,3,1,4,"down 320bps in the quarter which was ahead of guidance of down 350-425bps. Given updated tariff rates since the Q4 call, they now expect a 120bps net impact for FY26 (up from 75bps previously). This includes a 175bps headwind in Q2, contributing to an overall gross margin decline of 300-375bps expected for Q2. Other headwinds include channel mix and market reset actions in China and for Converse. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 5 OF THIS REPORT. October 1, 2025 At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS This one-time darling of investors has clearly been off its game in recent years, but we believe that the worst may nearly be over. The biggest catalyst of change is the recent CEO transition, from John Donohoe (who in hindsight was ill-suited for the role) to well-respected Nike veteran Elliott Hill. We also believe that management is clear-headed about the mistakes they've made, and is working aggressively to correct them. BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS Given the pain the company took in We assume that sales are -LSD constant- In a bear case, NKE's revenue recovery FY25, the declines in Jordan/Dunk/Air FX in FY26, with positive FX impacts could take longer than expected, with Force 1 could moderate more quickly resulting in reported sales up slightly.

As a result, sales In FY27, we expect solid growth in some fundamental improvement in FY27, could actually be flat-to-up in constant-FX sales (up MSD), margins (up 150-200bps), earnings power could be below $2.00.

Source: CRSHK estimates October 9, 2025 Earnings Review Valuation Maintain HOLD and raise target price to US$75.30. Following our earnings forecast revisions, we raise our target price to US$75.30 from US$72.90, based on 31.5x FY27E P/E (unchanged), benchmarking Nike’s 12-month forward average P/E over the past three years, considering both Nike’s long-term market-leading position and its likely profitability recovery in FY27E from the bottom in FY26E. We are positive on Nike’s running and wholesale performance which showed early positive signs of its “Win Now” actions, although its near-term profit might be still challenging amid the US tariff. We will keep an eye on its new launch of NikeSKIMS and see if any strong-selling products would hit the market to drive its business back to a modest growth trajectory. Maintain HOLD.

Any faster-than-expected improvement in consumer spending in both regions could have a positive impact on Nike’s top line, exceeding our forecasts. • Faster gross margin expansion driven by better pricing and channel mix: If Nike’s inventory adjustment progresses faster than we expect, and its product mix improves on a greater contribution from new products, Nike’s gross margin would likely expand, helped by the contribution from full-priced products and the better channel mix. • Easing competition landscape: If Nike introduces new and innovative footwear and apparel products to increase its competitiveness, the recovery of sell-through could lead to market share gains that would boost its top line. • Lower-than-expected demand creation expenses: While management targets to bring its demand creation expense ratio back to the 10% range, we note any better-than-expected sales would likely lead to operating efficiency and result in earnings upside. Downside risks to our target price include: • A consumer spending slowdown globally: A pullback in consumer spending amid declining consumer confidence could have a negative impact on the consumer discretionary sector, and Nike’s sales could come under pressure. • Gross margin risks from larger-than-expected discounts: Nike may need to offer higher discounts to clear inventory if its sell-through rate is weaker than expected, which could further squeeze its gross margin. • Intense competition: Increasing competition from new entrants and existing players would bring more pressure on Nike’s sales and may lead to further market share loss in various verticals, which could hurt its revenue. • Global sourcing and supply chain disruptions: The potential tariff threat from the US may cause supply chain disruptions to Nike and bring gross margin pressure.

Notably, management teams struck a more optimistic tone on China particularly relative to last year’s conference - pointing to potential “stabilization” in the region and early signs of the region moving past its bottom. Leading across brands, TPR reported over 20% growth within China at the Coach brand in C3Q, with management citing an opportunity to scale Coach stores in the region notably densely populated regions (i.e. Wuhan) to tap into point-of-market-entry customer acquisition. By category, Sporting Good laterals pointed to the Outdoor category as the fastest growth Sportswear segment in the China market, in addition to high-end positioned brands (> mass brands), with AS’s Salomon and Arc’teryx brands both positioned at the high-end/outdoor market & taking share within a fragmented category by our work. Interestingly, NKE cited the middle-income cohort in China beginning to show signs of stabilization, which was further echoed by CPRI noting signs of a slight rebound seen recently in the China market. At the high-end, LUXE also noted China as likely having reached a bottom “more optimistic today for luxury in the region relative to a year ago”, w/ our European analyst counterpart C. Battistini similarly citing a “definitely more constructive” tone on China versus last year following some improvement seen in 3Q across European Luxury. (4) Pivot to Top-of-Funnel Marketing Supports Long-Term Brand-Building: Within marketing, management teams at this year’s conference broadly spoke to a shift within advertising budgets to more top-of-funnel campaigns (focused on brand-building storytelling, large-scale global events), in addition to middle-funnel strategies to leverage global influencers, while reducing exposure to performance marketing/lower-funnel activities (i.e. “click bait” ads typically tied to a promotional offer). Specifically, RL cited a CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R.

TPR similarly cited a notable shift from performance marketing to upper- funnel marketing (with aspirations to drive upper-funnel marketing mix to 60% > 45% today > almost non-existent 6 years ago in 2019). Building on the success of the Beyonce collaboration this year, LEVI pointed to marketing opportunities into FY26 similarly focused on the top-of-funnel across global Sports moments (Superbowl & World Cup) and Music (leveraging the brand’s partnership with Shaboozey). Lastly, CPRI cited the Michael Kors recently launched Hotel Stories campaign to emphasize the brand’s Jet Set brand codes/ heritage as leveraging social media influencers through a middle-funnel marketing focus (vs. performance/lower-funnel marketing historically). Taking a step back, we note marketing as a % of sales has increased +250bps on average across our coverage to 8.5% of sales (> 6% pre pandemic), including most notably TPR and RL increasing marketing as a % of sales by +650bps and +300bps vs pre pandemic, respectively. (5) Balancing Distribution Strategy Across Wholesale & DTC Channels: With the majority of our Global Brands on a healthier base of channel distribution today, management teams struck a more balanced tone across DTC relative to Wholesale channels (vs. “rip the bandaid off” distribution haircuts to Wholesale exiting the pandemic). To that point, while management teams broadly expect DTC growth to continue to outpace wholesale growth multi-year, management teams positively spoke to strategic wholesale accounts as playing an important role driving additional new customer acquisition across different customer cohorts notably citing younger consumer preference for in-person physical shopping. As an example, RL cited Macys.com and Luxury wholesale accounts as equally important wholesale partners to support the brand’s growth in the channel, and NKE recently expanded distribution new accounts across both the top of the market (i.e. Aritzia) and mass channels (i.e. AMZN) with an intent to flow more product consistently over the coming quarters. Further, BIRK cited a channel agnostic approach to growth, with “new to brand” customer acquisition notably seen across family footwear partner such as Journeys and DSW in the US.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

Company Specific Management Access Takeaways & Model Implications Ralph Lauren (RL) – Remain Overweight w/ $430 Price Target We hosted President & CEO Patrice Louvet, CFO Justin Picicci, Chief Marketing Officer Iris Langlois-Meurinne, and SVP, Head of Investor Relations Corinna Van der Ghinst at our Global Luxury & Brands Conference in Paris and thought value-add to share our key takeaways. (1) Full-Funnel Marketing = Global New Customer Acquisition & Market Share “Amplifier”: The key message from CEO Louvet was significant growth ahead for the Ralph Lauren brand at less than 2% market share today within a fragmented $400B premium/ luxury total addressable market, with RL’s Next Great Chapter Investor Day plan calling for a +mid-single-digit revenue CAGR c/c through FY28 and diversified growth across regions (Asia forecasted +HSD% through FY28, Europe +MSD, N. America +LSD%), categories, and channels. Representing a near-term “unlock” driving the brand’s accelerated pace of revenue growth(+12% constant-currency revenue growth TTM > +6.1% c/c growth in FY23/24), management cited a pivot over the last 1.5 years from below-the-line/ performance marketing to full-funnel marketing with the output being new customer acquisition (1.5M new customers/quarter) disproportionately focused on high-income individuals, Gen-Z, and Women. In addition, management cited new customer acquisition seen across channels, including wholesale (spanning across macys.com and a “very strong response” across Luxury accounts) and DTC (~two-thirds of sales), citing each part of the brand’s ecosystem designed to trade customers “in” and trade customers “across” segments. Further, management cited Unit Growth paired with AUR growth has been seen across China/Digital in addition to high-potential categories (Women, Handbags, Outerwear).",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com across categories (including serving as the largest luxury fashion brand across major league sports), (iii) leveraging social media & a data-driven approach (i.e. “Ralph Lauren Holiday” viral tagline), and (iv) driving increased baskets through outfitting/styling suggestions (i.e. Ask Ralph AI feature). (2) 3 Key Near-Term Areas of Embedded North America Consumer “Caution” = FY26 Upside Drivers: Near-term, management’s consolidated revenue outlook over the balance of the year assumes +MSD% c/c growth in 3Q & an implied -MSD% decline in 4Q at the midpoint (= Flat constant-currency 2H26 growth, or a ~1,300bps deceleration vs. 1H26 actual results). Specifically, mgmt noted 3 areas of 2H moderation built into the outlook: • (i) North America DTC – management embedded revenues to moderate tied to unit degradation among outlet/value channel customers tied to lateral pricing actions with zero signs of softening global demand for the RL brand seen to date. • (ii) North America Wholesale – mgmt embedded revenues to moderate on partner cancellations, moderating sell-out trends, and softening replenishment/re-orders. Importantly, management cited “encouraging broad-based momentum” with no indications of demand deterioration through early holiday across outlets, wholesale partners, or the core consumer, including no signs of elasticity to date from consumers. • (iii) 2H26 gross margin – mgmt’s outlook embeds a promotional backdrop in North America less favorable relative to 1H26 (w/ 1H26 gross margins outperforming mgmt expectations by +50bps largely on above-plan full-price selling mix evidenced by 1H26 AUR growth +13% > +HSD% guidance), which is not embedded to continue into 2H26 given the macroeconomic backdrop. On upside, management confirmed “extra dry powder” on core product (inventory ~70% core) to support better-than-anticipated potential demand across DTC/ wholesale channels, with sustained +double-digit N/A revenue growth (vs. 3Q’s N/A “up slightly” guidance) driving an incremental +500bps to consolidated topline growth by our math (= +10% c/c 3Q consolidated revenue growth > +MSD% c/c consolidated guidance & Street +6.4% c/c). (3) No “Ceiling” to Profitability Over Time w/ Durable Margin Drivers in Place Today: Multi-year, management’s 9/16 Investor Day outlook calls for +100-150bps c/c operating margin expansion from FY25-28 based on a “balanced” contribution from gross margin relative to SG&A leverage, with management recently raising on 11/6 FY26’s current outlook to +60-80bps of operating margin expansion c/c (> +40-60bps expansion c/c prior 8/7 guidance). To that point, management cited top/bottom-line outperformance within the 3-yr plan is expected to flow-through as upside vs. management’s FY28 targets (after considering how much to reinvest behind those gains) - pointing to FY28 operating margins of 15.2-15.7% flowing through FY26’s current upside (> 15.0-15.5% 9/16 target) & CEO Louvet citing “no ceiling” to operating margins for the company. Importantly, management cited a relatively even contribution from four “evergreen” durable drivers of: (i) geographic & channel mix w/ Asia the highest AUR region outpacing N/A & DTC outpacing wholesale, (ii) product mix elevation as management elevates materials/fabrics within the “core” and drives high-potential category growth (i.e. Women’s, handbags, and outerwear), (iii) promotion optimization through targeted/personalized offers on improved data capabilities & with segmentation only in early innings today, and (iv) like- for-like pricing primarily used to offset “structural” cost inflation. On expenses, having now scaled infrastructure investments across stores, technology, and marketing, CFO Picicci reiterated expectations to now leverage SG&A expenses annually at the forecasted +mid- single-digit revenue CAGR, while at the same time increasing marketing (targeted 7.5-8.5% by FY28) and reinvesting on store expansion.

Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com • Breaking Down 2H Gross Margin Puts/Takes: On gross margin, mgmt’s 3Q gross margin outlook calls for +50-70bps expansion c/c including structural mix drivers (channel, geographic, product and full-price selling mix) and strategic pricing actions, more than offsetting the “progressive” tariff headwind in 3Q (w/ tariff headwinds in magnitude in 3Q > 2Q). Management’s FY26 gross margin outlook of +10-30bps c/c expansion Y/Y implies 4Q gross margin compression of ~200bps c/c at the high-end, with mgmt confirming “nuances” to 4Q gross margin led by (i) unusually high gross profit margin comparisons Y/Y, and (ii) “peak” tariff headwind (in-line w/ mgmt’s plan) on the smallest quarter on revenue seasonality. To that point, management characterized 4Q’s gross margin to reflect a “transition quarter” with the magnitude of mitigation actions expected to meaningfully increase moving through FY27 as mitigation efforts from sourcing, normal course pricing and a pullback on discounting take greater effect more broadly (including 2H27 GPM opportunity > 1H27). Tapestry, Inc. (TPR) – Remain Overweight, Raising Price Target to $148 We hosted Coach CEO & Brand President Todd Kahn, Global Head of Investor Relations Christina Colone, and Director of Investor Relations Maddison Miller at our Global Luxury & Brands Conference in Paris and thought value-add to share our key takeaways. (1) Building to a $10B Coach Brand Multi-Year w/ Point of Market New Customer Acquisition: Coach CEO Kahn characterized the 9/10 Investor Day target of +mid-single- digit revenue growth at Coach as a “floor” for the brand, having already started off strong start (w/+LDD% growth anticipated in FY26 & +21% c/c growth YTD). To that end, Coach CEO Kahn noted the long-term aspiration is build to a $10B Coach brand (vs. ~$5.9B TTM today & relative to mgmt’s implied FY28 target of $6.5B) on consistent Mid-30s operating margins (= FY28 target & relative to TTM 33.8%) by acquiringnew customers at the point of market entry (= 18-27 year old demographic) and retaining these customers over their lifetime. To that end, Coach CEO Kahn noted roughly 25M women in Coach’s existing markets (who can afford their handbags) every year will turn 18 years old looking to make their first handbag purchase over $100 (including ~5M consumers alone in China), with Point of Market Entry customers to represent ~85% of new customer acquisition through FY28. In addition, management sees ~75% of new customers to be acquired Internationally (with TPR 6% penetrated of Gen Z in North America relative to less than 1% in all other geographies), noting a significant whitespace for growth in China (notably in densely populated university areas such as Wuhan to capture Gen-Z customers) and Europe (w/ initial traction of Coach in the UK to-date, relative to France as the next large opportunity and distribution opportunities across Digital/Wholesale). Positively, management also noted Gen Z 1-year retention rates continue to outperform the balance of cohorts by ~150bps (= increased purchase frequency), Gen-Z customers are beginning to influence older age generations, and Gen-Z customers are transacting with the brand at higher AURs (= +15% Handbag AUR growth the last twelve months). Setting the foundation for new customer acquisition, management pointed to the brand’s investments across (i) product with a ~30% reduction on the tail of inventory ~5 years ago to focus on clear distinct product families such as Tabby/Empire/Brooklyn, (ii) marketing w/ the budget more than tripled from ~3% of sales spent in FY19 to 11% of sales today and a notable shift from performance marketing to Upper-Funnel marketing (~45% of mix today w/ a goal to drive this higher to 60% relative to almost non-existent ~6 years ago), and (iii) data/digital infrastructure w/ the brand ~85%+ DTC enabling firsthand insights on customer data, in addition to management implementing ethnographic studies to ensure brand messaging continues to cut-through directly to the target Point of Market Entry customer demographic. • Put together, management sees Coach’s revenue growth go-forward as driven by the combination of “core” Handbag category on unit growth (new customer acquisition CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com at Point of Market Entry) and AUR growth (bolstered by Gen-Z acquisition, product innovation, and marketing), in addition to “non-core” category opportunities such as Men’s (now beginning to inflect as a positive contributor to comps) and Footwear (focused on sneakers/Gen-Z relevant categories & importantly a basket-builder driving operating margin accretion). (2) Near-Term Consistent Coach Momentum Across Regions w/ Units Inflection: Building on 1Q’s brand momentum (+21% Y/Y c/c) – management confirmed October/2Q to-date revenue growth at the Coach brand tracking consistently driven by AUR/unit growth momentum, notably in the Handbags category w/ leading families Tabby, New York, Teri, alongside strength in the Footwear category (led by the Soho sneaker). Illustrating global brand heat – the Lyst index ranked Coach’s Brooklyn Bag and Cherry Charms within its Top 10 hottest items global list in C2Q, with the Empire Bag ranking within the Top 10 for C3Q, and Coach overall ranking as #5 across brands. • Drilling down on 2QTD momentum at the Coach brand (in-line w/ 21% total Coach brand growth in 1Q) – our work points to “consistency” in momentum across all regions – including North America sustaining into 2QTD +Mid-20s revenue growth (w/ 1Q N. America +26%) – pointing to “stack-breaking” upside in 2Q & 2H based on current momentum and relative to management’s outlook embedding total Coach revenues low-double-digit Y/Y in 2Q & FY26. Driving the 2-yr stacked growth upside into 2QTD, our work points to sustained Handbag unit growth momentum (“at least” mid-single-digit growth seen in 1Q) and Handbag AUR growth (+Mid-Teens growth in 1Q), despite cycling up against more challenging Y/Y comparisons in the month of October. (3) Mid-30s Operating Margin Profile Multi-Year w/ Self-Funded Marketing Reinvestments: Following structural changes at Coach under CEO Kahn’s leadership since taking the helm in March ’20 (SKU rationalization, reduction in promotional activity across Outlets/DTC, and amplified marketing/brand messaging), Coach has realized over +800bps of gross margin expansion to 78.2% TTM and nearly +700bps of operating margin expansion to 33.8% TTM, despite increasing Marketing as a % of sales by +800bps over the same period (11% of sales today > 3% pre-pandemic). Said differently, Coach CEO Kahn cited tight expense discipline against non-marketing SG&A expenses in order to fuel brand-building reinvestments across marketing/DTC store expansion and drive top-line growth (+5.4% CAGR relative to 2019) and gross profit dollar growth expansion. Looking ahead, management cited expectations to expand to Mid-30s operating margins in FY28 supported by: (i) AUR improvement (product innovation, higher mix of full-price selling, and newly acquired customer cohorts transacting at higher AURs – noting “inflation plus 1%” as a floor for pricing and significant room within the $200-500 sweet spot range to acquire new Gen-Z customers), (ii) favorable geographic mix (China), (iii) tariff cost mitigation, and (iv) SG&A leverage, even net of marketing reinvestments. Importantly, TPR has a more variable expense profile today relative to pre-pandemic w/ key investments outlined (digital, marketing) variable in nature and enabling cost flexibility if needed.

A key point - management noted the global denim category is forecasted to grow globally +mid-single-digits (+4% by Euromonitor), with LEVI historically growing at a rate ~2x the denim category including (i) pre-pandemic (+4% LEVI growth FY14-19 > category -0.9%) & (ii) over the trailing twelve months w/ LEVI organic growth +8.1% > category +4%). To that point, management cited an opportunity to continue to drive revenue growth outpacing the category led by above-category growth across Women’s, Tops, and Non- Denim (= underpenetrated categories), International, and the DTC channel relative to in-line category growth within Men’s and more modest growth assumptions within the Wholesale channel, supporting the build to mid-single-digit(+) revenue growth. Further, management cited the “core” Denim category continues to see strong momentum within LEVI fueled by new silhouettes (denim skirts, dresses, jumpsuits), fabric innovation (i.e. lightweight fabrications), and expanded product offerings across price points (i.e. Blue Tab launch), which are collectively increasing the total addressable market for the LEVI brand (including the premium category alone adding an incremental +$10B TAM expansion alone). • Further into FY26, management cited expectations for a roughly consistent marketing budget at 7% of sales, which will be focused on driving continued cultural momentum (following the Beyonce collaboration this past year) through top-of-funnel marketing campaigns across global Sports moments (citing a new brand campaign to launch around the Superbowl at LEVI Stadium and World Cup games hosted at Levi’s stadium) & Music (i.e. Shaboozey partnership tapping into the Quiet Western opportunity), in addition to more influencers globally YOY.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

To that point, management cited a globally “resilient” consumer, including within (i) the US where LEVI averages a household income demographic of $100-200K (noting DTC on the higher-end vs. wholesale on the lower side) and mgmt noted consumers continue to respond to newness/product innovation, against tightly managed trade inventories in the industry (= full-price selling upside lever), and (ii) Europe where management previously cited a +double-digit exit rate in August out of 3Q (vs. total 3Q +3%), with strong momentum continuing into 4Q by our work supporting upside relative to mgmt’s implied low-to-mid-single-digit 4Q Europe revenue guidance. Additionally, management said the denim category overall in the US improved progressively throughout the year, from ~Flattish growth in 1Q, to +2% growth in 2Q, and +4% growth in 3Q, supported by broader casualization tailwinds and diversified drivers across silhouettes (i.e. Looser Fit, Slim Fit, and Western).",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

Specifically into FY26 – and outside of structural mix drivers – management noted tariffs will represent a wrap-around headwind into 1H26 (w/ FY25 expected to realize a ~20bps net tariff headwind after initial impact in 3Q/4Q). That said, CFO Singh cited multiple offsetting drivers to tariffs including: (i) favorability on cotton input costs, (ii) continued SKU rationalization, and (iii) increased SKU commonality (>30% in FY26 vs. 30% in FY25 vs. HSD% in FY24) support greater volume leverage & buying efficiencies – supporting in our view an at least “algorithm” year of gross margin expansion (= JPMe +35bps expansion Y/Y > Street +15bps Y/Y).

In addition to “core” SG&A leverage at +mid-single-digit revenue growth, management cited an opportunity to drive ~100-200bps of improvement against Distribution expenses (vs. ~7% of sales today) following the company’s recent remapping of its distribution centers which has resulted in 1x expenses associated with running parallel DCs to ensure a smooth transition. To that point, management previously cited the cost of running parallel DCs to begin to abate into early 2026 (2Q26 onwards by our work), in addition to the overall distribution center remapping to drive to long-term savings from improved cost/unit productivity. Birkenstock (BIRK) – Remain Overweight w/ $66 Price Target We hosted CEO Oliver Reichert , CFO Ivica Krolo, and Director of Investor Relations Megan Kulick for group meetings at our Global Luxury & Brands Conference in Paris and thought value-add to share our key takeaways. (1) Brand Heat Remains Strong Across All Regions: Looking across regions, CEO Reichert cited strong brand heat for Birkenstock seen across every single geography today. (i) In the US - management cited zero “hiccups” as a result of +low-single-digit average price increase taken in early July ahead of tariffs, with zero signs of consumer pushback to pricing nor partner cancellations, noting trading up within the brand taking place to more premium/higher ASP products and 95%+ full-price realization in the region across channels. (ii) Europe -management clarified demand has not softened in the region with growth seen across countries, including in Germany. (iii) Asia - management continues to anticipate top-line growth double the rest of world, self-restricting the pace of China expansion today. Driving the brand momentum, management cited new customer acquisition notably at the younger customer demographic (16-25 years old), or “new to brand” consumers supporting growth of the core silhouettes. Put together, management cited the brand is coming from a position of strength out of Back to School and into Holiday – with 4Q25 (Sept-end) pre-announced on 9/25 to see reported top-line growth of at least +18% constant-currency growth. For FY26: we expect management to outline an initial FY26 financial guide at mid-teens “plus” constant-currency revenue growth (= Street +15.5% c/c) and 20%+ earnings growth – in-line with the company’s go-forward “base-line” top & bottom-line annual growth algorithm in our view. To this point, we model FY26 EPS of €2.05 representing +21% EPS growth with potential upside to our embedded +16.3% c/c revenue growth – setting up a beat/raise opportunity throughout the year. • Near-term, management cited today’s sole concern into Holiday is the ability to deliver enough product (particularly given B2B demand > capacity by at least 20% across current partners today). To this point – our recent fieldwork points to potential upside to our +16.9% 1Q26 c/c revenue growth translating to a 36% 2-year stack, which if held constant through the year would equate to a 18%+ FY26 c/c revenue growth (exceeding our model at +16.3% and +15.5% Consensus).",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com specifically, management cited opportunities for EMEA across “best” doors, ski resorts, golf pro-shops, with outdoor sports relatively small today in EMEA (only having “just started” distribution across FL, JD, Snipes), while in the US, management noted an opportunity to expand to incremental doors within existing partners (i.e., DKS/FL). Specifically, managementclarified that there is not a specific timeline to expand to the additional 5K B2B doors, but rather a point to illustrate the brand as underpenetrated in quality partners to date. In addition, management cited expanded shelf space within existing B2B partners through expanded breadth (new use-occasions/category expansion) & increased depth of existing silhouettes. Further, management confirmed no cannibalization against the B2B business to date upon the opening of new retail doors (w/ DTC stores running high-single-digit comps on average with zero change to the target of 150 DTC stores by FY27), representing a key unlock of the dual-channel growth with full-price sell-through of 95%+ (vs global brands ~70% on average) driving channel agnostic growth. • Wholesale EBITDA Margins Remain 400-500bps > Direct to Consumer: mgmt noted wholesale EBITDA margins stand roughly ~400-500bps higher than DTC today (attributed to higher variable costs on DTC e-commerce shipments), while wholesale margins compared to brick/mortar stores within DTC are “roughly similar”, supporting management’s continued channel agnostic approach to growth.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

Breaking down the drivers, we model adj. EBITDA margin expansion of +40bps annually in FY26-28, equating to 32.9% adj. EBITDA margins by FY28 driven by a combination of gross margin expansion (production efficiencies and annual pricing) and slight SG&A leverage (led by G&A expense leverage despite accelerated store openings) translating to a +21% 3-year EPS growth CAGR by our model (against our revenue +16.0% growth FY26-28). Importantly, our model prudently reflects no incremental share repurchases. To that end, we note net leverage “on track” to be 1.5x by FY25-end (vs. 1.7x as of 3Q25), with our forecasted ~€425M of FCF over the next 3 years remaining post Capex supporting potential debt repayments and/or share repurchases (= +3-4% annual EPS growth accretion should FCF be used entirely for share repurchases). Said differently, at high-teens revenue growth c/c the next 3 years (or +16% reported), our model math points to the potential for a +25% EPS growth algorithm inclusive of +3-4% EPS growth accretion from share repurchases & +21% operational EPS growth. Capri Holdings (CPRI) – Remain Overweight w/ $30 Price Target We hosted CEO John Idol and VP of Investor Relations Jennifer Davis for group meetings at our Global Luxury & Brands Conference in Paris and thought value-add to share our key takeaways. (1) Breaking Down the Full-Price Comp Inflection at Kors: Drilling down within 2Q’s inflection to positive full-price retail comps at the Michael Kors brand (which occurred ahead of mgmt’s initial expectations to occur later this year), our work points to full-price retail comps reaching+mid-single-digit growth in 2Q (> 1Q full-price comps down slightly). Specifically, the 500bps(+) sequential acceleration was supported by (i) strength across core leather goods led by Icons (Laila, Hamilton, and Nolita) & Trend-driven product following mgmt’s pricing architecture reset, with management in “chase mode” on inventory, in addition above-plan results across Ready-to-Wear, (ii) the return of lapsed customersback into the brand w/ mgmt also targeting the Millennial customer CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com demographic (core 26-32 years old), and (iii) improved marketing through the Hotel Stories campaign to emphasize the brands Jet Set brand codes/heritage and leveraging social media influencers through middle-funnel marketing focus (vs. performance/lower-funnel marketing historically). Looking ahead, management’s 11/4 outlook calls for Kors’ retail sales trends to continue to improve in 2H26 (vs. 1H26 retail sales -MSD%), positioning the channel for a return to growth in FY27, with our work pointing to embedded improvement driven by full-price retail comps through year-end supported by current product/marketing momentum. Worth noting on full-price stores – CEO Idol noted retail store closures will largely be complete by the end of FY26 (w/ closures driving a -LSD% headwind to retail sales year-to-date), with plans to also renovate ~50% of the store fleet & key department store locations over the next 3 years as part of an ongoing investment to elevate the brand & improve sales productivity (w/ the recently renovated Rockefeller Center location in NYC already seeing significant increase in traffic/sales versus last year). (2) Quality of Sales Reset Actions Near-Term at Outlet and Wholesale: Outside of full- price retail comps turning positive in 2Q, management cited “single digit” declines at POS within Wholesale at Kors, in addition to our estimates pointing to a negative mid-to-high- single-digit same-store-sales decline within Outlet stores. On Outlets, management noted over 60% of the current decline experienced in the channel is from deliberate actions to drive higher Quality of Sales (i.e. shutting down the Daigou business), equating to an underlying low-single-digit Outlet comp decline by our estimates. On the improvement path from here, our model reflects consistent negative mid-to-high-single-digit comp declines in Outlets in 2H (= 2Q), with potential upside opportunity in 4Q26 (> 3Q) in Outlets by our work supported by the introduction of more trend-right product at greater scale and the full lap of daigou-related Outlet headwinds in 2Q/3Q27 (= positive Outlet comp inflection opportunity). On Wholesale, management noted door count reductions will be lapped in 1Q27, noting additional reductions within the Off-Price segment planned to occur in FY27, equating to an anticipated Wholesale decline into FY27 (albeit less negative than FY26) consistent w/ mgmt’s 11/4 commentary “I think for next year, I wouldn’t say there’s going to be an improvement in the wholesale revenues, because again, we’re going to do some cleanup work around off-price”. • Putting the pieces together, our model reflects “underlying” (excluding the $20M wholesale shipment timing out of 2Q into 3Q) 2H26 Kors revenues -3.7%, representing a +80bps sequential improvement (vs. 2Q -4.5% underlying) supported by full-price comp sequential improvement, unchanged Outlet comps (vs. 2Q), and “single-digit” Wholesale POS declines by our bottom-up build. Into FY27, our model reflects +1.8% Kors revenue growth Y/Y (vs. Street +1.7%), inclusive of +3% retail sales growth (+MSD% Full-Price comps vs. Flattish Outlets) and a -2% decline within Wholesale. (3) Jimmy Choo Full Price Comp Inflection w/ Handbag Oppty Multi-Year: Within Jimmy Choo’s 2Q negative low-single-digit retail sales decline (> 1Q -MSD%), management clarified full-price comps turned positive, with all regions showing sequential improvement supported by management’s refocused strategy across core footwear in addition to the Handbag category citing phenomenal” sell-through on bags at the opening price point of $1,000-$1,500 with the an “open lane” opportunity relative to traditional European Luxury peers. To that end, management cited a significant revenue & profit opportunity associated with increasing the mix of the handbag category to 30-40% of the store business (vs. ~23% today), with long-term aspirations to drive Jimmy Choo’s operating margins above the MSD% FY28 target to HSD%+ over time. Worth noting on distribution, management cited the brand is only expected to see ~5-10 store closures next year and to move past the sizeable headwind from Net-a-Porter’s restructuring this year.

Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com (4) Gross Margin Inflection Underlying Combined w/ Tight SG&A Management: While Quality of Sales actions taken across Outlets and Wholesale rationalization are near- term constraining revenue growth, management cited a significant margin expansion opportunity following these actions, noting FY26 gross margins “underlying” excluding tariffs would have expanded +50bps on improved full-price selling mix/reduced discounting. In addition, management sees an opportunity to mitigate the “majority” of tariff headwinds into FY27 through the combination of vendor negotiations and selective price adjustment actions, which by our math points to a potential +100bps opportunity to gross margins from tariffs alone, in addition to ongoing full-price selling improvements. Further on expenses, management sees SG&A $’s “roughly flattish” over the next two years, translating to ~110bps of SG&A leverage on average over FY27/28 on our model. (5) Versace Transaction On Track w/ Capital Allocation Oppty: Worth noting, CPRI expects the Versace transaction to close this quarter, with mgmt reiterating intent to use proceeds to drive a reduction in debt on the balance sheet, w/ the Versace transaction driving $1.375B of proceeds relative to current debt levels of $1.76B. Looking forward, management expects meaningful interest expense savings into FY27 (following debt paydown when the Versace transaction closes), while interest income favorability continues on net investment hedges, translating to incremental bottom-line upside Y/Y into FY27 (vs. FY26’s $90M net interest income guidance). VF Corp (VFC) – Remain Neutral w/ $14 Price Target We hosted CEO Bracken Darrell, CFO Paul Vogel, and VP of Investor Relations Allegra Perry for group meetings at our Global Luxury & Brands Conference in Paris and thought value-add to share our key takeaways. (1) Negative HSD% Underlying Revenue Decline at Vans w/ Traffic The Largest Constraint: Drilling down within 2Q’s -11% constant-currency decline at Vans, management quantified ~20% of the decline associated with value-channel reset actions, equating to a negative high-single-digit “underlying” revenue decline at Vans (commensurate with the trailing 3 quarters -HSD% underlying on our estimates). On initial greenshoots “under the hood” at the brand – management cited growth in (i) non-icons during 2Q driven by the Super Lowpro, the Skate Loafer, and the Crosspath XC, (ii) initial pockets of the Icons showing growth in the quarter, including the Authentic franchise supported by the Valentino collab and Old Skool Women’s. Importantly, CEO Darrell cited his “conviction” in the brand’s return to growth remains predicated on more newness/product launches ahead (albeit with no clear timeline outlined for the brand’s revenue growth inflection noting growth across the Icons is required). Further, following management’s deliberate actions to close ~20% of the DTC store fleet and reduce Value Channel wholesale exposure to roughly one-third of WS sales (vs. ~50% prior), CEO Darrell clarified Vans distribution as now “right sized, but not right performing” with traffic remaining the biggest constraint to brick/mortar performance (& a circular reference back to product/newness). Outside of product, management noted the shift to social-first marketing and the brand’s partnership with SZA (collection to come down the line) have supported Vans re-establishment within its core Skate community, with the largest customer recapture opportunity across Youth and Women. On initial marketing traction, mgmt cited improved digital traffic throughout BTS coincided with the “Warped Tour” campaigns on the push to younger generations, with opportunity ahead on “Meet the Vans” Holiday campaign. • Worth noting on margins, Active segment (namely Vans) operating margins declined 270bps Y/Y in 2Q, inclusive of gross margins down ~200bps Y/Y, with mgmt clarifying the overall headline promotional rates remain lower, though more sales volume was concentrated during the “peak” Back to School period on promotion resulting in CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com YOY gross margin contraction. (2) Top Focus On The North Face Brand: On The North Face, management outlined mixed growth opportunities across regions, citing significant opportunity for product elevation within the Americas (> Europe > APAC) relative to “stabilizing” trends seen within APAC, particularly China, following long periods of growth in the region, while reiterating the long- term opportunity seen to double the size of The North Face brand (vs. $3.7B revenues as of FY25). More specifically, CEO Darrell noted he is “most excited” by the “elevation” opportunity at TNF to sell into luxury while still catering to the mass market – with the US the largest opportunity for more elevated product – and initial more premium product launched to date across (i) Red Box launched in late July, (ii) the Summit series head-to-toe offering (which represents <1% of the business), and (iii) another line “even higher” coming soon. In addition to a more premium apparel/footwear offering, management also cited an opportunity to triple the size of the existing Footwear category to offer an improved head-to- toe offering. Conversely in APAC, TNF realized +7% c/c growth in 2Q in the region relative to +16% TTM (with total VFC APAC revenues declining -2% c/c in the quarter), with management citing the brand having enjoyed a multi-year period of “grow, grow, grow, and then flat line” in the region noting the “plateauing in APAC” at the North Face brand within the range of initial expectations as it relates to the FY28 Investor Day plan. (3) 10% Operating Margin Target “On Track” Despite Revenues To Date < FY24 Base. Management noted “we still feel confident about the 10% operating margin” target from the 10/30/24 Investor Day (vs. TTM 6.5% operating margins), with more significant progress to-date made against gross margins (TTM 54.0% gross margin vs. ~55% FY28 target) relative to SG&A as % of sales 47.5% TTM (vs. ~45% FY28 target). To that end, management noted the 55% gross margin target initially planned was thought of as the “minimum”, with margins seen currently “not that far” from the 55% target, with a “clear path” despite tariffs. On SG&A, management noted tight SG&A expense management near-term, with some back-end weighted expense savings initiatives in the plan to help bridge to the ~45% FY28 target. In addition, management acknowledged “something’s got to grow” to result in a Flat revenue bridge vs. FY24 as trailing twelve months revenues stand ~4% below the FY24 ex-Supreme revenue base of $9.92B. Put together, our work points to the ~10% operating margin target potentially achieved with gross margin outperformance (vs. mgmt’s 55% target), offsetting an SG&A rate potentially above the ~45% target should revenues not reaccelerate over the next 2.5 years to bridge to ~Flat vs. FY24 revenue base (currently tracking -4% to date). Nike, Inc. (NKE) – Remain Overweight w/ $86 Price Target - Recent Fieldwork & Management Access Takes Following our recent global fieldwork, management/industry access, and 10-Q analysis - we thought value-add to share our key takeaways and model implications. Our updated financial model with detailed quarterly historical builds is available upon request. Key Model Implications – Our Model Versus Consensus: (1) 2Q EPS – we model 2Q EPS of $0.36 (in-line w Street) based on (i) reported revenues -0.3% Y/Y (vs. mgmt’s negative low-single-digit revenue outlook) modeling N/A revenues above Consensus, (ii) gross margins down -350bps Y/Y (vs. mgmt’s -300bps to -375bps Y/Y guidance), and (iii) SG&A dollar growth of +6.9% Y/Y (= Street). (2) 2H26 EPS – we model 2H26 EPS of $0.56 or 25% below Consensus at $0.77 with the largest delta being gross margin (JPM modeling Flat in 2H26 vs. Street mis-modeled at +90bps in our view) with management flagging China, Converse, and Tariff headwinds CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com relative to “underlying” full-price selling tailwind in North America/EMEA. • 3Q26 EPS – we see management guiding 3Q EPS below Consensus at $0.46 on P/L components (JPM at $0.34) modeling -0.4% reported revenues (vs Street+1.5%) with N/A & EMEA momentum offset by China/Converse/APLA, gross margins down -50bps Y/Yto 41% (below Street mis-modeled +30bps Y/Y to 41.8% in our view) with China/Converse/tariff headwinds more than offsetting “underlying” full-price selling recovery, and SG&A dollar growth of +2.4% Y/Y (vs. Street +1.7%). Our full-year FY26 EPS of $1.42 remains unchanged (below Street at $1.64) based on +0.6% revenue growth, 41.0% gross margin, and 35.4% SG&A rate of sales. Remain Overweight with our $86 Dec ’26 price target based on NKE’s 1.8x pre- pandemic PEG on high-teens growth profile (& high 20’s pre-pandemic multiple on 10% Op Margin math), with a risk/reward of $68 (NKE’s pre-pandemic 27x multiple on our CY27 EPS) by $108 (= 27x on ~$4 EPS power on ~12% legacy operating margin profile). Recent Fieldwork & Key Mgmt Access Takes: • North America & EMEA “Healthy” Exiting 1Q: Importantly, management emphasized North America (42% of sales) remains the furthest ahead across a number of dimensions. First, management characterized the inventory/channel backdrop in both N. America and EMEA as “healthy” today particularly feeling good about where inventory levels exited 1Q in both regions. On actions, mgmt cited North America momentum built through elevating and transforming the marketplace by giving consumers more access to the brand and in more premium environments w/ over 1,300 running spaces reset in 1Q and the Nike brand launched on Amazon & Aritzia driving growth across multiple sport dimensions, with each of Running, Training, and Basketball +Double-Digits in 1Q and Sportswear also growing in 1Q (despite a 30% decline in classic footwear franchises). • “N/A Momentum Building” w/ Modest Wholesale Growth for Full Year: In addition to North America leading across geographies, management noted Wholesale (56% of revenues) continues to lead across channels, with “momentum” building across partners notably in North America evidenced by Spring orderbooks “Up” versus prior year & led by Sport (vs. Holiday orderbooks “up” > Fall “nearly Flat”). Specifically, management cited building strength across both (i) existing accounts with favorable adoption and sell-throughs of newness (Running first prioritized, followed by Basketball in 2Q, Football/World Cup into Spring, and Training thereafter) and (ii) new accounts across both the top of the market (Aritzia) and mass channels (AMZN) adopting Nike brand footwear & looking to flow more product consistently over the coming quarters. As a result, relative to +5% constant-currency wholesale growth in 1Q, management’s guidance calls for “wholesale revenue to return to modest growth for FY26”. • AF1s/AJ1s Inventories On Track w/ Dunks The Final Piece of “Win-Now”: Drilling down on inventories down 1.7% Y/Y exiting 1Q (vs. reported revenues +1.1%) on a consolidated basis, management noted as of the 9/30 EPS Call that AF1s are “stabilizing” & AJ1 inventory levels are “returning to health”, with heavy markdowns to return inventory levels to healthy weeks of supply no longer immediately required across the marketplace noting increased signals of AF1s/AJ1s in certain geographies (i.e. North America) returning to a “pull” marketplace following the introduction of new colorways. On the other hand, management noted the Dunk franchise continues to be managed down aggressively in all geographies as of the 9/30 EPS Call, with liquidation efforts to continue beyond 2Q (likely complete exiting 3Q in our view). To that end, management cited on the 9/30 EPS Call “we're pleased with the progress that we've made and the actions that we put into place to exit Q2 and enter the second half in a healthy CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R. Boss, CPAAC North America Equity Research JPMORGAN (1-212) 622-2630 17 November 2025 matthew.boss@jpmorgan.com position. I think that we would expect or we do expect that we should start to see some gross margin benefit in the second half from lapping these aggressive actions”. • Converse “Early Stage” Global Market Reset: Management cited Converse (~5% of revenues and gross profit) under new leadership is in early stages of resetting its marketplace and brand, which is expected to face revenue and gross margin headwinds throughout FY26. Specifically, management noted as of the 9/30 EPS Call “the Chuck Taylor is in the early stages of a global market reset”, noting inventory growth exited 1Q ~600bps > sales growth. • Finer Point on Greater China Likely On the 2Q Call: Management emphasized Greater China (~15% of revenues & gross profit) will face revenue and gross margin headwinds throughout FY26. Specifically near-term, management cited (i) Greater China continues to face store traffic declines in Nike-owned and partner doors resulting in lower in season sell-through rates, (ii) Digital remains a highly promotional marketplace with consumer shopping moments extending longer on local platforms with deeper discounts, and (iii) clearance inventory remains elevated (despite reported China inventories declining 11% in 1Q < sales -9%). As a result, we see management citing actions to reset inventory to a pull market in the region will expend through year-end and outline a strategic multi-year plan to refresh China’s 5,000+ monobrand stores around Sport over time, through improved localization, experience (storytelling), and product creation. • Tariff Headwinds Throughout FY26: Relative to 1Q’s -100bps net tariff headwind, management’s 2Q guidance contemplates a -175bps net headwind from tariffs, with 2H26 implied to see a -100bps headwind, bridging to FY26 guidance for a net tariff headwind of -120bps.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_JP_Morgan_AS_US_Retailing-_Global_Luxury_-_Brands_Conference-_Key_The.pdf

Importantly, lateral global brand peers at our Global Luxury & Brands Conference cited the Outdoor category remains the fastest growth segment in the China market, in addition to high-end positioned brands (> mass brands), with Salomon and Arc’teryx both positioned at the high-end/outdoor market & taking share within a fragmented category. Further, on 4QTD trends on the ground in China, our work points to a tale of two halves in the month of October due to weather, with 1H of October negatively impacted by warm weather (13 degrees Celsius) coinciding with the Golden Week holiday, relative to cold snap in 2H October driving favorable sell-throughs across Down Jackets/Winter Jackets, with incremental opportunity into November with weather forecasted colder Y/Y. Remain Overweight with our Dec ’26 PT of $50 based on ~18x our FY27 EBITDA supported by SOTP analysis, or ~35x our FY27 EPS (1.4x Global Sportswear peer PEG average against management’s long-term 25% EPS CAGR as outlined at Investor Day).

We view the combination of premium, market-shaping brands (including Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson, Atomic and Peak Performance), management’s business transformation (new leadership, brand-direct operating model), an accelerated DTC sales mix, and growing brand penetration in Greater China as positive. This translates into a long-term growth algorithm of low-to-mid-teens(+) top-line (balanced across channels, regions, and segments) and +mid-to-high-teens(+) EBITDA growth algorithm. Valuation We lower our Dec ’26 price target to $50 (vs. $53 prior) based on ~18x our FY27 EBITDA supported by SOTP analysis (with Arc’teryx growing 15%+ on ~21% operating margins, representing >70% of segment operating income), or ~35x our FY27 EPS (1.4x Global Sportswear peer PEG average against management’s long-term 25% EPS CAGR as outlined at Investor Day). Risks to Rating and Price Target Downside risks to our rating and price target include: • DTC expansion – Any failure to execute planned growth could render our estimates and price target too high. • International exposure – The ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in China (= 19% sales mix & key growth driver) could result in slower-than-expected growth in China, rendering our estimates too high. • Low brand awareness – Store underperformance vs. expectations may lead to additional investment in traditional marketing, resulting in greater expenses and rendering our estimates too high. • Wholesale partners – If any of the major wholesale partners reduce/discontinue purchases, it could adversely impact AS Sales growth. • Discretionary consumer spending risk – Amer’s merchandise mix is primarily discretionary goods and is hence susceptible to macroeconomic downturn, which could pressure consumers’ overall ability to spend and therefore weigh on revenue growth & margins. • ANTA Sports relationship – Anta Sports and Amer have entered into an agreement under which Anta will provide certain IT support services; if ANTA fails to perform under the agreement or plans to exit the investment, it could lead to decline/dilution in the stock price. • Debt leverage – If AS fails to execute against top/bottom-line expectations, there could be a downside risk associated with the required increased debt burden & therefore interest expense.

We view the combination of brand heritage (> 250 year history, inventors of the “footbed”), management’s “engineered distribution” strategy, a highly loyal customer base (average US customer owns 3.6 pairs today), and recently expanded production capacity supporting +mid-to-high-teens(+) revenue growth on stable adjusted EBITDA margins of ~30% (~10 points above global footwear peers). Valuation Our Dec ’26 price target of $66 is unchanged & based on ~22x our CY27 EPS of €2.58 (or $3.00 in USD), equating to a 1x PEG to our forward EPS growth of 21.8%. Risks to Rating and Price Target • International Exposure: Over 46% of the company’s revenues are generated outside the United States, with plans to grow the international business further. There are risks inherent in operating in new markets, and any failure to execute growth could render our estimates and price target too aggressive. • Commodity Prices: With the company’s exposure to leather, EVA, cork, adhesives, natural latex, jute, copper, wool felt, and brass buckles, any shift toward an unfavorable costing environment could pressure GPM, thus rendering our estimates and price target too aggressive. • Key Personnel Risk: CEO Oliver Reichert (with >14 years of tenure) has been “instrumental” in driving Birkenstock success, from combining 38 legal entities into single transparent body in 2012 to growing brand by 7x during his tenure. Any situation resulting in the end of his service could create disruption in operations and worsen the firm’s financial health. • Discretionary consumer spending risk: Birkenstock’s merchandise mix is primarily discretionary goods, which reach a variety of household income and age demographics. Therefore, Birkenstock is susceptible to macroeconomic risk such as a slowdown in consumer spending, decline in consumer confidence, and high levels of unemployment, which could pressure consumers’ overall ability to spend on discretionary merchandise and therefore weigh on revenue growth and margins.

Risks to Rating and Price Target • Increased competition in affordable luxury industry; • Increased promotional activity in the luxury industry; • Failure to successfully execute on brand turnarounds at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman; • Brand dilution from online outlet distribution; • Fashion miss: TPR is exposed to the rapid pace of change in fashion; and • Decreased consumer confidence and consumer discretionary spending.

(Overweight; Price Target: $86.00) Investment Thesis NKE is the global athletic market leader with diversification across product categories, geographies, and distribution, and we see the model at an inflection for revenue growth to re-accelerate into 2H26/FY27 following several quarters of franchise product lifecycle management & inventory liquidation headwinds. Further, we see opportunity for NKE to recapture over 500bps of operating margin erosion on improved full-price selling & reception to new product innovation and as NKE begins to leverage on SG&A expenses with an inflection to topline growth. Valuation We are lowering our Dec ’26 Price Target to $86 (vs. $100 prior) based on 34x our revised CY27 EPS of $2.53 (= NKE’s 1.8x pre-pandemic PEG on high-teens growth profile). Risks to Rating and Price Target The economic climate, particularly the employment picture, can affect consumer spending and the sportswear industry. A greater-than-expected downturn in household spending could cause sales trends to decelerate below our current assumptions rendering our estimates too high. Roughly 50% of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the United States, w/ downside risk to our price target if the USD strengthens further. With the company’s exposure to manufacturing in Southeast Asia, trade policy changes notably in Vietnam could render our estimates too high should NKE not be able to mitigate against tariff related costs.

Corporation(VFC/$14.97/N) Analyst Certification: The Research Analyst(s) denoted by an “AC” on the cover of this report certifies (or, where multiple Research Analysts are primarily responsible for this report, the Research Analyst denoted by an “AC” on the cover or within the document individually certifies, with respect to each security or issuer that the Research Analyst covers in this research) that: (1) all of the views expressed in this report accurately reflect the Research Analyst’s personal views about any and all of the subject securities or issuers; and (2) no part of any of the Research Analyst's compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by the Research Analyst(s) in this report. For all Korea-based Research Analysts listed on the front cover, if applicable, they also certify, as per KOFIA requirements, that the Research Analyst’s analysis was made in good faith and that the views reflect the Research Analyst’s own opinion, without undue influence or intervention. All authors named within this report are Research Analysts who produce independent research unless otherwise specified. In Europe, Sector Specialists (Sales and Trading) may be shown on this report as contacts but are not authors of the report or part of the Research Department. Important Disclosures Company-Specific Disclosures: Important disclosures, including price charts and credit opinion history tables (if applicable), are available for compendium reports and all J.P. Morgan–covered companies, and certain non-covered companies, by visiting https://www.jpmm.com/research/disclosures, calling 1-800-477-0406, or e-mailing research.disclosure.inquiries@jpmorgan.com with your request. Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. Some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe of the relevant duration of the region. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P.

Equity Research Key Point #1: Evidence Suggests ""Classics"" Clean Up Is Winding Down ""Classics"" Calamity (First, How Did We Get Here?) To better view current circumstances, it's important to first take a step back and understand how we got to this point. Essentially, NKE was enjoying some very ""high heat"" (customer demand) - really across almost all of its franchises - from a multitude of macro catalysts (fashion-trends, NBA popularity, Nike-athlete success, societal) over several years around the time of COVID (from slightly before COVID to slightly after ""re-opening""). However, NKE saw above average growth on three key ""Classics"" franchises - Air Jordan 1 (AJ1), Air Force 1 (AF1) and Dunk (mostly Dunk ""low""). This was driven by its decision not only to ride that wave as long as possible, but also to actively lean into it, which eventually resulted in over-saturation of those three silhouettes. Perhaps nothing captures ""Classics""-mania better than the June 2020 AJ1 ""Dior."" This ultra- exclusive collaboration (13K produced, with 5K going to Dior's best clients) saw 5M people sign-up to buy these $2,000 sneakers. Even to this day, they re-sell for ~$7,000 on StockX. Perhaps most famously, a relative of Vice President Kamala Harris wore a pair to the 2020 inauguration which captured a great deal of attention. Exhibit 1 - AJ 1 ""Dior"" - StockX Resale Exhibit 2 - AJ 1 ""Dior"" at the Biden/Harris Inauguration Source: stockx.com and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Source: x.com and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Two other key factors to consider, which added more fuel to the fire: 1) at the same time, NKE was moving from a wholesale-driven model to a direct model and 2) this period also marked the peak in the sneaker resale market (driven by the popularity of Nike, broadly, and Adidas' Yeezy, YeezyBoost and UltraBoost). This is clearly reflected in NKE resale premiums we can track on StockX (Ex 3 & 4). The demand for sneakers, combined with an influx of stimulus cash and new technologies connecting buyers and sellers provided the perfect storm that lead to this current situation. Ironically, the tipping point may have occurred on the 1Q24 NKE call, held September 28, 2023. On the call, then CEO John Donahoe remarked: ""Let me offer a few examples of how we've redefined the game over the past few years. The consumer told us they wanted lifestyle product, and we delivered, growing Air Force 1, AJ-1 and Dunk to be the three largest footwear franchises in industry history."" Approximately one month after those above remarks, total Nike resale premiums inflected negative for the first time in our data set (Nov '23).

However, this time has been very different and much more significant. We believe once the dust settles, NKE will have absorbed a total $6B headwind from market cleanup on these 3 Classics franchises. To that point, let's dig into the math behind NKE and their Classics ""peak and trough."" WFS's ""Classics"" Deep-Dive Given the magnitude of Nike's three key Classic franchises (and mixed investor visibility around the direction of revenue surrounding them), we attempted to quantify the Classics peak revenue/ penetration, recent trajectory of wind-down and outlook for FY26 and FY27. More than just simple quantification on Classics revenue (which we do come up with), however, we wanted to better understand what those measured levels imply for: 1) NKE's footwear business ex-Classics and 2) the rest of NKE's business lines (notably apparel) as we believe NKE could finally be at an inflection point, with building underlying momentum. With significant interest on this crucial topic, we rolled up our sleeves and did a deep fundamental dive based on multiple channel checks, historical reference and a handful of assumptions. 6 Key Takes Within Our Classics Footwear Analysis:",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Upgrading_to_OW_w-_-75_PT-_Visibility_Now_Improving.pdf

First - we have the setup: based on a triangulation of data points, we believe NKE exited FY23 with Classics at ~33% of total revenues and ~50% of footwear revenues. We believe FY23 was the Classics peak (negative commentary on AF1 had already emerged by 3Q24) - with a) peak footwear mix (68%) and b) footwear revenues growing +4% above total revenues (the largest spread since FY15 +3%). Second - we back into FY24 data as the base: by taking commentary from 4Q25 and 1Q26, along with feedback from channel checks, we build out quarterly assumptions for FY24 and FY25. We know that Classics were down more than 20% YoY in FY25, and we know that Classics were down > 30% in 4Q25 - resulting in a ~$1B revenue headwind. NKE also finished 4Q25 down 10% from peak Classics mix (we estimate of 39% of footwear vs our FY23 ~50% estimate). Given the data points, we believe NKE lowered Classics from 50% / 33% (footwear / total) in FY23 to 45% / 29% by FY24, and ended FY25 at 39% / 25%.

Our own findings support management's comments on AJ1 and AF1 (stabilizing) and on Dunk (still work to do). While we do not believe Dunk is being ""reduced to zero"" we reiterate management's comments that Dunk was much less meaningful to the overall portfolio pre-COVID, and should become so again, post clean-up. Thus - with evidence that AJ1 and AF1 are nearing a bottom and with a view that Dunk reductions persist for another 12+ months (3Q25 conf call: ""We intend to drive [Classics] lower in fiscal 2026, with total units planned down double-digits with the most aggressive actions on the Dunk."") we estimate that NKE will again reduce Classics sales (20%) YoY - to $9.1B in FY26 - and we believe Classics revenues level out around the ~$9B level in FY27E (which would mark a sizable decline from our estimated FY23 peak of $16B+). We also believe Classics revenues should mix back down to the < 20% range (total revenues) over the next 12-18 months - not just from the work NKE has/is doing on these franchises, but also from what we see as healthier underlying growth (we discuss this in just a bit).

For both silhouettes, we looked back 20+ years and see 2 instances, each, of peak / trough periods defined by Google search interest. Vans Old Skool Has Ups...and Downs First, for Vans Old Skool we see the first trough period lasting 53 months - from April 2008 through August 2012, following several months of elevated search/interaction. The second peak and trough periods (which are easier to speak to given how recent it was) are equally telling. In the mid-Twenty- Teens Van's ""Old Skool"" enjoyed a solid 49-month stretch of growth in search/interaction with low- pro sneakers benefiting from fashion trends at that time (Stan Smith's saw a bump at that time too) - at the expense of Nike's high top dominated lineup. However, as Nike re-invigorated innovation and as the fashion cycle changed in Nike's favor, Vans went through a 68-month trough period, from September 2018 - April 2024. So, when looking at Vans Old Skool over the past 20 years, we have two meaningful downtrends in search activity (2008-2012 and 2018-2024) which went on for 50-70 months. Relative to Old Skool's 49-month favorable run, Dunk actually had the longest favorable run at 50 months (Jun '19 - Jul '23) followed by AF1 at 38 months (Jun '17 - Jul '20) with AJ1 clocking-in at 26 months (Mar '19 - Apr '21). Unsurprisingly, NKE's peaks overlay with Old Skool's and Stan Smith's trough periods.

Interestingly, after that 35-month peak we then see a 36-month trough period from January 2017 (only 1 month after that first peak period ended) through December 2019. The second peak and trough occurred almost immediately thereafter - though with a much shorter peak at 27 months (Jan '20 - Mar '22) followed by a longer trough (41 months: Apr '22 - Aug '25).

Turning to NKE, we think about how this might help guide us on the current down spiral of their Classics. A similar analysis shows AF1 currently in its 63rd month of YoY declines in Google search trends and AJ1 in its 54th month - each very much in line with trough periods for Old Skool, and actually already past the declines historically seen at Stan Smith. In our view, this supports management's comments that trends in these two key franchises (remember - AJ1 and AF1 are much larger in size / importance than Dunk) are stabilizing and finding a bottom. That said, Dunk appears only 26 months into a correction based on Google search - which also fits with recent commentary that work on this silhouette remains.

Wholesale declined 1% (consider the relative out-performance of wholesale in the broader context). • 2Q25 CC: A number of these actions we had underway and Elliott has provided a perspective that we accelerate them. And some of these actions are new actions, like moving more aggressively to reposition NIKE Direct and NIKE Digital, in particular, as a premium channel. • 3Q25 CC: Wholesale increased 3%, due primarily to favorable shipment timing and increased shipments to our value partners in the third quarter. • 2Q25 10-Q: changes in channel mix and higher discounts • 3Q25 10-Q: lower ASP... Lower ASP primarily reflects higher discounts and changes in channel mix Conclusion We see revenue headwinds to NA wholesale in 2Q (~8% impact) and 3Q (~11.5% impact) - with 3Q being the larger quarter. This implies potential headwinds to total NKE revenue of 50-100bps in 2Q and 200-300bps in 3Q.

Reserves, Charges, Obsolescence... Oh My!",41,13,14,"In these next two sections we move from a NA view to a total company view to breakdown the the step-function change in GM declines from 1H25 to 2H25. As a reminder, total company GMs were actually up +115bps in 1Q25 and down ""only"" 100bps in 2Q25. The situation changed considerably in 2H, with GM declining 385bps in 3Q25 and 445bps in 4Q25. We see two large drivers of the sequential deterioration. First, the ""Other"" bucket comprised of inventory and sales reserves and obsolescence/charges (which we discuss here) and the impact of rightsizing Nike Direct (which we discuss next). We acknowledge that digging into NKE's accounting and reserve balances can be difficult, but below we do our best to break down the estimates and impacts that occurred over the past 12-18 months. First, a quick recap of the impact from reserves and obsolescence by quarter. NKE reported: • 1Q ~60bps (or ~$70M) • 2Q ~70bps (or ~$85M) • 3Q ~90bps (or ~$100M) • FY ~90bps (or ~$450M) We calculate the total FY25 impact of ~90bps at ~$450M - which allows us to back into a 4Q25 charge of ~$200M, or ~175bps - by far the largest impact of the year. Next (second) it's important to understand the 3 main drivers of the ""Other"" costs: 1) Inventory reserves, 2) Sales reserves and 3) Obsolescence. We think a quick accounting recap of inventory reserves is helpful - from the NKE 10-K: “If the net realizable value of inventory is estimated to be less than the cost of the inventory, a reserve is recorded equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. As of May 31, 2025, the Company's inventory reserve was $233 million compared to $155 million as of May 31, 2024. “ Thus, we calculate the $78M negative change in inventory reserves as -20bps of the overall -90bps impact in FY25 - leaving -70bps to explain. The impact from sales reserves is not as straight-forward, with multiple moving pieces, but we note that the step-up from $799M in FY24 to $1,277M resulted Equity Research | 13 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research in $478M of contra-revenue (there is an offsetting adjustment to COGS). As such, we estimate the unfavorable change in sales reserves as another -20bps - implying that obsolescence was the largest piece, at -50bps, based on our assumptions. Here, we'd note that NKE specifically called out “Higher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points), including higher inventory obsolescence reserves” in the 10-K. The fact that NKE called out inventory obsolescence specifically suggests it was the biggest piece of the total 90bps, in our view (NKE also called out ""discounts to liquidate aged inventory"" on its 4Q25 call).",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Upgrading_to_OW_w-_-75_PT-_Visibility_Now_Improving.pdf

In the context of an FY26 GM build we see China as a drag at least through the current quarter (-450bps, or -69bps to the total company) and at best neutral in 2H26 as clean up work continues, albeit against easier compares in 3Q (-760bps) and 4Q (-675bps). 14 | Equity Research NIKE, Inc. Equity Research Supporting 10-Q / CC Commentary • 1Q25 10-Q: “Gross margin contraction of approximately 170 basis points, largely due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, higher product costs and higher other costs, in part due to higher inventory obsolescence reserves” • 2Q25 10-Q: “Gross margin contraction of approximately 490 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower ASP, reflecting higher discounts and product mix” (our note: starting to see impact of lower ASP show up as a catalyst) • 3Q25 10-Q: “Gross margin contraction of approximately 580 basis points, reflecting higher inventory obsolescence reserves and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher ASP. Higher ASP primarily reflects strategic pricing actions” (our note: feels like NKE “threw in the towel” and took write downs to try and stop the continuous discounting) • 4Q25 CC: “Greater China executed a deeper reset of inventory relative to our other geographies with higher sales related reserves, higher discounts and supply reductions.” Conclusion – Building Up a Reasonable FY26 Bull Case Here, we bring it all together and think about ""what could be"" were a more bullish scenario to play out for NKE over the balance of the current FY, and then compare that to Street estimates. Given the multitude of catalysts (both good and bad) and the timing differences we also think it's helpful to see all of the moving pieces that could play out in the coming quarters (Ex 22 below). We'll start below with the negative catalysts before recapping the positive ones.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Upgrading_to_OW_w-_-75_PT-_Visibility_Now_Improving.pdf

While favorable for NKE's performance running platforms, this does extend the headwind on Classics clean- up, and suggests a more indirect investment in athletics (though our checks noted the investment potentially grows TAM from 450M people in China to 650M next few years - which would be a LT positive for NKE).

We also take a cautiously-optimistic view in 1H27, where we forecast China GM +75bps and +125bps in 1Q27 and 2Q27, before getting a bit more aggressive in 2H27. We then weight the China-specific GM recapture at just over 15%, based on China's % of total company gross profit in FY25. Said another way - we do not see a meaningful improvement in trends for ~5 quarters, and even then believe that any improvement is based on some level of normalization - not on a return to growth.

One of the first things CEO Hill spoke about in this regard is the culture. While this is a fairly broad statement, Hill elaborated on his view that ""culture"" is about several key dynamics that need to be in place in order to drive the Nike brand - putting sport back at the center of everything they do, taking insights from their athletes and turning that into great product and improving storytelling behind their consumer led marketplace (with Direct and Wholesale working together). Elaborating further, over the years NKE had shifted to a mentality of a tech company vs. sports company. Too much reliance on data and analytics, which was a mistake. This led to poor decision-making and created the current marketplace issues that exist today. ""We’ve been in this situation before and will work our way through it over time.""

Notably, they are shifting back towards having the mentality of a sports company (and away from a tech company) with a greater focus on art vs. science. 2) Shifting into sport-led teams (which move at a faster pace) to accelerate a complete product portfolio across 10 different sports spanning footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories (and analyzing how growth in each separate category rolls up to the total company) — with opportunities not only from product innovation but also merchandising. 3) Shifting investments back towards creating demand for brands (with demand creation close to 10% of revenue) by creating strong marketing stories and emotionally connecting with consumers during important sports moments and product launches—with the teams currently building anticipation for new launches and shifting spend from performance marketing to brand marketing. 4) Building back an integrated marketplace (wholesale), after it was de-prioritized due to a focus on digital revenue, and managing inventory across the marketplace by liquidating aged inventory to create space to sell new assortments and innovation coming in Fall and Holiday 2025. 5) Investing in specialty channels, including running and football (soccer)—and engaging with wholesale partners to build out a pipeline off innovative products across all sports and price points, while reducing weeks of supply to increase full-price selling.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Upgrading_to_OW_w-_-75_PT-_Visibility_Now_Improving.pdf

China Remains a Headwind (No Longer a Tailwind). After several years of very strong growth,76,22,22,"China slowed materially post-COVID on a number of issues. Local companies like Anta (Salomon also gets a tailwind from its Anta association) and Li Ning have raised their own game in terms of sneaker technology, are able to price well below Nike—and have benefited from a cultural shift to China-centric companies. At the same time newer competitors like On and Hoka have also captured share in China on the rise of trail and road running, at the expense of basketball. These companies' focus on sport/technology has lead to lifestyle success as well - mirroring broader trends in athletic participation. We expect the sales headwind to persist through summer 2026 (FY27) and believe any improvement in profitability is driven more by margin normalization rather than a return to growth. That said, recapture potential is significant - with operating margins down (1,500)bps over the last four years and (725)bps over the last two.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251120_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_Upgrading_to_OW_w-_-75_PT-_Visibility_Now_Improving.pdf

Equity Research Exhibit 29 - The Bull vs Bear ""Tug of War"" The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on NKE shares are focused on: (1) favorable risk-reward at current levels — NKE remains one the strongest softlines brands in the space that, while experiencing some transitory challenges, still has the key long-term opportunities intact; (2) ""new"" CEO Elliot Hill is aggressively cleaning inventory and removing stale product from the market, (3) numbers have been reset and sentiment remains low; and (4) with marketplace inventories eventually clean NKE can refocus on growth, now driven internally through sport - which allows for focused innovation, marketing and community connection. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on NKE shares are likely focused on: (1) NT outlook to remain choppy—global demand very different across geographies and each on separate timelines; (2) China is structurally challenged with headwinds persisting longer than expected; (3) NT issues exacerbated by strong competitors such as ON and HOKA in the US and local brands in China (along with recent strength by Salomon and Arc'Teryx; and (4) global sport and fitness has transitioned more towards trail running and outdoor sport relative to ""indoor"" sports where NKE has historically found success.

(NKE) Investment Thesis We rate NKE Overweight. We believe a few things are happening: 1) Visibility is improving into NKE's revamped strategies (numbers are bottoming), 2) Material green shoots are appearing (innovation) and 3) Significant headwinds from ""Classics"" clean up should start to dissipate in the coming quarters. We can finally begin to map out realistic ""return to growth"" forecasts, while sizable margin levers likewise take hold. Target Price Valuation for NKE: $75.00 from $60.00 Our $75 price target is based on a ~30x P/E on our FY27E EPS. This is a slight premium to NKE's history, closer to a ""recovery"" multiple on trough earnings which we believe accurately reflects current headwinds vs. upside potential. We believe that ongoing opportunities for rev growth, margin expansion and FCF generation justify our target multiples, though we do see many near-term puts and takes around revenue/margin. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for NKE Downside risks: (1) new innovation (along w/ franchise reset) does not drive topline; (2) global demand remains tepid; and (3) the transition back to wholesale from DTC causes more material headwinds to profits in the NT. Upside risks include a positive turn in Chinese consumption trends and better than expected performance in US clearance activity on both sales and margins.

WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.

King of the Hill. Just over one year ago NKE named their next leader—a 30+ year NKE veteran,",5,3,3,"Elliot Hill returns to the company and has played out several initiatives where he'd like to focus. One of the first things CEO Hill spoke about in this regard is the culture. While this is a fairly broad statement, Hill elaborated on his view that ""culture"" is about several key dynamics that need to be in place in order to drive the Nike brand—putting sport back at the center of everything they do, taking insights from their athletes and turning that into great product and improving storytelling behind their consumer led marketplace (with Direct and Wholesale working together). Elaborating further, over the years NKE had shifted to a mentality of a tech company vs. sports company. Too much reliance on data and analytics, which was a mistake. This led to poor decision-making and created the current marketplace issues that exist today. ""We’ve been in this situation before and will work our way through it over time."" Certainly not pleased with their financial performance over the past few years, Hill has stated that the strategy was off, execution was off and while the organization did put a number of actions into place 12+ months, he believes there remains several areas where they simply need to move faster.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251125_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_-Bull_vs._Bear-_Recap-_LT_vs._NT_Keeps_the_Debate_G.pdf

More on Recent Initiatives. 1) NKE (and Hill) is reigniting their culture by leading with sports,6,3,3,"(with more athlete and team collaborations) and inviting more consumers into the sport world — while putting athletes at the center of decisions again (pivoting away from lifestyle). Notably, they are shifting back towards having the mentality of a sports company (and away from a tech company) with a greater focus on art vs. science. 2) Shifting into sport-led teams (which move at a faster pace) to accelerate a complete product portfolio across 10 different sports spanning footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories (and analyzing how growth in each separate category rolls up to the total company) — with opportunities not only from product innovation but also merchandising. 3) Shifting investments back towards creating demand for brands (with demand creation close to 10% of revenue) by creating strong marketing stories and emotionally connecting with consumers during important sports moments and product launches—with the teams currently building anticipation for new launches and shifting spend from performance marketing to brand marketing. 4) Building back an integrated marketplace (wholesale), after it was de-prioritized due to a focus on digital revenue, and managing inventory across the marketplace by liquidating aged inventory to create space to sell new assortments and innovation coming in Fall and Holiday 2025. 5) Investing in specialty channels, including running and football (soccer)—and engaging with wholesale partners to build out a pipeline off innovative products across all sports and price points, while reducing weeks of supply to increase full-price selling.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251125_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_-Bull_vs._Bear-_Recap-_LT_vs._NT_Keeps_the_Debate_G.pdf

China Remains a Headwind (No Longer a Tailwind). After several years of very strong growth,7,3,3,"China slowed materially post-COVID on a number of issues. Local companies like Anta (Salomon also gets a tailwind from its Anta association) and Li Ning have raised their own game in terms of sneaker technology, are able to price well below Nike—and have benefited from a cultural shift to China-centric companies. At the same time newer competitors like On and Hoka have also captured share in China on the rise of trail and road running, at the expense of basketball. These companies' focus on sport/technology has led to lifestyle success as well—mirroring broader trends in athletic participation. We expect the sales headwind to persist through summer 2026 (FY27) and believe any improvement in profitability is driven more by margin normalization rather than a return to growth. That said, recapture potential is significant—with operating margins down (1,500)bps over the last four years and (725)bps over the last two.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251125_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_-Bull_vs._Bear-_Recap-_LT_vs._NT_Keeps_the_Debate_G.pdf

Financial Headwinds Could Start to Slow in 2H26. While not out of the woods yet (we forecast,8,3,3,"an additional $1.5B of clearance through 1Q27) we do believe the rate of change slows for NKE after 2Q26 ($800M of the remaining $1.5B). Further, we do see greenshoots in footwear ex- Classics (+25% YoY 1Q26) and NKE's ""Rest of Business"" (+3% in 1Q26). However, we see GM recapture as the key near-term driver. NKE has absorbed a significant amount of cost, in multiple ways, cleaning up Classics footwear (we estimate $6B total revenue headwind). These include impacts to 1) channel mix and margin rates within channels—incremental sell-in to closeout,",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251125_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_-Bull_vs._Bear-_Recap-_LT_vs._NT_Keeps_the_Debate_G.pdf

Equity Research | 3 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on NKE shares. Exhibit 1 - The Bull vs Bear ""Tug of War"" The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on NKE shares are focused on: (1) favorable risk-reward at current levels—NKE remains one the strongest softlines brands in the space that, while experiencing some transitory challenges, still has the key long-term opportunities intact; (2) ""new"" CEO Elliot Hill is aggressively cleaning inventory and removing stale product from the market, (3) numbers have been reset and sentiment remains low; and (4) with marketplace inventories eventually clean NKE can refocus on growth, now driven internally through sport—which allows for focused innovation, marketing and community connection. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on NKE shares are likely focused on: (1) NT outlook to remain choppy—global demand very different across geographies and each on separate timelines; (2) China is structurally challenged with headwinds persisting longer than expected; (3) NT issues exacerbated by strong competitors such as ON and HOKA in the US and local brands in China (along with recent strength by Salomon and Arc'Teryx; and (4) global sport and fitness has transitioned more towards trail running and outdoor sport relative to ""indoor"" sports where NKE has historically found success. Financial Outlook FY26E: Our FY26E EPS estimate is $1.70 representing EPS -21.5%. We are projecting total sales +1.6%. We are projecting gross margin down ~135bps, to 41.4%, and we expect SG&A to grow +2.0% in dollars, to ~35%. As a result, we expect operating margin to contract ~175bps, to 6.4%. FY27E: We forecast FY27 EPS of $2.40 representing EPS +41.3%. We're projecting total sales +4.4% and gross margin up ~100bps to 42.4%. We expect SGA to grow +2% in dollars but see (80)bps of leverage to 34.1%. As a result we forecast operating margin to expand +186bps to 8.3% 4 | Equity Research NIKE, Inc.

Nike Still the No. 1 Sneaker Choice,0,1,1,"Nike is the top sneaker manufacturer, propelled by exceptional consumer loyalty and intent. About 57% of consumers said it was one of the top three sneakers they wore in the past 12 months, roughly 54% have purchased its sneakers over the same period and about 47% plan to buy the brand in the next six months. These figures are slightly below our May survey, when 60% named Nike among their top-three worn, 59% had purchased its sneakers and 53% planned to buy the brand in the next six months. Still, Nike is ahead of its competitors, including Adidas and New Balance, according to BI's proprietary survey. With over half of respondents favoring Nike, its rare dominance across all three metrics positions it strongly to rebuild and deepen customer loyalty through upcoming product innovations.

Nike's direct-to-consumer (DTC) push is vital to its turnaround, with nearly 60% of shoppers who bought Nike in the past 12 months purchasing sneakers directly from the brand -- down from 66% in May but still ahead of other retail channels. This clear preference underscores the effectiveness of Nike's own stores and digital platforms in building engagement, trust and loyalty. Though the company is increasing its wholesale push, the DTC focus is still intact, as it's essential for maintaining brand control, protecting margins and gaining valuable consumer data that support personalization and innovation. Innovation and product-pipeline improvements will be key to reigniting DTC growth. DTC sales may decline by double-digits in fiscal 2026 as it works to clear excess and outdated inventory, but could revert to gains in 1H27.

Nike leads in every category, from running and basketball to casual wear and commuting, and holds the largest share in key performance areas such as running, basketball, soccer and gym/fitness. It also outperforms other brands in non-athletic use like lifestyle and errands. Adidas ranks a consistent second across most categories and New Balance is strong in running and fitness.

Nike’s Sweet Spot for Sneakers Is $100-$250,3,3,3,"Nike's core offerings are priced strategically to resonate with sneaker enthusiasts. According to the BI athleisure survey, the $100-$250 price is accessible and appealing to most buyers. About 27% of consumers who purchased Nike in the past 12 months choose casual/lifestyle and athletic sneakers in this tier, making it the most dominant price bracket across all generations. This reflects a strong willingness to invest in midrange sneakers that offer quality, brand prestige and value. Maintaining a strong presence in this range can help Nike regain market share and deepen consumer loyalty. Most of its new launches might remain in this tier, even with planned price increases due to tariffs. Its recent A'One ""Royal Flame"" model debuted at $115, highlighting a commitment to innovation at an accessible price.

Caitlin Clark's signature shoe could release next year, but Nike released a Kobe 6 Proto ""Caitlin Clark"" colorway in November to capture demand, with the shoe now only on resale sites. At lower prices, models like the Air Superfly ($105) and Pegasus 41 ($145) bring performance benefits to everyday consumers. This layered strategy underscores Nike’s ability to blend technology with cultural momentum, reinforcing its strength across multiple price points.

Downward Revisions Appear to Be Finished,5,4,4,"Years of downgrades have likely come to an end, with the latest projecting a slight gain in fiscal 2026 revenue for Nike, and estimates might start to come up after its stronger fiscal 1Q. The reduced sales consensus looks achievable at a minimum, with innovation and sports events offering potential to boost brand momentum. With downward revisions ebbing, projections can begin to reflect fiscal 2026 improvements. We expect a slight upside to consensus for fiscal 2026 sales on a stronger 2H, while 2027 sales could reach $50 billion. A greater focus on wholesale partnerships, especially with Foot Locker, might improve assortment and spur growth. Its Amazon.com partnership and new NikeSKIMS brand can also fuel sales.

Riding China's Growing Yoga, Training Gear Demand",0,1,1,"Lululemon and Anta's Maia Active are well-positioned to capture Chinese consumers' growing appetite for specialist yoga and training gear in 2026. They posted steeper online sales growth in October-November than Nike, Adidas, Anta and other multisport brands, based on Tmall, JD.com and Douyin data collected by Shang Zhi Zhen, reflecting strong demand for the brands. Lululemon doubling its sales in the period further raises the likelihood that it can reach the upper end of its 20-25% sales-growth target for China this year if demand in higher-tier cities stabilizes. Lower-than-expected February-July sales, along with expectations that a late Lunar New Year holiday -- in February 2026 vs. January this year -- will delay festive purchases, prompted Lululemon to cut its 2025 China sales-growth goal from 25-30% on Sept. 5.

Lululemon Discounts to Aid Product Reset Ahead,1,1,2,"Lululemon can reach the higher end of its 2025 sales-growth target if it keeps discounts elevated through January while using 2026's product reset to normalize markdowns thereafter. The company's 18% average online discount in October-November, though low vs. multisport peers, according to Shang Zhi Zhen data, was almost double last year's level. This was likely driven by clearance of older, casual and lounge inventory before a refreshed 2026 assortment, which is expected to lift new-style penetration from 23% to about 35% globally by next spring.

Shang Zhi Zhen data showed Lululemon's Tmall sales rose 115% year over year in October-November, while Douyin sales surged 193%. By contrast, Anta's lower- priced Maia Active is more reliant on Douyin, where its sales jumped 138% versus just 2% growth on Tmall over the same period. Tmall will likely step up investments in content-based e-commerce such as live-streaming and short videos to boost engagement with consumers and fend off competition from social commerce platform Douyin.

We believe a FY2Q26 beat is likely as guidance and estimates are sufficiently low and already embed tariff Market Cap (USD mn) 93924 risk. For FY2Q26, we expect NKE to beat, with sales better-than-expectations driven by the Shares Outstanding (mn) 1478.20 wholesale channel. NKE guidance was for negative low single-digit (including 1 point from Free Float (%) 98.71 FX) versus the Street of -1.2%. We expect upside in the wholesale channel – driven by restocking 52 Wk Avg Daily Volume (mn) 15.8 – and sequential improvement in the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel as the company is in Dividend Yield (%) 2.59 the final stages of liquidating classic inventory that had been returned to NKE from the Return on Equity TTM (%) 21.12 marketplace. We expect gross margins to be better than consensus of -300bps and guidance for Current BVPS (USD) 9.12 -300bps to -375bps. For FY2Q26, sentiment remains cautious, but is not nearly as negative as it Source: Bloomberg was entering last quarter. We believe that investors will be focused on: 1) what management expects for the holiday season, 2) DTC performance and response to new innovation and Price Performance Exchange-NYSE products in the channel, and 3) timing of a return to sustained top-line growth. 52 Week range USD 82.44-52.28 FY2H26 lower sales, higher margins: NKE provides quarter-by-quarter guidance, which will be effectively FY2H26 guidance. For FY2H26, while no official annual guidance is expected, we do expect commentary to potentially reflect a slightly lower-than-consensus top line, which may need to be tempered. Consensus expectations are for a return to positive sales growth in FY3Q26 up +1.5% and FY4Q26 up +3.3%. We believe sales may be capped by a more disciplined restocking of the wholesale channel and pressure on sales (but not margins) from the DTC Source: IDC channel. We believe sales growth may be below consensus with a great deal more margin Link to Barclays Live for interactive charting expansion potential. Last year's liquidation of products likely spurred top-line growth at the expense of margins, and as this anniversaries, we should see margin expansion before sales U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & recovery. Footwear Adrienne Yih FY26 largely unchanged, with FY2Q26 upside offset by FY2H26 potential tempering.

We believe the Street's forecast for a return to MSD top-line growth in FY27 and FY28 and ~400bps of operating margin expansion from FY26 to FY28 remains aggressive and that estimates for the out years may be overly optimistic. Turns are iterative in nature, and we typically see margin recovery before sales recovery in sequence but rarely both at the same time. Wholesale channel recovers by ""seasons"" not ""quarters."" FY2H25 felt the worst pressure from the company's reset actions, and from this point forward we expect a stutter-step type recovery, led first by wholesale channel restocking. In FY1H26, we saw improvement in sequential sales offset by margin pressure. The classics franchise management negatively impacted margins in FY1H26 with potential for back-half margin improvement as the company finalizes its clean up of the marketplace. Entering FY2H26, we expect the opposite – margins before sales – with sequential improvement on margins outpacing a return to positive sales growth. We note that GM may continue to be pressured despite its reset actions due the timing of tariffs flowing through. Despite a turnaround strategy that is executing on management’s internal plan, we see more pressure in the near term, which could be exacerbated by the overhang of tariff pressures and demand uncertainty over the next few quarters. Longer-term, NKE moving towards recovery. Longer term, from a fundamental standpoint (ex-tariffs) NKE continues to execute on its re-balancing initiatives, such as driving its product newness cycle, innovation at scale, and marketing efforts across the company. We believe a return to sustained positive sales growth, led by wholesale, is more likely in FY1H27. Reiterate EW as we see NKE range-bound as a ""prove it to me"" story for CY26. Thus far and in our view, Mr. Hill's vision highlights three key priorities: 1) product, 2) marketing, and 3) marketplace, which are expected to drive Nike's return to profitable and healthy growth. Mr. Hill is expediting innovation through the company's express lane and pulling forward as much commercial-ready product as possible, while the product launches are being supported with Nike-branded demand creation. We certainly believe that redirecting Nike’s large asset base and budget will ultimately lead to market share recovery and top-line growth. However, in the near term, the reset actions will likely take a toll on profit margins and sales growth throughout FY26, as NKE's issues are not short-horizon fixes. Raising FY2Q26; FY estimates remain below-consensus; PT remains $70. Our FY26, FY27, and FY28 adj. EPS estimates are $1.52, $2.30, and $2.81, respectively, (from $1.35, $2.19, and $2.65) but remain 8% to 10% below consensus of $1.68, $2.51, and $3.05. Our still-below consensus estimate increase is largely driven by expected FY2Q26 upside and higher GM as the company laps meaningful margin pressure in FY2H26 related to the increase in promo and liquidation efforts which began in earnest in FY2H25. Our PT of $70 (unchanged) is based on 27x (was 29x) applied to our CY27 EPS estimate of $2.59 (from $2.43). We expect NKE shares to trade range-bound until there is evidence of market share gain acceleration and full-price driven selling. We lower our multiple 2x as we believe a sustained profitable top-line recovery will take longer to evolve and FY27 and FY28 consensus margin expansion may prove too aggressive. 10 December 2025 2 Barclays | Nike, Inc.

Proprietary PRISM Curve: NKE Fundamentals Are Bottoming From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of a potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 1 and Figure 2 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe NKE is in the latter stage of the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises. As market share erodes, the lack of sales is causing operating deleverage. During the TRAP phase, management’s strategy is on the defensive – meaning actions are being taken to change business trends, but the issues have not yet stabilized. The ESCAPE Phase We look for evidence that NKE will transition into the ESCAPE phase in FY2H26 in which issues have been identified and are being proactively corrected. At some point, a company’s management makes the changes necessary to correct problems at the business, and the company passes the negative-to-positive inflection point. During the ESCAPE phase, management’s strategy is on the offense. They are actively taking measures to stem losses and stabilize market share. They are focused on driving full-price, healthy sales and likely will have ratcheted back inventory; they are less focused on their competitors’ actions or the environment around them. Typically, a company will move past this point by driving comps with better merchandising and improved inventory management (growing inventory below sales plan). At this point, a company is not yet showing direct signs that fundamentals are currently improving; instead, it is showing signs that fundamentals are stabilizing and are becoming “less bad.” Management is willing to make difficult strategic decisions, and fundamentals are likely to begin improving in the near future. As the company moves further to the right, it is continuing to comp negatively, but less so, and begins to show marginal signs of improvement. During the ESCAPE phase, we typically see a margin recovery before we see a return to sustainable positive sales growth. FIGURE 1.

The sequence of recoveries is typically a 3-year horizon – Reset in Year 1 (FY25A), Rebase in Year 2 (FY26E), and Regrow in Year 3 (FY27E). The Rebase year is often a stutter-step year as a company stabilizes the business to return to profitable growth. With NKE a battleground stock, we lay out our catalyst roadmap for the next several quarters as we see them playing out. We leave it for different investor styles, risk, and horizons to determine when to time the “buy” of the stock. As for us, we remain sidelined with expectation of downside revision risk. While we rely heavily on a positive inflection in the sales-to-inventory spread, we note that a positive inflection in the sales-to-inventory growth spread assumes sales growth is, at worst, status quo to current trends. On the FY1Q26 call, the IM Spread did indeed inflect positively, but management commentary suggested recent weaker trends in Greater China and APAC. FY2Q26 beat: For FY2Q26, we expect NKE to beat with sales better-than-expected driven from the wholesale channel. NKE guidance was for negative low single-digit (including 1 point from FX), versus the Street of -1.2%. We expect upside in the wholesale channel – driven by restocking – and sequential improvement in the Direct-to- Consumer (DTC) channel as the company is in the final stages of liquidating classics inventory that had been returned to NKE from the marketplace in FY1H26. We expect gross margins slightly better than consensus of -300bps and guidance for -300bps to -375bps. FY2H26 lower sales, higher margins: NKE provides quarter-by-quarter guidance, which will be effectively FY2H26 guidance. For FY2H26, while no official annual guidance is expected, we do expect commentary to potentially reflect slightly lower-than-consensus top line, which may need to be tempered. Consensus expectations are for a return to positive sales growth in FY3Q26 of up +1.5% and FY4Q26 of up +3.3%. We believe sales may be capped by the more disciplined restocking of the wholesale channel and pressure on sales (but not margins) in the DTC channel. Instead of positive LSD sales growth in FY2H26, we have slightly positive sales growth with a great deal more margin expansion potential. Last year's liquidation of products likely spurred top-line growth at the expense of margins, and as this anniversaries, we should see margin expansion before sales recovery. FY26 largely unchanged with FY2Q26 upside offset by FY2H26 lowering. In our view, FY26 will likely be a slightly down top-line year, with significant improvement in product margins and operating margins in the second half of FY26. Risk is to FY27 and FY28. We believe the Street's forecast for a return to MSD topline growth in FY27 and FY28 and 400bps of operating margin expansion from FY26 to FY28 remains aggressive and that estimates for the out years may be overly optimistic. Turns are iterative in nature and we typically see margin recovery before sales recovery in sequence and rarely both at the same time. 10 December 2025 9 Barclays | Nike, Inc. FIGURE 4.

Bull vs. Bear Debate Bull view. We think the Bull case is predicated on the following points: 1) the Nike brand with its ~$5bn of demand creation and innovation strength can invest its way back to market share dominance; 2) new leadership in Elliott Hill with 32+ years of experience in all facets of the Nike business model can reinvigorate not only the brand, but also the corporate culture to drive results; 3) Nike remains the #1 brand globally; 4) channel partners are heavily reliant on Nike’s long-term success; and 5) low expectations with FY26 to be a ""transition"" year. Key positive data points include the following: • Early Spring Order Book: The company is expected to discuss the Spring order book (March 2026), which should be up on a year-over-year basis. This is because they were pulling inventory out of the wholesale marketplace and returning it to vendors in FY3Q25 and",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251216_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY2Q26_Preview-_Upside_to_Quarter-_Still_See.pdf

Bear view. We think the Bear case has the following main points: 1) the loss of NKE's historical brand heat and momentum as the company struggles to innovate at scale; 2) unproven and untested product driving future sales into calendar 2026; 3) ongoing margin pressure from negative sales growth, the mix shift to wholesale, promotional pressure, and tariff headwinds, all leading to sub-10% operating margins for the foreseeable future; and 4) competitive threats from new entrants. Key risk data points include the following: 10 December 2025 10 Barclays | Nike, Inc. • Sales-to-Inventory Spread inflected positive in FY1Q26, but non-US sales slowed further: The sales-to-inventory spread, or inventory management spread (""IM Spread""), is a starting point for margin recovery. This spread could be a leading indicator of anywhere from 6 to 9 months to show up on the income statement. While we rely heavily on a positive inflection in the sales-to-inventory spread, we note that a positive inflection in sales-to- inventory growth spread assumes sales growth is, at worst, status quo to current trends. On the FY1Q26 call, the IM Spread did indeed inflect positive, but management commentary suggested recent weaker trends in Greater China and APAC. • FY2H26 Sales Growth Expectations May be Too Optimistic: We believe the consensus expectations for FY3Q26 sales to be up +1.5% and FY4Q26 sales to be up +3.3% may be too optimistic. This suggests that the anticipated recovery in sales may not materialize as expected. • Margins before Sales. Offsetting what we believe to be overly optimistic sales recovery expectations is likely better-than-consensus gross margin performance as NKE anniversaries aggressive reset and product liquidation measures from FY2H25. Often, when resetting the marketplace and inventory pipeline, companies will forego low-quality sales in lieu higher- quality full price selling. • Still see downward pressure on EPS Revisions: Our estimates remain below consensus expectations. We believe there could be at least one more downward FY2H26 revision for the back half driven by overly-optimistic sales forecasts (as noted above). 10 December 2025 11 Barclays | Nike, Inc. Four Catalysts We Watch for Recovery Catalyst #1: Positive sales-to-inventory inflection: CHECK! Occurred in FY1Q26. Based on our proprietary inventory analysis, NKE has posted one quarter of positive sales-to-inventory growth. In FY1Q26 the Inventory Management Spread (""IM Spread"") was 220 basis points and improved from (1055) in the prior quarter. NKE's Gross Margin Return on Inventory (""GMROI"") has worsened for five consecutive quarters, and its Operating Margin Return on Inventory (""OMROI"") has worsened for five consecutive quarters. While we rely heavily on a positive inflection in the sales-to-inventory spread, we note that a positive inflection in the sales-to- inventory growth spread assumes sales growth is, at worst, status quo to current trends. On the FY1Q26 call, the IM Spread did indeed inflect positively, but management commentary suggested recent weaker trends in Greater China and APAC.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251216_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY2Q26_Preview-_Upside_to_Quarter-_Still_See.pdf

Historical GMROI/OMROI Analysis, FY3Q08A - FY1Q26A",9,12,14,"Fiscal Year End May Source: Company data, Barclays Research Catalyst #2: Positive GM inflection supported by clean inventory and new product launches: Forecasted FY2H26. We look for evidence that margins and earnings have bottomed and NKE is entering a period of sustained ""beat-and-raise"" financial performance. The first P&L impact metric we look for is positive y/y merchandise margin inflection. We believe the return to GM inflection is centered on more full-price selling driven by cleaning up of the channel coupled with desirable and innovative brand heat products. Recall, we foresee six sources of margin pressure in FY26 from: 1) sales pressure as NKE resets the marketplace; 2) return of demand creation to ~10% of sales; 3) product and channel mix headwinds; 4) return of price concessions, offset by price increases to mitigate tariff impact, to drive wholesale channel restocking; 5) franchise management of AJ1, AF1, and especially Dunk; and 6) negative impact from 10 December 2025 12 Barclays | Nike, Inc. tariffs. With the reset actions most aggressively taken in FY2H25 and likely bleeding into FY1H26, we believe this could set up for margin improvement in FY2H26. Catalyst #3: Return to sustainable full-price sales growth; accelerating sales growth: Forecast FY4Q26/FY1Q27. NKE guided to overall FY2Q26 revenue to be down LSD (inclusive of a one point benefit from FX). Recall sales have been down for five out of the past 6 quarters. FY1Q26 had a surprise positive sales due to a pull forward of wholesale shipments. While the company is not back to growth, we see less fixed-cost deleverage as revenue trends make their way back towards a positive inflection. The rate of decline will likely continue to moderate, and we see potential for a return to profitable and sustainable revenue growth in FY1H27 as the company laps heavy clearance activity in FY2H26 and begins to return to full-price selling. Recall on the most recent call, management stated they ""expect a modest headwind to revenue in FY2H26 as they lap aggressive clearance activity in the prior year... the second half will be more full price, it will be more profitable, but there will be a revenue headwind from the compare to the higher level of off-price liquidation in the prior year."" Catalyst #4: Positive DTC inflection; sustained sales acceleration as brand recovers: Forecasted FY27. Evidence of a sustained brand recovery resides in the strength of the innovation pipeline driving positive growth in full-price selling in NKE's DTC channel . We look for evidence that reset actions have begun to materialize in results. Thus far, we know that CEO Elliott Hill is accelerating the product newness cycle, innovation at scale, and marketing efforts across the company under its “Win Now” strategy focusing on five fields of play, three countries, and five cities. We are beginning to see green shoots from the reset actions as early feedback from Nike's wholesale partners has been positive, evidenced by the company's wholesale order books improving sequentially with its holiday orders up in NA, EMEA, and APLA, offset by Greater China. We do point out that the holiday order book includes new points of wholesale distribution (or what we call ""non-comp wholesale"" doors such as Amazon) that add to the wholesale channel orders inflecting. We find this data point encouraging but still not concrete evidence of a sustained return to growth as order books do not always net to booked revenue growth. 10 December 2025 13 Barclays | Nike, Inc.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251216_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY2Q26_Preview-_Upside_to_Quarter-_Still_See.pdf

Tariff exposure update. Based on reciprocal tariff rates as of NKE's FY1Q26 call on 9/30/25, NKE raised its expected impact from tariffs on an annualized gross incremental cost basis to approx. $1.5bn (up from $1.0bn). The company expected the net headwind to GM to increase to 120bps (from 75bps) for FY26, with a 175bps impact to FY2Q26. The company continues to expect to mitigate these new costs over time. Prior tariff commentary. On the FY4Q25 call, NKE stated, ""Currently, China represents roughly 16% of the footwear we import into the United States. And we expect this to reduce to the high single-digit range by the end of fiscal '26, with supply from China reallocated to other countries around the world."" Management estimates FY26 unmitigated tariff expense at the current 30% China/10% rest of world to be $1bn with a net impact of ~100bps to FY1Q26 and ~75bps to FY26. Based on its most recent FY25 annual filings ""for fiscal 2025, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia, and China manufactured approximately 51%, 28% and 17% of total NIKE Brand footwear (Figure 8), respectively. For fiscal 2025, factories in Vietnam, China, and Cambodia manufactured approximately 31%, 15% and 15% of total NIKE Brand apparel (Figure 9), respectively."" Barclays Tariff ""QuikCalc"" Model assumptions. We provide our Tariff ""QuikCalc"" model analysis, which now assumes global tariff assumptions effective 8/7/25, resulting in an incremental ~$500m in gross tariff impact to FY26. Our prior tariff analysis assumed 30% China and 10% Rest of World (excluding Mexico and Canada). Note our estimate of Tariff on Goods Imported to the US is a gross unmitigated amount for a full year, and we calculate the price increase necessary to mitigate full tariff cost (absent other mitigation strategies). Our updated tariff calculator under 8/7/25 effective rates suggests that for NKE total average unit cost will increase by 8.3% with pass-through to the US market only increasing prices by 7.9% (see Figure 7). 10 December 2025 14 Barclays | Nike, Inc.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251216_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY2Q26_Preview-_Upside_to_Quarter-_Still_See.pdf

Pou Sheng / Pou Chen / Apptopia Analysis • Pou Sheng (China retailer) revenue was down -2.6% for September/October, a notable sequential improvement from down -10.2% in the prior three months. This sequential uptick suggests stabilization at the retail level and hints at a more resilient underlying China trend. • Supplier checks show combined revenue for Pou Chen and Feng Tay fell -7.7% in September/October, improving sequentially from down -9.6% in the prior three months. While still negative, the smaller drop suggests Nike’s inventory orders may be stabilizing. • Apptopia app data projects North America down -5%, in line with consensus. While NA is expected to lead the global brand recovery, growth will be challenged by lapping higher use of promos which could weigh on traffic.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251216_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY2Q26_Preview-_Upside_to_Quarter-_Still_See.pdf

What they did with the running construct around the 9-box and the Pegasus, and the Structure and Vomero have just been out of this world and how much market share they've picked up. I think Nike’s got a huge – it's great for our industry, it's great for our business. It's great for Nike too. But I think there's a lot of opportunity ahead with Nike."" DKS Earnings Call (11/25/25): • ""As previously announced, Ann Freeman, a long-time former Nike executive, is now serving as Foot Locker North America President. Ann brings deep industry expertise and leadership experience, and she is supported by a high-caliber team of senior leaders, a combination of key executives from Foot Locker, all of whom are well-respected by the Stripers, Blue Shirts, and our brand partners, experienced leaders from DICK'S, and talent from other world-class companies."" • ""In North America, as we talked about, it's being led by Ann Freeman, a long-time Nike executive that we've got a tremendous amount of respect for, and the brands have a tremendous amount of respect for."" • ""We just got Nike's running construct in last week, and when you take a look at some things like that, there's just a huge opportunity. That product is being sold at full price, so yes, we're really confident that there'll be a meaningful increase in their gross margin, and we'll give you some more color on that at the end of the fourth quarter."" DKS Conference Commentary (9/4/25): • ""So there are some brands that have come out with some really terrific product that's really kind of bought the consumer's interest, whether that's Nike's new running construct, which has been just fantastic around PEG structure and Vomero has been great."" • ""Went to a more Premium Footwear business, which gave us access to new products that Nike and some other brands wouldn't sell to us. So we changed our entire Footwear business."" JD Sports (covered by Richard Taylor) 1H26 Earnings Call (9/24/25): • ""On the other hand, running has moved back above the 50% mark where it was in financial year '20, especially with the development of performance running with On, Hoka, Salomon, Adidas Evo and the new Nike running product, Vomero 18 and Pegasus."" • ""... Asics, New Balance, Adidas are doing some really good stuff in the performance categories and we've seen some new product from Nike that's hit the ground running, pardon the pun."" ASO Earnings Call (12/9/25): • ""Lastly, investments in delivering more on-trend product for both Jordan Brand and Nike helped drive high-single digit growth in the combined brands and is helping bring in new higher income customers into Academy."" • ""We believe that our improved access to basketball game shoes from Jordan and performance running shoes from Nike such as the Vomero, coupled with the expansion of fashion apparel across both these brands, is helping us attract many of these new $100,000- plus households that I mentioned earlier in my remarks."" 10 December 2025 23 Barclays | Nike, Inc. • ""...depending upon the quarter, we've seen the combined Nike, Jordan grow in the high- single to low-double digits. I think you should expect that. We expect to happen again next year based off of further rollout of Jordan into more doors and continued access and rollout of more fashion product within Nike.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"": U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING RELATED RESEARCH There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.

We believe the stock's valuation reflects investor belief that FY26 earnings are depressed and do not represent the long-term EPS power of the company. We have a 12-month price target of $78, which is based on a low-30's P/E on calendar 2027 EPS of ~$2.45. Risks to the achievement of our target include 1) the global athleticwear market is extremely competitive and NKE may have difficult regaining traction with consumers, 2) the brand has been discounting heavily in recent years, and if those discounts prove to be ""sticky"", NKE could have difficulty expanding margins, 3) reinvigorating brand heat could require a bigger than expected investment in marketing and other overhead costs, limiting EBIT margin expansion, 4) China has long been a key market for NKE, but it has become a far more volatile region of late.

Consumption Softens as Subsidy Boost Fades,1,1,1,"China's 2025 retail-sales growth risks slipping below 4% as the boost from subsidies for autos and home appliances fades through December. November's weak 1.9% gain -- driven by an 11% slump in autos and home-appliance sales -- means December growth will likely fall short of 3%. This puts both full-year consensus for 4.5% growth and our 4.1% forecast at risk. Consensus estimates for 2026 growth of 4.6% are unlikely to be revised upward. Reaching 4.5% retail-sales growth in 2025 now requires a 9% year-on-year jump in December, or at least a 4% gain under our 4.1% forecast -- levels that hinge on continued strength in subsidized categories. Perks introduced in 2025 can buoy December sales in mobile phones, office goods and furniture, but without new incentives for autos and home appliances, these targets look lofty.

Assuming gold prices stay stable, demand for gold jewelry, which accounts for about half the category's sales, should stay firm through 1Q. The later Lunar New Year could extend the festive buying window by about 10 days. Within garments, footwear and accessories and branded luxury could lead with up to a 6% rebound in 2026 after two years of contraction. Pricier sportswear labels such as Arc’teryx, Salomon and Lululemon can also benefit from rising demand for specialized athletic gear.

Seizing More Specialized Sportswear Trends,5,3,4,"China's 2026 retail sales growth for clothing, shoes and related products are likely to lag behind that of non-subsidized consumer goods as Chinese consumers become more selective in their discretionary spending. However, labels with a strong brand presence -- such as those under Nike, Adidas, Anta's Fila -- can boost their sales with differentiated product lines. To capture Chinese consumers' gravitation toward more-specialized athletic gear, Nike, Adidas, Anta and Li Ning might need to pivot to more sports-led innovation and performance franchises to defend local market shares against fast-growing labels such as Lululemon, Arc'teryx and Salomon under Amer Sports in China. Lululemon and Anta's Maia Active are well-positioned to capture Chinese consumers' growing appetite for specialist yoga and training gear in 2026.

If incremental demand holds through December, China's cosmetics retail sales could rebound about 5% in 2025 after shrinking by more than 1% the previous year. Yet, part of this improvement likely reflects deeper online penetration by leading foreign brands such as L'Oréal, Estée Lauder and Shiseido rather than a broad-based recovery in discretionary demand. As China’s cosmetics market matures, brands will need sharper innovation and more effective engagement in the channels that matter most, especially online, to drive repeat purchases and defend market share.

Still, China continues to disappoint, needing further strategic direction to stop the sales slide. Executing on CEO Elliott Hill's ""Win Now"" strategy is even more important there, with a focus on innovation, sports and fresh inventory. Shorter lead times, refined wholesale partnerships, strategic pricing and digital engagement are levers to help Nike capitalize on early demand signals and reduce discounted sales. Headwinds include the impact of tariffs on costs and demand. (12/18/25) Key Topics Summary Near-Term Outlook Choppy:A weaker economy and lower direct-to-consumer sales are weighing on Nike, with consensus expecting total revenue to fall by low-single digits in fiscal 2026, with low- to mid-single-digit declines in 1H while sales in 2H could revert to gains. Gross margin might contract on higher markdowns to clear elevated inventory, tariff headwinds and shifts in channel mix, partly offset by price hikes and cost-mitigation efforts. Regions At Fore:Nike's sales may drop by a low-single-digit percentage in fiscal 2026, based on consensus, as economic weakness and higher markdowns to clear excess inventory crimp sales. Growth is expected to turn positive in 2H. Innovative products can help, but improving wholesale and direct-to-consumer momentum remains key to long-term growth and maintaining the top spot in global sportswear. Rebalancing Wholesale:Nike's bigger wholesale push leads us to believe its previous direct-to- consumer (DTC) penetration target of 60% of sales is unlikely as it emphasizes meeting customers where they are. Digital remains a focus, and e-commerce sales may rebound when unwanted inventory is cleared, driving higher full-price selling. Better wholesale partnerships with differentiated retailers are catalysts. This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

Women's Market Opportunity:Nike, already the largest women's athletic brand, has a chance to gain an even bigger portion of the fragmented sportswear market with designs specifically for the segment, along with targeted sponsorships and marketing. The company continues to dominate in sports bras, and its new leggings and footwear offerings could help it capture share. Sport Endorsements Key:Nike's bet on sponsorships and collaborations with top athletes and coaches could aid market share. Signing players like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson for the Jordan basketball brand, plus a German national team soccer-uniform contract, may boost sales. Building awareness can help drive revenue in less-penetrated markets and categories.

Gross Margin (%) Sports Still a Key Influence Nike's dominance in sports can keep fostering brand success, given its sponsorship of some of the highest-ranked teams and players in key leagues. During NCAA basketball's ""March Madness"" in 2025, Nike and its Jordan label sponsored 41 of 68 teams, down from 42 in 2024. It also outfitted six of the 32 teams in FIFA Club World Cup 2025, including the top two teams and six of the 16 squads in 2025 Women's UEFA Euro. The Paris 2024 Olympics last summer helped strengthen the brand, and it recently made a deal to sponsor the USA Gymnastics team through 2028. Nike also sponsors tennis players Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, ranked No. 1 in women's, top men's player Jannik Sinner of Italy and Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, rated second. This boosts the company's status at key tennis events like Wimbledon and the US Open. (07/21/25) FIFA Club World Cup Kit Makers This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

A greater focus on breadth of products by different business segments can help attract new shoppers and expand the reach of its new innovations.

Exposure to other countries is mostly lower across the group. Retailers like Best Buy have less direct control than manufacturers over inventory sourced from China or other countries.

Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026.

Still, China continues to disappoint, needing further strategic direction to stop the sales slide. Executing on CEO Elliott Hill's ""Win Now"" strategy is even more important there, with a focus on innovation, sports and fresh inventory. Shorter lead times, refined wholesale partnerships, strategic pricing and digital engagement are levers to help Nike capitalize on early demand signals and reduce discounted sales. Headwinds include the impact of tariffs on costs and demand. (12/18/25) Key Topics Summary Near-Term Outlook Choppy:A weaker economy and lower direct-to-consumer sales are weighing on Nike, with consensus expecting total revenue to fall by low-single digits in fiscal 2026, with low- to mid-single-digit declines in 1H while sales in 2H could revert to gains. Gross margin might contract on higher markdowns to clear elevated inventory, tariff headwinds and shifts in channel mix, partly offset by price hikes and cost-mitigation efforts. Regions At Fore:Nike's sales may drop by a low-single-digit percentage in fiscal 2026, based on consensus, as economic weakness and higher markdowns to clear excess inventory crimp sales. Growth is expected to turn positive in 2H. Innovative products can help, but improving wholesale and direct-to-consumer momentum remains key to long-term growth and maintaining the top spot in global sportswear. Rebalancing Wholesale:Nike's bigger wholesale push leads us to believe its previous direct-to- consumer (DTC) penetration target of 60% of sales is unlikely as it emphasizes meeting customers where they are. Digital remains a focus, and e-commerce sales may rebound when unwanted inventory is cleared, driving higher full-price selling. Better wholesale partnerships with differentiated retailers are catalysts. This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

Women's Market Opportunity:Nike, already the largest women's athletic brand, has a chance to gain an even bigger portion of the fragmented sportswear market with designs specifically for the segment, along with targeted sponsorships and marketing. The company continues to dominate in sports bras, and its new leggings and footwear offerings could help it capture share. Sport Endorsements Key:Nike's bet on sponsorships and collaborations with top athletes and coaches could aid market share. Signing players like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson for the Jordan basketball brand, plus a German national team soccer-uniform contract, may boost sales. Building awareness can help drive revenue in less-penetrated markets and categories.

A China turnaround is key as the market represents one of Nike's biggest sales and margin opportunities. Total 2Q revenue rose 1%, driven by gains of 9% in North America, 8% in wholesale and 4% in apparel, partly offset by declines in China, APLA and direct-to-consumer.

North America will remain the company's largest segment, though sales there may fall by low-double digits in fiscal 2025, outpacing expected declines in the Greater China and the Asia Pacific Latin America units. Greater breadth of products at its wholesale partners may boost sales in that segment, which comprises more than half of revenue.

Exposure to other countries is mostly lower across the group. Retailers like Best Buy have less direct control than manufacturers over inventory sourced from China or other countries.

These moves will influence margins through the rest of 2H and into 1H26, even after mitigation. Ralph Lauren stands out, as stronger sales and higher average prices more than offset tariff pressure. A 50% levy on India-made goods could pressure apparel margins. Abercrombie may be most exposed, with India, Vietnam and Cambodia making up 69% of sourcing, potentially cutting margins by over 200 bps this year. Gap, which sources 46% from Vietnam and Indonesia, expects a $150-$175 million hit (100-110 bps) after mitigation.

Many will prioritize volume stability over full tariff recovery. Our analysis suggests price increases of roughly 10-15% would be required to offset the earnings drag from current tariffs before any supply-chain shifts. Primark began lifting US prices in September, aiming merely for cash-cost recovery, while H&M is adjusting more cautiously to preserve competitiveness, expecting taxes to weigh on 4Q and 2026. Boohoo's earlier price increases have already led to weaker US demand, reinforcing elasticity concerns. Inditex reiterated stable gross-margin guidance on the back of proximity sourcing. Management tone remains cautious, signaling the tariff hit is building and not yet peaked. (10/22/25) This report may not be modified or altered in any way.

Estee Lauder and L'Oreal's 70%-plus gross margins, fed by low cost-of-goods models, explains their smaller hikes. Puig faces a larger mismatch, given its greater mix of high-end fragrances imported from Europe, but has stronger pricing power vs. most other categories. Coty has struggled to rely solely on pricing, due to weaker US mass-market demand and its launch-pipeline gaps. Cost-cutting could help, but Ebit stays pressured. Premium brands with market-share leadership have bargaining power to pass on some tariff costs to suppliers and retailers, if required.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated.

The steeper wholesale-revenue decline of 15% in 2Q sequentially versus 9% in the prior quarter, alongside management's indication of higher subsidies for retail partners such as Topsports and Yue Yuen's Pou Sheng, suggests Nike will keep new product shipments tight into summer 2026 as it clears aged inventory.

Yet Beijing's advisories against travel to Japan as well as Chinese airlines' seat cuts of more than 15% are slowing inbound traffic from China. Together, these twin macro headwinds leave Osaka- focused firms more vulnerable than their Tokyo-centric counterparts to the dip in Chinese visitors, while cosmetics companies could face sharper sales shortfalls than luxury goods in Japan.

A rise in consumer confidence can support domestic consumption through 2026 even as higher US tariffs limit the economic boost from Japanese exports. That said, escalating inflation in Japan could constrain the lift to retail sales from nominal wage hikes. Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 2.9% in September and 3% in October, remaining well above the Bank of Japan's target of 2%.

Drop in China Tourist Numbers Not Decisive,22,8,8,"Mainland Chinese tourists in Japan spent more on shoes, bags, leather goods and cosmetics than visitors from other places in the first nine months of 2025, based on quarterly surveys by the Japan Tourism Agency. Spending per Chinese visitor was 35% above the average for all overseas tourists in 3Q25, according to the latest survey. A reduction in Chinese visitors will therefore have an impact on luxury sales. But we don't think it will be decisive. Mainland Chinese spenders have been contributing under 25% of total Japanese receipts in those goods. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows a drop of say 15% in the number of Chinese visitors might cut overall receipts by over 3% -- significant, but not enough to collapse the market.

Contributing Analysts Elaine Lai (Consumer) China's appliance sector grew faster than expected in the first nine months of 2025. The resilience in the face of prolonged weakness in new home sales that typically drive purchases was largely due to government-funded consumer subsidy programs. Appliance demand generally falls into two categories: home-driven and replacement. Major appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators typically have a replacement cycle of 8- 10 years. This makes product innovation and upgrades critical for appliance makers seeking to shorten the cycle by encouraging consumers to replace appliances before they fail.

However, we believe subsidies will be smaller, and product coverage may change. Firms like Midea, Haier, Xiaomi, Ecovacs, and Roborock, which rode this year's subsidy-driven surge, may not have as much of a sales boost from the next wave of subsidies and will need to accelerate overseas expansion to offset domestic weakening. China’s finance ministry plans to issue ultra-long-term special bonds next year, with some funds earmarked for large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in programs, though it's still unclear how much funding would be allocated to subsidize home appliance purchases.

Platforms Balance Growth With Margin Focus,52,21,22,"Contributing Analysts Lea El-Hage (Asia Equities) Southeast Asia's e-commerce firms are poised to lift gross merchandise value in 2026 and sharpen their margin focus as the competitive dynamics between Shopee, TikTok Shop, Lazada, Temu and Taobao stabilize. Shopee is expanding by strengthening fulfillment capabilities and deepening rural-area penetration, which raise delivery costs and weigh on near-term gross margins, though they support more durable growth compared with just promotional spending. Shopee's selling and marketing costs to GMV fell to 2.7% in the first nine months from 2.9% a year earlier. Improving ad monetization, which will widen margins, should further offset cost pressures. Lazada's target to reach $100 billion in GMV by 2030 with a luxury focus reflects its intent to boost growth from higher-margin segments.

Shopee's Top Challenger Is TikTok Shop,53,22,22,"Contributing Analysts Lea El-Hage (Asia Equities) TikTok Shop will be Shopee's strongest rival in 2026 as it expands in Southeast Asia, though less aggressively. Its regional GMV was $19.2 billion in 1H, more than 3x the $5.8 billion in the US, based on Momentum Works data. Indonesia's GMV reached $6 billion, overtaking the US as the largest market. Temu, with a cross-border model, brings more price pressure, but compliance hurdles block its growth and it is expanding from a low base. Lazada is easing off aggressive share grabs. Shopee's edge is scale and in-house logistics, while TikTok Shop relies on third-party carriers. Shopee is the default intent-based marketplace versus TikTok's impulse-driven purchase model. Average monthly downloads on TikTok Shop's Seller Center app fell 24% in the first nine months, implying fewer merchant incentives and a greater profit focus.

Temu Expansion Hurt by Regulatory Barriers,54,22,22,"Contributing Analysts Lea El-Hage (Asia Equities) Temu's Southeast Asia expansion is constrained by regulatory concerns in Vietnam and Indonesia, despite rapid growth in other global markets. In Indonesia, the region's largest market, the platform was banned after failing to register under local digital-platform laws. Authorities said its factory-to-consumer model violated trade rules requiring distribution through local intermediaries or authorized distributors. Temu entered Vietnam in 2024, though it was ordered to suspend operations in December after missing the registration deadline amid concerns over its deep discounts and counterfeit goods.

Lazada's share slipped to about 14% from 16%, reflecting slower GMV growth as the company focuses on profitability and higher- margin categories. TikTok Shop and Tokopedia -- which integrated with TikTok Shop in Indonesia -- have a combined share of 28%, making it Shopee's biggest challenger in 2026.

Specifically on the sequential moderation quarter-over-quarter, management noted 3Q’s revenue guidance reflects: (i) more modest revenue growth in North America (vs. 2Q’s +9% growth) as management expects the benefit from value channel clearance actions in wholesale to abate in 2H (vs. 2Q) & as NKE begins to cycle more aggressive liquidation actions taken last year (i.e. factory store clearance) and (ii) “similar” declines anticipated in Greater China (vs. 2Q -16% c/c) and Converse (-31% c/c) as NKE continues to reset the marketplace across each segment to return to a more profitable and sustainable foundation for revenue growth moving forward. This remains consistent with NKE’s prior 9/30 EPS Call commentary “we expect revenue and gross margin headwinds from Greater China and Converse to continue throughout fiscal '26”. (3) Breaking Down the 3Q Gross Margin Outlook: Driving the magnitude of 3Q’s gross margin decline of down -175-225bps Y/Y (Street +40bps), mgmt cited a - 315bps gross headwind to product costs associated with tariffs, partially offset by “the beginning of recovery of transitory headwinds at the corporate level” such as improved full- price selling mix in North America on increase demand for full price led by continued newness and product innovation, fewer days of promotion, and lower markdown rates, in addition to tariff mitigation strategies. Further, management reiterated ongoing “Win Now” actions to reset the marketplace for Greater China and Converse (consistent with previously stated expectations on the 9/30 EPS Call “we expect revenue and gross margin headwinds from Greater China and Converse to continue throughout fiscal '26” and with our 11/17 Recent Fieldwork & Management Access Takes). Putting the pieces together, mgmt’s outlook calls for 3Q’s gross margins to decline 75bps Y/Y at the high-end (excluding a net tariff headwind of ~100bps), which compares to 2Q’s underlying gross margin decline of 125bps Y/Y (ex. a net tariff headwind of 175bps) and 1Q’s -220bps underlying decline, representing sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter as NKE begins to realize initial full price realization benefits from improved inventory health/ composition. Model Implications: We model FY26 EPS of $1.48 (raised versus $1.42 prior) based on revenues down +0.8% Y/Y on a reported basis, or -0.9% constant-currency and 6.0% operating margins. On FY27, we model EPS of $2.14 prudently based on +3.6% revenue CT Oh L is U d Mo c Bu I Am .e n t is b e in g p r o v id e d f o r t h e e x c lu s iv e u s e o f S I M O N K U R O N O a t U N I V E R S I T Y O F B R I T I S H Matthew R.

Remain Overweight with our $86 Dec ’26 price target unchanged & based on NKE’s 1.8x pre-pandemic PEG on high-teens growth profile (& high 20’s pre-pandemic multiple on 10% Op Margin math). Key Print Takeaways: • 2Q Revenue Outperformance vs. Street Led By N. America: NKE reported 2Q revenues +1.0% Y/Y (> Street -1% Y/Y) comprised of Direct sales -9% c/c (decelerating vs. 1Q’s -5% c/c), including Digital -14% Y/Y (vs. 1Q -12% Y/Y), and wholesale +8% c/c (& sequentially accelerating +300bps vs 1Q’s +5% c/c). Management continued to remain encouraged by the progress made in rebalancing Sportswear and Performance with running (>20% Y/Y in 2Q = 1Q) alongside Basketball and Training, while the Classics franchise continues to be rightsized (on track to decline $4B from peak levels by FY25-end). Digging deeper from a regional perspective (i) Greater China revenues -16% c/c (sequentially decelerating relative to 1Q’s -10% c/c decline) with Nike Direct down -18% (vs. 1Q -12% c/c) and wholesale down -15% Y/Y (1Q’s -9% c/c) with the region continued to be challenged by declining store traffic, soft seasonal sell-through rates and higher levels of aged inventory across the marketplace, (ii) North America revenues +9% Y/Y c/c (1Q +4% c/c) with Nike Direct down -10% on Digital -16% Y/Y and Stores +2% Y/Y while Wholesale sequentially accelerated to +24% (relative to 1Q’s +11%) with newness continuing to gain scale across the marketplace, (iii) EMEA revenues sequentially moderated to decline -1% c/c (1Q +1% c/c) with Nike Direct down -3% (comprised of Digital down -2% and Nike Stores -5%) and wholesale Flat (accelerating vs. 1Q’s -4%) and (iv) APLA revenues -4% c/c (vs. 1Q +1% c/c) due to Wholesale decelerating to -3% Y/Y (vs. 1Q’s +6% Y/Y) and Nike Direct -5% (> 1Q’s -6%) with Digital down -10% and Stores +1%. • 2Q26 Operating Margin Beat on SG&A Rate Favorability: On margins, 2Q EBIT margin declined -311bps to 8.1% (above Street 5.7%) with the beat primarily driven by (i) better-than-expected SG&A rate of 32.5% (Street 34.9%), with SG&A $’s +0.8% Y/Y, including operating overhead expenses declining -4.1% Y/Y on disciplined cost management, while demand creation dollars grew +13.5% Y/Y reflecting an increase in brand & sports marketing expense, in addition to (ii) 2Q GPM -302bps Y/Y (= Street -300bps) to 40.6% was a result of increased product costs due to N/A tariffs and incremental inventory obsolescence in Greater China. • Balance Sheet Snapshot: NKE ended 2Q w/ $8.3B of cash and equivalents & short-term investments against $8.0B in long-term debt. On shareholder returns, NKE paid total dividends of $598M. Turning to inventories which exited the quarter -3% Y/Y representing a 400bps spread relative to +1% reported revenue growth Y/Y (vs. 1Q’s 300bps spread) was a result of decreased units partially offset by increased product costs from North American tariffs. Specifically, CEO Friend cited “In North America and EMEA, which represent almost three-quarters of our business, we have returned to a healthy marketplace, and continue to have work to do in Greater China, parts of ALPA and Converse.” Digging deeper on the marketplace by region, management noted EMEA remains the cleanest region, followed by meaningful progress in North America, while further work is required to reset the marketplace in Greater China (despite having taken “aggressive actions” to clean the marketplace through 4Q & 1Q) alongside APLA where management noted the region remains dispersed with pockets of elevated inventory requiring a higher level of promotional activity.

(Overweight; Price Target: $86.00) Investment Thesis NKE is the global athletic market leader with diversification across product categories, geographies, and distribution, and we see the model at an inflection for revenue growth to re-accelerate into 2H26/FY27 following several quarters of franchise product lifecycle management & inventory liquidation headwinds. Further, we see opportunity for NKE to recapture over 500bps of operating margin erosion on improved full-price selling & reception to new product innovation and as NKE begins to leverage on SG&A expenses with an inflection to topline growth. Valuation Our Dec ’26 Price Target of $86 is unchanged & based on ~33x our revised CY27 EPS of $2.56 (= NKE’s 1.8x pre-pandemic PEG on high-teens growth profile). Risks to Rating and Price Target The economic climate, particularly the employment picture, can affect consumer spending and the sportswear industry. A greater-than-expected downturn in household spending could cause sales trends to decelerate below our current assumptions rendering our estimates too high. Roughly 50% of the company’s revenues are generated outside of the United States, w/ downside risk to our price target if the USD strengthens further. With the company’s exposure to manufacturing in Southeast Asia, trade policy changes notably in Vietnam could render our estimates too high should NKE not be able to mitigate against tariff related costs.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. Some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe of the relevant duration of the region. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe.

However, turns take time to execute, Shares Outstanding (mn) 1478.20 and NKE's FY2Q26 results showed a ""two steps forward (in NA), one step back (in China and Free Float (%) 98.68 APLA)"" pattern.

Price Performance Exchange-NYSE 52 Week range USD 82.44-52.28 FY2Q26 beat embedded mixed results; FY3Q26 lowered guidance due to China. NKE's FY2Q26 results were mixed and though we are encouraged by the results within NA with +9% top-line growth driven by wholesale +24%, GC remains a drag as direct was down -18% and wholesale was down -15%. Additionally, GM was down -300bps, which remains pressured by increased product costs as a result of tariffs as well as its steps to finalize the liquidation of its classic inventory that had been returned to NKE from the marketplace. However, on the positive side, the company cited positivity around running, new innovation, and products within the channel, which could lead to margin expansion and acceleration on the top-line. Entering Source: IDC Link to Barclays Live for interactive charting FY2H26, we expect margins before sales – with sequential improvement on margins outpacing sales growth.

In reaction in the aftermarket, NKE shares traded -10.6% versus S&P 500 flat. Reiterate EW as we see NKE range-bound as a ""prove it to me"" story for CY26. Thus far and in our view, Mr. Hill's vision highlights three key priorities: 1) product, 2) marketing, and 3) marketplace, which are expected to drive Nike's return to profitable and healthy growth. Mr. Hill is expediting innovation through the company's express lane and pulling forward as much commercial-ready product as possible, while the product launches are being supported with Nike-branded demand creation. We certainly believe that redirecting Nike’s large asset base and budget will ultimately lead to market share recovery and top-line growth. However, in the near term, the reset actions will likely take a toll on profit margins and sales growth throughout FY26, as NKE's issues are not short-horizon fixes. Tariff Exposure Update. In 2Q26, NA GM declined 330bps, including a 520bps impact from tariffs. 3Q26 GM is expected to decline 175bps to 225bps, which includes a 315bps headwind due to higher product costs from tariffs. FY26 net tariff headwind after mitigation efforts of 120bps, equal to $1.5B in annualized incremental gross product costs, remains unchanged from the prior quarter's guidance. Quarter in review. NKE reported FY2Q26 EPS of $0.53 (vs. consensus/Barclays of $0.38/$0.42), as its SG&A rate materially beat at 32.5% of sales (vs. cons. 34.8%) due to operating overhead savings and a top-line beat. GM of 40.6% matched consensus, which was at the higher end of the company's prior GM expectation range of down 300bps to down 375bps. Revenue of $12.43bn beat consensus of $12.24bn, driven by Nike brand footwear sales of $7.66bn (vs. cons. $7.56bn) and Nike brand apparel sales of $3.91bn (vs. cons. $3.75bn), partially offset by Nike brand equipment sales of $550mn (vs. cons. $554mn). By region, revenue upside was driven by North America (+9.0% y/y ex-FX vs. cons. -0.4%), while EMEA matched consensus (-1.0% y/y ex- FX), partially offset by Greater China (-16.0% y/y ex-FX vs. cons. -9.3%) and APLA (-4.0% y/y ex-FX vs. cons. -0.8%). The company provided guidance for FY3Q26, calling for sales to be down LSD (vs. cons. +1.5%), GM to decline -175bps to -225bps (vs. cons. +60bps), which includes ~315bps of negative tariff impact, and SG&A dollars to be up +LSD (vs. cons. +1.6%). Inventory. Based on our proprietary inventory analysis, NKE has posted two consecutive quarters of positive sales-to-inventory growth. In FY2Q26 the Inventory Management Spread (""IM Spread"") was 302 basis points and improved from 220 basis points in the prior quarter. NKE's Gross Margin Return on Inventory (""GMROI"") has worsened for six consecutive quarters, and its Operating Margin Return on Inventory (""OMROI"") has worsened for six consecutive quarters. Lowering our below-consensus estimates and PT to $64 (from $70). Our FY26, FY27, and FY28 adj. EPS estimates are $1.47, $2.25, and $2.76, respectively, (down from $1.52, $2.30, and $2.81) driven by lower GM and slightly lower sales, partially offset by SG&A leverage. Our PT of $64 (from $70) is based on 25x (was 27x) applied to our CY27 EPS estimate of $2.54 (from $2.59). We lower our multiple two turns as we believe a sustained profitable top-line recovery will take longer to evolve and FY27 and FY28 consensus margin expansion may prove too aggressive. 18 December 2025 2 Barclays | Nike, Inc.

Proprietary PRISM Curve: NKE Fundamentals Are Bottoming From a fundamental perspective, we attempt to use our proprietary PRISM cycle as a leading indicator of a potential sales inflection (i.e., either from positive to negative or negative to positive). Our PRISM Curve attempts to look for fundamental changes in the business model of a company, driven by proactive management decisions to stabilize margins (e.g., purge inventory, cut costs, share best practices, invest in product and brand). Figure 1 and Figure 2 below depict our model graphically and identify where we would theoretically expect to see sales and margin changes along the business model curve. The TRAP Phase While there are four distinct phases of our PRISM Curve as per the graphics below, we believe NKE is in the latter stage of the “TRAP” phase, where fundamentals are deteriorating as competition in all categories remains stiff and pricing power is fleeting for its core franchises. As market share erodes, the lack of sales is causing operating deleverage. During the TRAP phase, management’s strategy is on the defensive – meaning actions are being taken to change business trends, but the issues have not yet stabilized. The ESCAPE Phase We look for evidence that NKE will transition into the ESCAPE phase in FY2H26 in which issues have been identified and are being proactively corrected. At some point, a company’s management makes the changes necessary to correct problems at the business, and the company passes the negative-to-positive inflection point. During the ESCAPE phase, management’s strategy is on the offense. They are actively taking measures to stem losses and stabilize market share. They are focused on driving full-price, healthy sales and likely will have ratcheted back inventory; they are less focused on their competitors’ actions or the environment around them. Typically, a company will move past this point by driving comps with better merchandising and improved inventory management (growing inventory below sales plan). At this point, a company is not yet showing direct signs that fundamentals are currently improving; instead, it is showing signs that fundamentals are stabilizing and are becoming “less bad.” Management is willing to make difficult strategic decisions, and fundamentals are likely to begin improving in the near future. As the company moves further to the right, it is continuing to comp negatively, but less so, and begins to show marginal signs of improvement. During the ESCAPE phase, we typically see a margin recovery before we see a return to sustainable positive sales growth. FIGURE 1.

Tariff Exposure Update. In 2Q26, NA GM declined 330bps, including a 520bps impact from tariffs. 3Q26 GM is expected to decline 175bps to 225bps, which includes a 315bps headwind due to higher product costs from tariffs. FY26 net tariff headwind after mitigation efforts of 120bps, equal to $1.5B in annualized incremental gross product costs, remains unchanged from the prior quarter's guidance. Prior Tariff Commentary. Based on reciprocal tariff rates as of NKE's FY1Q26 call on 9/30/25, NKE raised its expected impact from tariffs on an annualized gross incremental cost basis to approx. $1.5bn (up from $1.0bn). The company expected the net headwind to GM to increase to 120bps (from 75bps) for FY26, with a 175bps impact to FY2Q26. The company continues to expect to mitigate these new costs over time. Barclays Tariff ""QuikCalc"" Model assumptions. We provide our Tariff ""QuikCalc"" model analysis, which now assumes global tariff assumptions effective 8/7/25, resulting in an incremental ~$500m in gross tariff impact to FY26. Our prior tariff analysis assumed 30% China and 10% Rest of World (excluding Mexico and Canada). Note our estimate of Tariff on Goods Imported to the US is a gross unmitigated amount for a full year, and we calculate the price increase necessary to mitigate full tariff cost (absent other mitigation strategies). Our updated tariff calculator under 8/7/25 effective rates suggests that for NKE total average unit cost will increase by 8.3% with pass-through to the US market only increasing prices by 7.9% (see Figure 3). 18 December 2025 8 Barclays | Nike, Inc.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251226_Barclays_NKE_Nike-_Inc.-_FY2Q26_Review-_NA_Progress_Offset_by_Greater.pdf

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage universe""). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"": U.S. Specialty Retail, Apparel & Footwear Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.

King of the Hill. Just over one year ago NKE named their next leader—a 30+ year NKE veteran,",6,3,3,"Elliot Hill returns to the company and has played out several initiatives where he'd like to focus. One of the first things CEO Hill spoke about in this regard is the culture. While this is a fairly broad statement, Hill elaborated on his view that ""culture"" is about several key dynamics that need to be in place in order to drive the Nike brand—putting sport back at the center of everything they do, taking insights from their athletes and turning that into great product and improving storytelling behind their consumer led marketplace (with Direct and Wholesale working together). Elaborating further, over the years NKE had shifted to a mentality of a tech company vs. sports company. Too much reliance on data and analytics, which was a mistake. This led to poor decision-making and created the current marketplace issues that exist today. ""We’ve been in this situation before and will work our way through it over time."" Certainly not pleased with their financial performance over the past few years, Hill has stated that the strategy was off, execution was off and while the organization did put a number of actions into place 12+ months, he believes there remains several areas where they simply need to move faster.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251226_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_America-s_Great_Again...China_Not_So_Much-_Numbers.pdf

More on Recent Initiatives. 1) NKE (and Hill) is reigniting their culture by leading with sports,7,3,3,"(with more athlete and team collaborations) and inviting more consumers into the sport world — while putting athletes at the center of decisions again (pivoting away from lifestyle). Notably, they are shifting back towards having the mentality of a sports company (and away from a tech company) with a greater focus on art vs. science. 2) Shifting into sport-led teams (which move at a faster pace) to accelerate a complete product portfolio across 10 different sports spanning footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories (and analyzing how growth in each separate category rolls up to the total company) — with opportunities not only from product innovation but also merchandising. 3) Shifting investments back towards creating demand for brands (with demand creation close to 10% of revenue) by creating strong marketing stories and emotionally connecting with consumers during important sports moments and product launches—with the teams currently building anticipation for new launches and shifting spend from performance marketing to brand marketing. 4) Building back an integrated marketplace (wholesale), after it was de-prioritized due to a focus on digital revenue, and managing inventory across the marketplace by liquidating aged inventory to create space to sell new assortments and innovation coming in Fall and Holiday 2025. 5) Investing in specialty channels, including running and football (soccer)—and engaging with wholesale partners to build out a pipeline off innovative products across all sports and price points, while reducing weeks of supply to increase full-price selling.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251226_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_America-s_Great_Again...China_Not_So_Much-_Numbers.pdf

China Remains a Headwind. After several years of very strong growth China slowed materially,8,3,3,"post-COVID on a number of issues. Local companies like Anta (Salomon also gets a tailwind from its Anta association) and Li Ning have raised their own game in terms of sneaker technology, are able to price well below Nike—and have benefited from a cultural shift to China-centric companies. At the same time newer competitors like On and Hoka have also captured share in China on the rise of trail and road running, at the expense of basketball. These companies' focus on sport/technology has led to lifestyle success as well—mirroring broader trends in athletic participation. While we had previously expected the sales headwind to persist through summer 2026 (FY27), with any improvement in profitability driven more by margin normalization rather than a return to growth, 2Q results obscure this timeline. That said, recapture potential is significant—with operating margins down (1,500)bps over the last four years and (725+)bps over the last two.",nlp\raw_data\bloomberg\nke_research\20251226_Wells_Fargo_NKE_NKE-_America-s_Great_Again...China_Not_So_Much-_Numbers.pdf

Financial Headwinds Could Start to Slow in 2H26. While not out of the woods yet (we forecast,9,3,5,"an additional $1.5B of clearance through 1Q27) we do believe the rate of change slows for NKE after 2Q26 ($800M of the remaining $1.5B). Further, we do see greenshoots in footwear ex- Classics and NKE's ""Rest of Business"" - each of which improved sequentially in NA through 2Q26. However, we see GM recapture as the key near-term driver. NKE has absorbed a significant amount of cost, in multiple ways, cleaning up Classics footwear (we estimate $6B total revenue headwind). These include impacts to 1) channel mix and margin rates within channels— incremental sell-in to closeout, 2) ASP driven declines in Nike Direct—both stores and online, 3) through inventory and sales reserves and inventory obsolescence charges, and on 4) fixed costs. The Bull vs. Bear ""Tug of War"" Equity Research | 3 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research Below, we illustrate how we think the buyside is positioning its thesis—detailing the current Bull and Bear arguments on NKE shares. Exhibit 1 - The Bull vs Bear ""Tug of War"" The Bull Case…. We believe that investors who are bullish on NKE shares are focused on: (1) favorable risk-reward at current levels—NKE remains one the strongest softlines brands in the space that, while experiencing some transitory challenges, still has the key long-term opportunities intact; (2) ""new"" CEO Elliot Hill is aggressively cleaning inventory and removing stale product from the market, (3) numbers have been reset and sentiment remains low; and (4) with marketplace inventories eventually clean NKE can refocus on growth, now driven internally through sport—which allows for focused innovation, marketing and community connection. The Bear Case…. On the other hand, investors who are bearish on NKE shares are likely focused on: (1) NT outlook to remain choppy—global demand very different across geographies and each on separate timelines; (2) China is structurally challenged with headwinds persisting longer than expected; (3) NT issues exacerbated by strong competitors such as ON and HOKA in the US and local brands in China (along with recent strength by Salomon and Arc'Teryx; and (4) global sport and fitness has transitioned more towards trail running and outdoor sport relative to ""indoor"" sports where NKE has historically found success. Financial Outlook FY26E: Our FY26E EPS estimate is $1.40 (lowered) representing EPS -35.2%. We're projecting total sales flattish. We are projecting gross margin down ~200bps, to 40.8%, and we expect SG&A to grow +0.5% in dollars, to ~35%. As a result, we expect operating margin to contract ~270bps, to 5.5%. FY27E: We forecast FY27 EPS of $2.00 representing EPS +42.8%. We're projecting total sales +2.8% and gross margin up ~130bps to 42.1%. We expect SGA to grow +1.7% in dollars but see (39)bps of leverage to 34.5%. As a result we forecast operating margin to expand +178bps to 7.2%. 4 | Equity Research NIKE, Inc.

(NKE) Investment Thesis We rate NKE Overweight. We believe a few things are happening: 1) Visibility is improving into NKE's revamped strategies (numbers are bottoming), 2) Material green shoots are appearing (innovation) and 3) Significant headwinds from ""Classics"" clean up should start to dissipate in the coming quarters. We can finally begin to map out realistic ""return to growth"" forecasts, while sizable margin levers likewise take hold. Target Price Valuation for NKE: $65.00 from $75.00 Our $65 price target is based on a ~32x P/E on our FY27E EPS. This is a slight premium to NKE's history, closer to a ""recovery"" multiple on trough earnings which we believe accurately reflects current headwinds vs. upside potential. We believe that ongoing opportunities for rev growth, margin expansion and FCF generation justify our target multiples, though we do see many near-term puts and takes around revenue/margin. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for NKE Downside risks: (1) new innovation (along w/ franchise reset) does not drive topline; (2) global demand remains tepid; and (3) the transition back to wholesale from DTC causes more material headwinds to profits in the NT. Upside risks include a positive turn in Chinese consumption trends and better than expected performance in US clearance activity on both sales and margins.

(SELL) Equity Research | 7 Retailing, Specialty Softlines, and E-commerce Equity Research Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department (“WFS Research”) personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (""Wells Fargo Securities""). WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
