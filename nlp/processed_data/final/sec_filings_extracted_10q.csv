 FIN 48 beginning February 1, 2007. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
 generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
 affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
 the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
 revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
 areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the
 determination of inventory valuation, depreciation and
 amortization, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and
 recognition of breakage on gift cards. Actual amounts could
 differ materially from those estimates. Inventories, consisting of finished goods, raw materials and
 work in process, are stated at the lower of cost and market
 value. Cost is determined using standard costs, which

If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet guest expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be harmed.

Under this model, entities are required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.

Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending on discretionary items include general economic conditions (particularly those in North America), high levels of unemployment, health pandemics (such as the impact of the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, tax rates and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. To date, COVID-19 and related precautions and mitigation measures have negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While the duration and severity of the economic impact of COVID-19 is unknown, any recession, depression or general downturn in the global economy will negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future.

revenues improved significantly relative to a year ago. While our total
closeout sales were about the same as last year, the margins generated on those
sales were greatly improved primarily as a result of the significant inventory
liquidation efforts in place around the world last year. This quarter was the
first in over a year that reflected the total margin impact of those efforts. In addition, virtually all of our revenue increases for the quarter were from
in-line product sales that carried higher margins. The increase in margins can
also be attributed to the leveraging of fixed warehousing and distribution costs
over increasing revenue volumes, and increased comparative pricing margins on
both in-line and closeout product sales. Management believes that significant funds generated by operations,
together with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs. Significant short and long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks,
which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity. Liquidity

 nine-month period in fiscal 1999, which generated an increase in cash
 flows from operations in that fiscal year. The current fiscal year began
 with much lower, cleaner levels of inventory; therefore, there was no
 cash inflow from decreasing inventory levels during the year. The
 decrease in inventory levels in 1999 highlighted our successful
 initiative to reduce close-out inventories undertaken to significantly
 improve our margins and profitability in the short-term as well as into
 the future. 2) During fiscal year 1999 our business experienced a slow-down
 leading us to further decrease our inventory levels, whereas in fiscal
 year 2000 our business has been accelerating from last year's level. This difference has resulted in additional use of cash as compared to
 last year to fund increasing levels of operations. 3) Finally, we restructured our operating arrangement with NIAC in the first
 quarter of this year. The restructured agreement enables us, among other
 things, to take over financing of inventory purchases previously
 performed by NIAC. This has resulted in the recording of USA inventory
 on our balance sheet fifteen to twenty-five days earlier than in the
 past. Although the net working capital impact of this new arrangement is
 minimal, as of February 29, 2000, approximately $130 million of inventory
 was in-transit to the U.S. and on our balance sheet, compared to zero at

 May 31, 1999. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's
actions to better align its cost structure with expected revenue growth
rates. The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular format) primarily
related to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities company-wide, resulting
in costs to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease
abandonments related to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and
elimination of, certain job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters
in Hong Kong, resulting in reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and
other costs of downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the
Company's Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-down of assets no
longer in use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term
endorsement contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; and 5) the
decision to exit certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer subsidiary,
resulting in the reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the write-down of
assets no longer in use, and the estimated loss on divestiture of certain
manufacturing plants. Another significant driver of the increase in short-term debt was our
continued repurchases of NIKE stock under the $1 billion share repurchase
program approved by the company's board of directors in December 1997. During
the first nine months of fiscal 2000, we purchased a total of 10.6 million

cash for working capital. This change in working capital was due to a smaller
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the first quarter of

agreement with NIAC in fiscal year 2000. Interest expense for the quarter increased from $10.0 million last year

together with access to external sources of funds, will be adequate to meet
our anticipated capital needs. We maintain significant short and long-term
lines of credit with banks, which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate
operating liquidity. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper
program, under which there was $735.1 million outstanding at November 30,
2000. During the second quarter, we entered into a new $1.25 billion committed
credit facility with a group of banks: $750.0 million has a maturity of 364
days from the borrowing date and $500.0 million has a maturity of five years
from the borrowing date. To date, we have not borrowed against the facility. Each year both facilities can be extended for an additional year. Our
long-term debt rating is now A2 and A by Moody's Investor Service and
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Second quarter interest expense increased by $10.0 million versus last
year, to $16.7 million. Fiscal year-to-date interest expense increased $15.4
million versus last year, to $32.1 million. The increases in current quarter
and year-to-date interest costs were due to higher average levels of debt in
the first half of fiscal 2001 versus the prior year. The Company increased
debt during the second half of fiscal 2000, primarily to fund capital
expenditures, repurchase stock, and finance inventory previously financed by
our trading partner, Nissho Iwai American Corporation.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-01-000002.txt

Capital Resources discussion following for more information on debt balances. The gross margin percentage for the second quarter was 39.6% compared to
39.9% in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. The primary driver of
this reduction was foreign exchange rates. Our international revenues are
primarily denominated in foreign currencies whereas a substantial portion of
our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge most significant
foreign exchange exposures through foreign exchange contracts, but the entire
impact of foreign exchange rates, positive or negative, may not immediately
affect the prices we charge customers. For the second quarter, foreign exchange
rates adversely affected results in the EMEA region; however this was partially
offset by positive exchange rate effects in the Asia Pacific and Americas
regions. Cash provided by operations for the six-month period ended November 30,
2000 was $306.0 million, which was a decrease of $260.1 million from the same
period last year, despite increased net income of $21.8 million in the current
period. The decrease in operating cash flow occurred due to variances in our
working capital. During the six-month period ended November 30, 2000 other
working capital components increased $128.9 million whereas in the six-month
period ended November 30, 1999 other working capital components decreased by
$147.7 million.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-01-000002.txt

million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $33 million. These purchases
were made under a four-year, $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by
our Board of Directors at the beginning the current fiscal year. Funding for
repurchases has, and is expected to continue to come primarily from operating
cash flow. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by
working capital needs and stock market conditions. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2001 was $119.4 million,
an 11% increase over the $107.5 million reported in the second quarter of
fiscal year 2000. Fiscal year-to-date net income increased 7% to $329.6
million. The increase in net income for the second quarter was driven by a 7%
increase in revenues and by favorable other income/expense results. These
factors were partially offset by a 30 basis point reduction in gross margin
percentage, increased selling and administrative expenses and higher interest
expense. The 7% increase in year-to-date net income was driven by a 6% increase
in revenues, a 90 basis point improvement in gross margin percentage and
foreign exchange gains reported in other income/expense. These factors were
partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses, and higher

partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses, and higher
interest expense. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% in the quarter and
11% year-to-date. Due to share repurchases, fewer shares were outstanding at
the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2001 than at the end of the year-ago
quarter. As a result, earnings per share grew faster than net income. Selling and administrative expenses increased for both the quarter and
fiscal year-to-date period compared to the prior year. For the quarter, these
expenses were up 8% to $673.1 million, and year-to-date they were up 10% to
$1,374.2 million. The increases, for both the quarter and the year-to-date
period, were driven primarily by incremental spending for marketing and
operational initiatives undertaken to achieve future revenue growth and
profitability. Marketing initiatives focused on the 2000 Summer Olympics, the
2000 European Soccer Championships, and soccer investments in the Americas
region, where we have increased our on-field presence through additional club
and individual player sponsorships. Operational initiatives included
continued expansion of new retail outlets; the development of e-commerce;
investments in systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain;
and expansion of NIKE distribution to territories formerly served by
independent distributors. Partially offsetting these increases was a
reduction in bad debt expense. Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear
and apparel scheduled for delivery between December 2000 and April 2001

orders between years are not necessarily indicative of the change in revenues
that we will experience for subsequent periods. This is due to potential

 on close-outs, primarily in footwear. The higher mix of close-outs and
 lower close-out pricing margins were due in part to the supply chain
 disruptions discussed above, which resulted in excess inventory that we
 are currently liquidating. 2) Higher fixed design, production, and distribution costs per each unit
 sold, due to lower than expected revenues during the period. 3) The effect of the change in foreign exchange rates, most notably the
 weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. We believe that cash flow generated by operations, together with access
to external sources of funds, will be adequate to meet our anticipated capital
needs. We maintain significant short and long-term lines of credit with
banks, which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there
was $745.6 million outstanding at February 28, 2001. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2001, we purchased a total of 0.5
million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $19.5 million. These

adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002 on both our income

statement will primarily represent the acceleration of option premium cost
recognition as compared to current practice. FAS 133 requires that option
premium costs be expensed over the life of the option while our current
practice is to expense these costs over the period the underlying exposure
affects earnings. The transition adjustment on the balance sheet will
represent the initial recognition of the fair values of hedge derivatives
outstanding on the adoption date and any realized gains or losses on effective
hedges for which the underlying exposure has not yet affected earnings. We
expect to apply cash flow hedge accounting as permitted by FAS 133. Accordingly, the offset to recognizing the initial fair value of outstanding
hedge derivatives and realized hedge gains and losses will be recorded to
other comprehensive income. Current year third quarter interest expense of $14.0 million was

strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges to either
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm

both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives

changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be
expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined
that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge,
the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge the risks described above are
forward exchange contracts, net purchased options and cross-currency swaps. These instruments protect against the risk that the eventual net cash inflows
and outflows from foreign currency denominated transactions will be adversely
affected by changes in exchange rates. The cross-currency swaps are used to
hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan
agreements. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in European
currencies, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Korean won. The Company hedges up to 100% of anticipated exposures as much as 24 months in

expected duration, which in some circumstances may be in excess of five years. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-
performance by counterparties to hedging instruments and does not enter into
master netting arrangements. The counterparties to derivative transactions are
major financial institutions with high investment grade credit ratings and,
additionally, counterparties to derivatives three years or greater are AA or
better rated. However, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to
credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to
the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail
to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established
counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to
senior management according to prescribed guidelines. The Company utilizes a
portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the
same countries the Company conducts its business. As a result of the above
considerations, the Company considers the risk of counterparty default to be
minimal. Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial

costs that are not allocated to the operating segments for management
reporting and intercompany eliminations for specific income statement items. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer
probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected
period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other
comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period
or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and
losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized
immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is
discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry

September 11, 2001 negatively affected U.S. NIKE brand revenues in the second
quarter, particularly at NIKE-owned retail stores and wholesale sales of
equipment. (Our apparel and footwear wholesale businesses were not affected
as severely because a large portion of their second quarter revenues derived
from orders placed several months in advance, prior to the September 11
attacks.) In addition, revenues from our Cole Haan business were also
negatively affected, most significantly at company-owned retail stores. Although significant uncertainty continues to exist with respect to the future
prospects for the U.S. and world economies, we continue to expect earnings
growth for the full fiscal year. Revenues in the U.S. region were up 2.5% in the second quarter of fiscal
2002. Growth in the U.S. apparel and equipment businesses drove the revenue
increase for the region. U.S. apparel revenues increased 9.9% in the second
quarter, as increased demand for NIKE brand apparel more than offset declines
in licensed apparel sales due to the expiration of our agreement with the
National Football League. Close-out sales of apparel increased during the
quarter due to our decision to manage apparel inventory levels more
aggressively, improving storage efficiency in our warehouses and minimizing
the amount of inventory converted into the new supply chain systems
implemented in December. U.S. equipment revenues grew 14.3% in the second
quarter, driven by growth in sales of golf products as well as bags, socks,

reflected early shipments of footwear, apparel, and equipment products prior
to our warehouse shutdown in November, due to the implementation of new U.S. supply chain systems at the beginning of December. In the Americas region, reported revenues were up 4.5% in the second
quarter, which represented 12.9% growth in constant dollars. Current
uncertain economic conditions in Argentina may negatively affect revenues in
this region during the remainder of the fiscal year, although we do not expect
that the negative effect will be significant to our consolidated operating
results. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2002 was $129.3 million, an
8.3% increase compared to net income reported in the second quarter of fiscal
2001. The increase in net income for the quarter reflected a 5.8% increase in
pre-tax income. The increase in quarterly pre-tax income was driven by a 6.3%
increase in revenues, from $2,198.7 million to $2,336.8 million, as well as
lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues and lower
interest expense. A decrease in our gross margin percentage from 39.6% to
38.3% and higher other expense partially offset these improvements to pre-tax
income. In the Asia Pacific region, quarterly reported revenues increased 11.2%

region, quarterly reported revenues increased 13.8%, or 10.6% in constant

increase in the quarter, drove the result. This increase was due to higher
prices and higher unit sales, as well as a higher-priced product mix as
compared to the second quarter of last year. Consolidated revenues increased 2.4% for the year-to-date period. Had
foreign exchange rates remained constant, the increase in revenues for the

of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the
excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market
value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense. We estimate
future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future
operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ
from actual cash flows due to, among other things, technological changes,
economic conditions, or changes to our business operations. We have

accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect
working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue
recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory
reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies
require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements

actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six

returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at
the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of
product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims
and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. In the past, actual
returns and claims have not exceeded our reserves. However, actual returns
and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ
from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were
significantly greater than the reserves we had established, we would record a
reduction to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Pretax income for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 increased 27.5% versus
the third quarter of fiscal 2001, driven by a 4.2% increase in revenues (from

separate business. Certain NIKE Golf inventories, receivables, and property,
plant, and equipment continue to be managed by the regions, and as a result,
no reclassifications for these balances have been made. NIKE Golf information
for the applicable prior year period has been reclassified to conform to the

fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash
flow analyses and comparisons with the market values of similar publicly-
traded companies. The remaining $87.6 million of the impairment charge relates to
trademarks associated with Bauer. Under FAS 142, impairment of an indefinite-
lived asset exists if the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of trademarks using the relief-from-

significantly below prior year levels. This is a result of both lower orders
from Foot Locker and limitations we have imposed on this customer's purchase
of certain products. Although we do not yet have visibility to orders beyond
February 2003, we believe this trend will likely continue until we begin to
compare our results to lower prior year Foot Locker orders beginning in the
second quarter of fiscal 2004. We are continuing to work with Foot Locker to
develop a plan for our business together that enables both companies to
achieve their strategic objectives. At the same time, we are also pursuing
incremental sales with other retailers to offset the decline in revenues from
Foot Locker. Although we do not expect to fully offset the revenue loss from
Foot Locker in the short term, we believe we will ultimately succeed in
realigning distribution of our products in the U.S. to meet consumer demand
and generate profitable revenue growth. We are currently experiencing some delays in delivering retailer orders
for footwear and apparel product in the U.S. These delivery issues are the
result of the recent closure of West Coast ports and apparel sourcing issues

subsequent transportation backlog will create additional delivery delays and
increase our airfreight costs. These delivery delays may affect the timing of
revenues, or if more prolonged, may result in order cancellations. However,
at this time we are unable to fully assess the impact of these factors on our
future financial results. Since the labor issues leading to the port closures
have not yet been resolved, it is unclear when the current backlog will be
eliminated and the ports will return to normal operation. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, our quarterly gross margin
percentage improved 200 basis points as compared to the prior year period,
from 39.4% to 41.4%, our largest quarterly gross margin percentage in recent
history. Each of our regional businesses achieved a higher margin percentage
this quarter than this same quarter last year. On a global basis,

margin percentage resulted in part from a higher mix of sales of classic
footwear models which are generally more profitable than our more complex
performance models. The share repurchases were part of a $1 billion share repurchase program
that began in fiscal 2001. In the current quarter, we purchased approximately
947,000 shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $44.5 million. We expect to
fund this program from operating free cash flow. The timing and the amount of
shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market
conditions. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues
from 26.6% to 28.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 versus the first
quarter of fiscal 2002. Demand creation expense was $322.2 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to $257.1 million in fiscal 2002. The primary driver of this increase was spending in fiscal 2003 for our World
Cup 2002 marketing campaign, which occurred primarily in our international
regions. This increase also reflected the relatively low amount of spending
in the first quarter of last year as we limited demand creation spending in
order to focus spending on the World Cup campaign, which began late in fiscal
2002. Operating overhead increased 8.6% between the first quarter of fiscal

account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve
for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent
payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make
estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related

property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future
undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or
not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate
of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the
excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market
value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense. We estimate
future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future
operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in
future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic
conditions, or changes to our business operations. Such changes may result in
impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel

businesses in revenue growth in the second quarter and first six months of

apparel, and equipment and reflected strong demand for NIKE brand products
across the entire region. The emerging markets in central and eastern Europe
provided significant revenue growth to the region. EMEA's second quarter
growth also reflected the acceleration of a significant amount of third
quarter revenues into the second quarter due to our December supply chain
system implementation. Consistent with our approach to the systems
implementation in the U.S. last year, we closed our European distribution
center from November 27, 2002 to December 6, 2002 to prepare for the new
system implementation. Prior to the shut down period, we accelerated futures
orders and deliveries from December to October and November. In addition, we
aggressively liquidated closeout inventory prior to the shutdown. We estimate
that these operational adjustments moved approximately $66 million of reported
revenue from the third quarter to the second quarter, adding approximately 11
points to the second quarter constant dollar revenue growth and 5 points to
the year-to-date constant dollar growth for the region. U.S. region revenues decreased 8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2003

of deliveries from the third quarter to the second quarter in advance of the
U.S. supply chain system implementation in December 2001 reduced second
quarter revenue growth by approximately 4 points and year-to-date revenue
growth by approximately 2 points. The U.S. region also experienced footwear
and apparel delivery delays in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 due to the
labor dispute in the west coast ports and apparel sourcing issues related to
production scheduling and factory deliveries. We estimate these delays
reduced second quarter revenue growth by approximately 2 points and year-to-
date revenue growth by approximately 1 point. The second quarter and year-to-
date decreases in U.S region revenues also reflected a lower average price per
pair sold for our footwear in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002. This reduction
in average price reflected a shift in sales mix toward classic footwear and
kids models, due to the growing consumer demand for these products, which have
a lower price than our more complex adult performance models. Futures orders
for the second half of the year indicate that this trend will continue, at
least for the remainder of our fiscal year. Finally, our second quarter

second quarter demand creation expense was increased spending in the U.S., to
drive consumer demand as we realign our retail distribution. In addition, our
new endorsement agreement with the Manchester United soccer team became
effective in August 2002, driving higher demand creation spending in the EMEA

the year-over-year decline in U.S. footwear revenues. We expect U.S. sales to
Foot Locker to be below prior year levels at least through the first half of

limitations we have imposed on this customer's purchase of certain products. We are continuing to pursue incremental sales with other retailers in order to
offset the decline in revenues from Foot Locker. Although we do not expect to
fully offset the revenue loss from Foot Locker in the U.S. in the short term,

costs incurred in the EMEA region drove the growth in demand creation expense,

hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we

favorable translation of foreign-currency denominated profits. Therefore, the
net year-over-year effect of these hedge losses and favorable translation of
foreign currency-denominated profits is not material to our consolidated net
income for either the third quarter or the year-to-date period. We expect
these hedge losses will continue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and will

points of this reported increase were due to changes in currency exchange

five points of this growth can be attributed to an earlier start of the spring
season for footwear sales in Europe. As always, the reported futures orders
growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth

increase over the prior year is due to loss on disposal of land gifted to the
NIKE Foundation and legal settlement costs. The largest component of other
expense, net, comprising approximately half of this year's net expense, is
foreign currency losses primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges
to a European subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro. These losses
are comparable to last year and are reflected in the Corporate line in our
segment presentation of pre-tax income in Note 7 - Operating Segments. The
hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we
entered into these hedge contracts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, net foreign currency losses in other
expense, net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign
currency denominated profits, which resulted in higher translated earnings in
our foreign operations, most significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the net
impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a $34 million addition
to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year period. Consistent with our existing policies, we have also hedged a portion of
anticipated intercompany charges for the balance of fiscal 2004. As the euro
has strengthened since these hedge contracts were executed, we expect to

fiscal 2004 consolidated net income versus the prior year. Selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand creation and
operating overhead, grew 8% versus the prior year quarter, and as a percentage
of revenue, remained relatively consistent with the prior year. Demand
creation expense grew 1% to $324.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004
from $321.8 million in fiscal 2003, reflecting a six percentage point increase
due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of currency,
demand creation spending declined versus the first quarter of fiscal 2003
mainly due to costs of our World Cup marketing campaign incurred in the first
quarter of last year. Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific region increased to $76.7 million in
the first quarter of fiscal 2004 up from $50.7 million in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003. This increase reflected higher revenues, improved gross margins
and lower selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margins were
the result of higher in-line margins across footwear, apparel and equipment. Lower selling and administrative costs were driven mainly by a reduction in
demand creation spending compared to the expenses incurred in the prior year

 current product offerings, resulted from lower product costs due
 to manufacturing efficiencies, reduced material costs, and lower
 air freight as well as a higher mix of sales of classic footwear
 models. (2) A reduced level of closeout sales as a percentage of total sales
 and improved margins on those sales. (3) Changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro. EMEA pre-tax income grew 26% to $204.7 million in the first quarter of

the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative

attributable to the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases,

for just over half of the gross margin improvement, driven primarily by
foreign currency transaction benefits, partially offset by the impact of
higher inventories in Europe and Asia. Relatively low demand creation
(advertising and promotion) spending and favorable foreign currency
translation also added to our overall profitability in the second quarter. During the quarter, we also increased our return on invested capital and
increased the level of dividends as compared to the second quarter of fiscal
2004. Our year-to-date results continue to reflect the positive impact of the
Converse acquisition, although acquisitions did not have a material impact on
second quarter results. In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, net foreign
currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable
translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in

currency exchange rates did not have a net impact on the increase versus the

indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is
because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order
cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders

 gross margin percentage declines in our wholesale business. The
 wholesale gross margin percentage declined primarily due to higher
 discounts (again the result of increased sales to high volume
 accounts), and higher product costs and air freight incurred to meet
 strong footwear demand. For the nine-month period gross margins also
 benefited from fewer, more profitable closeout sales. In the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005, net foreign
currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable
translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in

costs. The improved gross margins contributed 10 basis points and 20 basis
of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage for the third quarter

margin percentage improvement was primarily the result of a higher
proportion of retail business within the total region revenues, partially
offset by lower in-line pricing margins for the wholesale business. For the

earnings per share of $1.01, a 36% increase versus the third quarter of fiscal
2004. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin percentage increased 200
basis points to 44.1%. The international regions accounted for approximately
two-thirds of the gross margin improvement, driven primarily by foreign
currency transaction benefits. This benefit was partially offset by strategies
to improve product value in Europe and Asia and the impact of increased levels
of closeout sales and lower closeout pricing margins in Europe, the result of
higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories. Favorable foreign currency
translation also added to our overall profitability in the third quarter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, pre-tax income for the Americas
Region increased 49% from the prior year quarter, to $23.2 million. Year-to-
date fiscal 2005 pre-tax income increased 24% to $88.4 million. The increase
in pre-tax income for the third quarter and year-to-date periods was
attributable to higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage,

reduced in-line pricing margins for footwear and apparel were due to
strategies to improve consumer value, higher product costs due in part to
higher oil prices, higher discounts and a shift in the mix of products sold
toward products with lower margins, as discussed above. Higher selling and
administrative costs in the second quarter were driven by increases in both
demand creation and operating overhead expenses. Demand creation spending
increased in the second quarter primarily due to increased advertising
spending, reflecting a shift in the timing of certain advertising campaigns
from the first quarter to the second quarter of fiscal 2006. For the six-

higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2005. This increase was reduced by 4.5 percentage points due to changes in

currency impact, higher average selling prices for footwear and apparel
contributed approximately 1 percentage point of the growth in overall

always, the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily
indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is
because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once

increased investment in our retail businesses and higher personnel costs. The year-to-date period was also affected by increased spending on global

in the average selling price per pair was due in part to changes in the mix

the difference in timing of major advertising campaigns during fiscal 2007

compensation and higher headcount due to retail growth. Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel,

timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital
needs and stock market conditions. In the Asia Pacific region, changes in currency exchange rates
contributed 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point of revenue growth for
the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively. The majority of
countries within the region reported double-digit sales increases for both the
quarter and year-to-date period. China continues to be the primary driver of
growth within the region, as revenues increased 20% for the quarter and 27%

both the number of stores selling Nike product and the sales through existing
doors. While revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was strong, revenue

first quarter of fiscal 2008 was largely due to an increase in accounts
receivable, which was a function of our year-over-year revenue growth, most
notably in our international regions. In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates
contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the first quarter of
fiscal 2008. While the majority of countries within the region reported
double-digit percentage sales increases versus the prior year's first quarter,
China continues to be the primary driver of growth, as revenues increased 50%
on a currency-neutral basis. The revenue growth in China was primarily due to
expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through
existing retail doors. Constant-currency revenue in Japan decreased 5% during
the first quarter of fiscal 2008 versus the comparable prior year period due
to year-over-year changes in the timing of shipments. Despite recent softness
in this market, we continue to see positive signs, as orders received for the

foreseeable future. In
the first six months of fiscal 2009, we purchased ­­­­­10.6
million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock for $639.0 million. As
of November 30, 2008, we have now repurchased 49.2 million shares for $2.7
billion under the $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June
2006. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share
repurchase program. The new program will commence upon completion of
our current $3 billion share repurchase program. We expect to fund share
repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and
the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock
market conditions. Worldwide futures and advance
orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery
from December 2008 through April 2009, were 1% lower than such orders reported
for the comparable period of fiscal 2008. This futures growth rate is
calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our

contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the futures decline versus the

increases for footwear were the primary growth driver in overall futures
and advance orders. For the second
quarter of fiscal 2009, the primary factors contributing to the increase in
gross margins versus the prior year period were improved year-on-year hedge
rates, most notably in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)
region, partially offset by higher warehousing costs, increased discounts
on in-line product, primarily apparel, and increased inventory
obsolescence reserves. For the year-to-date period, the increase in
gross margins was primarily the result of improved year-on-year hedge rates,
primarily in the EMEA region, and an improved sales mix of higher margin

warehousing costs in the U.S. Income

The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. As of November 30, 2013, all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Company’s fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement.

The Company’s derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties’ creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company’s bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of November 30, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had no derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position.

As previously disclosed, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2011 proposing an increase in tax of $31 million, subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. This notice also reported a decrease in foreign tax credit carryovers for fiscal 2010 and 2011. The Company has contested this deficiency notice by filing a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in April 2015. The Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on the financial statements. No payments on the assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved. Based on the information currently available, the Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months. The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company’s payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-16-000264.txt

Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of February 28, 2017, the Company had received $293 million of cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements). The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial.

The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

 Consolidated gross margins improved over the prior year, increasing 
from 38.4% in the prior year second quarter to 39.3% in the current year. The increase was a result of the high volume of revenues, along with 
strong demand for NIKE products combined with sound inventory management 
which resulted in a smaller percentage of lower margin closeout sales. The 
Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory management, 
minimizing foreign exchange risk, and production sourcing in order to 
maximize gross profit. Selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of
revenues from 27.7% during the prior year second quarter to 25.5% in the 
current year. On an absolute dollar basis, spending increased $45 million, 
or 20%, with all new NIKE-owned subsidiaries accounting for $29 million of 
the increase.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-95-000001.txt

or 20%, with all new NIKE-owned subsidiaries accounting for $29 million of 
the increase. International operations in total added $36 million, a 
result of the new subsidiaries and planned increases in international 
infrastructure development. Also, the foreign currency translation impact 
increased spending by approximately $4 million. U.S. operations were up 
$9 million, primarily in planned marketing expenses. The Company intends 
to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through of the high level 
of orders discussed below. As a result, the Company expects selling and 
administrative costs as a percentage of revenues for the current year to 
approximate the prior year results. Interest expenses for the quarter increased slightly over the prior 
year due to increased operational short-term borrowings related to the 
new NIKE subsidiaries mentioned previously, offset by lower U.S. borrowings. Other income decreased $2.8 million, primarily as a result of increased 
other expenses - including profit sharing, foreign currency 
transactions, asset disposals and goodwill - offset partially by 
increased interest income. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.0% compared 
to 37.43% in the prior year. Last year's second quarter included a reduction 
for the tax impact of permanently reinvesting foreign earnings overseas, 
as more fully discussed in that respective 10-Q. The Company 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1995 will approximate the 39.1% rate 
for the full fiscal year 1994.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-95-000001.txt

anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1995 will approximate the 39.1% rate 
for the full fiscal year 1994. Worldwide orders for athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for 
delivery from December 1994 through April 1995 were approximately $1.95 
billion, 34% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of 
the prior year. This represents a record amount of orders for any period, 
and will require a significant portion of our production capacity to be 
devoted to filling these orders, potentially impacting availability of 
product for ""at once"" shipments. These orders are not necessarily indicative 
of total revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of advance orders 
and ""at once"" shipments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and 
year to year. Additionally, as international operations continue to shift 
to a greater emphasis on futures orders, this mix again may vary. Finally, 
exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons. After a six-month ""Special 301"" investigation under the 1974 Trade 
Act, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (""USTR"") announced on 
December 31, 1994 that the United States will take retaliatory trade 
action against the People's Republic of China if China does not agree to 
address U.S. intellectual property rights concerns. On or before 
February 4, 1994 the USTR will make a final determination as to whether 
China's intellectual property right's enforcement policies and practices 
are unreasonable and constitute a burden on, or restrict, U.S. commerce.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-95-000001.txt

would target if sanctions were imposed, although the USTR may later 
reduce that list of targeted products. Seven categories of footwear are 
among the various products on the list. Targeted products would be 
assessed tariffs of 100 percent in addition to the current tariffs. A 
portion of the footwear that the Company imports from China into the 
U.S. falls into four of the seven potentially targeted categories of 
footwear, and sanctions would effectively eliminate imports from China 
in those categories. However, at the time of filing this report the 
Company anticipates that the sanctions, if imposed, would not have a 
material adverse effect on the Company due to the wide range of product 
sourcing available to the Company, and the lack of significance of the 
targeted categories to the Company's overall production. Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The Company's financial position remained strong, with working capital 
rising $86 million since May 31, 1994. The working capital ratio was 3.2:1 
at November 30, 1994 and at May 31, 1994. Cash and equivalents increased $27 million primarily as a result of 
cash flow from operations, offset partially by cash used by investing 
activities, including the purchase of a new NIKE-owned subsidiary, and 
cash used by financing activities, primarily the purchase of 1,000,000 
shares of NIKE stock under the stock repurchase program announced in

sales growth in both October and November over last May's comparable two 
month period. Overall inventories decreased $11 million since May 31. Gross U.S. footwear inventory is down $33 million and gross U.S. apparel inventory 
is down $4 million, however, international inventories have increased 
$25 million, primarily due to new NIKE-owned 
subsidiaries. During the quarter, the Company announced a 25% increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share from the previous $0.20 per 
share. Subsequent to November 30, 1994, the Company has commenced 
an offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Canstar Sports, 
Inc., the world's largest hockey equipment manufacturer for Canadian 
$27.50 per share in cash. The total value of the proposed transaction 
is approximately U.S.$395 million. The Company also announced that

Operating Results

 During the second quarter ended November 30, 1994, record revenues 
increased 31%, gross margins improved by .9% and selling and 
administrative expenses reduced as a percentage of sales, combining 
to increase net income by 62%, the first quarter to quarter 
comparison increase in six periods and the largest since May, 1990. Net income for the period was $84.9 million or $1.16 per share, 
compared to $52.3 million or $0.69 per share for the same period in the 
prior year. Earnings per share increased 68% as compared to the 62% 
increase in net income, primarily due to the Company's share repurchase 
program. In addition to being a record second quarter in earnings, the 
Company recognized several other milestones. This was the first second 
quarter with revenue in excess of $1 billion, the first time the Company's 
trailing twelve months'revenues have exceeded $4 billion, and the largest

strong contributor with growth of $115 million, or 34%, resulting from 
an increase of 39% in pairs shipped and a 4% decrease in average selling 
price. Revenues were strong across all categories, including an increase
in basketball which was the first comparative increase in 18 months. International revenues increased $106 million, or 32%, composed of 28% and 
41% increases in international footwear and apparel revenues, respectively. The international growth included a 22% increase from new 
NIKE-owned subsidiaries in Japan and Korea and a positive 5% affect from 
foreign exchange translation, partially offset by decreases in France and 
Germany which together combined for a 7% decrease in international's total

 Consolidated gross margins for the quarter were 39.7% compared to 
38.4% last year. The increase was a result of the high volume of revenues 
and a smaller percentage of closeout sales in the current year combined with 
lower margins in the prior year due to difficulties in other brands, 
including Sports Specialties and the decision to discontinue the i.e. division. The Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory 
management, minimizing foreign exchange risk, and production sourcing in 
order to maximize gross profit. Selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of
revenues from 26.5% during the prior year third quarter to 24.7% in the 
current year. On an absolute dollar basis, spending increased $47 million, 
or 20%, with new NIKE-owned subsidiaries accounting for $8 million of 
the increase. International operations added $24 million of spending, a 
result of the new subsidiaries and planned increases in international

$19 million, primarily in planned marketing expenses. The Company intends 
to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through of the high level 
of orders discussed below. As a result, the Company expects selling and 
administrative costs as a percentage of revenues for the current year to 
approximate the prior year results. Interest expenses for the quarter increased over the prior year due 
to both increased operational short-term borrowings at new NIKE subsidiaries 
and other international locations, and increased short-term borrowings 
in the U.S. primarily due to increased cash operational needs and the 
purchase of Canstar during the third quarter. Other income decreased 
$8.6 million mostly due to increases in profit share plan expense, foreign 
currency transactions, and goodwill along with shutdown expenses in 
connection with the continued consolidation of warehouse facilities in 
Europe. These increases were offset partially by increased interest income. In addition, a gain on insurance proceeds as a result of the flood at Tetra 
Plastics increased other income in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.0% compared 
to 38.4% in the prior year. Last year's third quarter included a reduction 
for the tax impact of permanently reinvesting foreign earnings overseas, 
as more fully discussed in the Form 10-Q filed for that quarter. The Company 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1995 will approximate the 39.1% rate 
for the full fiscal year 1994.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-95-000008.txt

billion, 37% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of 
the prior year. This represents a record amount of orders for any period, 
and a significant portion of our production capacity will be 
devoted to filling these orders, potentially impacting availability of 
product for ""at once"" shipments. These orders are not necessarily indicative 
of total revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of advance orders 
and ""at once"" shipments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and 
year to year. Additionally, as international operations continue to shift 
to a greater emphasis on futures orders, this mix again may vary. Finally, 
exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons. Liquidity and Capital Resources

January and February over last May's comparable two month period. Overall inventories increased $158 million since May 31. Gross U.S. footwear inventory is down $12 million due to strong demand, however, 
international inventories have increased $95 million, $30 million of which 
is due to new NIKE-owned subsidiaries with the remaining increase in

Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
 The quarter ended February 28, 1995 established a new third quarter 
high, with net income increasing 51% as a result of record revenues, gross 
margin improvement and selling and administrative expenses reducing as a 
percentage of sales. Net income for the period was $95.3 million or $1.29 
per share, compared to $63.2 million or $0.85 per share for the same period 
in the prior year. The 52% increase in earnings per share as compared to 
the 51% increase in net income is primarily due to the Company's share 
repurchase program. Revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time in a third quarter, 
increasing 29% to $1.125 billion compared to $872 million in the prior 
year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of 
$1 billion. United States apparel increased 39% ($33 million), growing at a 
slightly faster pace than the U.S. footwear business, which was up 27% 
($126 million) over the previous year due to a 21% increase in pairs 
shipped and a 5% increase in average selling price. The Company had increases 
in all categories of both U.S. footwear and apparel. International revenues 
increased $85 million, 33% over last year's third quarter, with growth in 
footwear revenues of 29% and apparel revenues of 46%. Favorable exchange 
rates contributed $16 million of the increase and new NIKE-owned subsidiaries

 The first quarter ended August 31, 1995 established new 
record highs for revenues and net income. Revenues increased 38% 
to $1.615 billion, compared to $1.170 billion in the prior year's 
first quarter. Net income was $165 million, or $2.26 per share, 
compared to $106 million, or $1.43 per share for the same period 
in the prior year. The 55% increase in net income was due to the 
record revenues as well as a decrease in selling and administrative 
expenses as a percent of revenues, from 25% in the prior year 
to 22.3% in the current year. Revenues increased $444 million over the record $1.2 billion 
reported in the same period of the prior year. U.S. footwear 
increased $136 million, or 21%, resulting from an increase of 
19% in pairs shipped and a 2% increase in average selling price due 
to sales mix. Revenues increased in all U.S. footwear categories. U.S. apparel was up $88 million over last year's first quarter, an 
increase of 93%. International revenues increased $131 million, or 
36%, composed of 33% and 48% increases in international (n0n-U.S.) 
footwear and apparel revenues, respectively. The international 
growth included a 6% increase resulting from new NIKE subsidiaries

 Consolidated gross margins were relatively flat at 40.1% 
compared to 40.2% in the prior year. Strong demand for NIKE 
products combined with sound inventory management resulted in 
stable NIKE brand margins. The Company continues to place 
strong emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign 
exchange risk, and production sourcing in order to maximize 
gross profit. Selling and administrative expenses increased $67 million in 
absolute dollars over the previous year's first quarter, however, as 
a percent of sales decreased 2.7 percentage points to 22.3%. The 
largest increase in absolute dollars was $29 million from international, 
with $12 million a result of exchange rates, $5 million from new 
subsidiaries, and the remainder due to increased levels of operations.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-95-000017.txt

marketing expenses. Canstar Sports added $12 million of expenses. The Company anticipates that total fiscal 1996 selling and 
administrative expense as a percent of revenues will 
approximate the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter increased $6.6 million over 
the prior year due to increased short term borrowings for both U.S. and international operations. Other income decreased 
$9.2 million, primarily as a result of increased goodwill expense, 
increased profit share plan expense and decreased interest income. Goodwill expense and interest income were most significantly affected 
by the acquisition of Canstar Sports. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.5% 
compared to 39.0% in the prior year. This is primarily due to 
lower taxes provided on non-U.S. earnings. The Company anticipates 
the tax rate for fiscal 1996 will approximate 38.5%. Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from September 1995 through January 1996 were 
approximately $2.3 billion, 32% higher than such orders booked in

 The Company's financial position remains strong, with working 
capital rising $119 million since May 31, 1995. The working capital 
ratio remained the same as of May 31, 1995 at 1.9:1. Cash and equivalents decreased $38 million from May 31, 1995. Cash provided by operations was reduced by increases in working capital 
components. Other significant uses of cash included 
additions to property, plant and equipment, decreases in short 
term borrowings and long term debt. The increase in working capital components was primarily due 
to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by 
increases in accounts payable and taxes payable. The increase in 
accounts receivable of $139 million was due to sales growth in both 
July and August over last May's comparable two month period. Overall 
inventories increased $47 million in conjunction with levels of 
operations, primarily due to U.S. apparel and international footwear 
and apparel inventories which have increased $18 million and $58 
million, respectively. U.S. footwear inventories decreased $29 million 
due to record shipments and timing of inventory receipts. Increases in

accounts payable and taxes payable are a result of the increased level 
of operations. The additions to property, plant and equipment were composed 
of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European

outstanding 
at May 31, 1995 and to retire long term debt acquired in the purchase 
of Canstar Sports. During the quarter, the Company purchased 200,000 shares of 
its own stock under the stock repurchase program announced in 
July 1993, bringing the total number of shares purchased in the 
program to approximately 5,149,000. In September of 1995, the Company's Board of Directors announced 
a two-for-one stock split following shareholder approval an 
increase in the number of authorized Class A and Class B Common 
shares. The stock split will be in the form of a 100 percent 
stock dividend to be paid on October 30, 1995 to shareholders of

believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources, will adequately finance anticipated

 Consolidated gross margin percentage remained flat at 39.3% and 
39.7% for the quarter and six months ended November 30, 1995, 
respectively, compared with the same periods last year. Strong demand 
for NIKE products worldwide combined with sound inventory management 
resulted in continued stable margins. The Company continues to place 
strong emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange 
risk and production sourcing in order to maximize gross profit. Gross 
profit percentages for the remaining six months of fiscal year 1996 are 
expected to be affected by strong demand for NIKE products offset by 
continued increased levels of air freight to meet the delivery dates on 
increasing customer orders. Selling and administrative expenses increased $89.7 million and 
$156.9 million for the quarter and six months ended November 30, 1995, 
respectively, compared with same periods last year. For the quarter,

U.S. NIKE brand operations accounted for the majority of the increase, 
up $57 million, primarily in planned marketing and advertising expenses. International expenses increased $20 million for the quarter over last 
year, with $4 million due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. Canstar Sports added $11 million of expenses. The Company expects to 
continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through of the 
unprecedented volume of customer orders discussed below. As a 
result, the Company expects that selling and administrative expenses as 
a percentage of revenues for the remaining six months of the this fiscal 
year will increase to levels consistent with the prior year. Interest expense increased $4.0 million and $10.7 million for the 
quarter and six months ended November 30, 1995, respectively, compared 
with the same periods last year. The increase is due to increased short 
term borrowings in the U.S. and international operations needed to fund 
current operations. In the prior year, cash and equivalents 
were higher through November 30, as available cash was subsequently used 
to fund the third quarter acquisition of Canstar Sports. Other expense 
increased $7.1 million and $16.3 million for the quarter and six months 
ended November 30, 1995, respectively, compared with the same periods 
last year. The increase is primarily due to increased goodwill 
amortization resulting from the acquisition of Canstar Sports, and 
decreased interest income from lower available cash.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000001.txt

amortization resulting from the acquisition of Canstar Sports, and 
decreased interest income from lower available cash. The Company's effective tax rate for both the quarter and six 
months ended November 30, 1995 was 38.5%, compared to 39.0% in both of 
the prior year's comparable periods. The Company anticipates that the 
tax rate will remain at 38.5% for fiscal year 1996. Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from December 1995 through April 1996 are 
approximately $2.7 billion, 34% higher than such orders booked in 
the comparable period of the prior year. These orders are not 
necessarily indicative of total revenues over that period because 
the mix of advance orders and ""at once"" shipments may vary 
significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Additionally, as international operations continue to account for 
a greater percentage of total revenues and place greater emphasis on 
futures orders, this mix again may vary. Finally, exchange 
rates can cause differences in the comparisons. Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company's financial position remains strong, with working 
capital rising $190 million since May 31, 1995. In addition, the 
working capital ratio increased from 1.8:1 at May 31, 1995 to 2.0:1 at 
November 30, 1995. Cash and equivalents decreased $11.2 million from May 31, 1995. Cash provided by operations was reduced by changes in other 
working capital components discussed below.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000001.txt

working capital components discussed below. Other significant uses of 
cash included additions to property, plant and equipment, reductions in 
long-term debt and dividends paid. The most significant source of 
cash was from an increase in notes payable. The decrease in cash due to other working capital components 
was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, 
offset by increases in accrued liabilities. The increase in accounts 
receivable of $131.6 million was due to sales growth in both October 
and November over last fiscal year's final two months. Overall 
inventories increased $81.1 million in conjunction with levels of 
operations. U.S. footwear, U.S. apparel and international footwear 
and apparel inventories have increased $20.8 million, $18.5 million 
and $30.1 million, respectively. Increases in accrued liabilities 
are a result of the increased levels of the Company's operations, 
most significantly, international operations. The additions to property, plant and equipment were composed 
of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European 
footwear warehouses, expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and 
acquisition of land adjacent to the world headquarters. The Company also utilized cash to retire long-term debt acquired in 
the purchase of Canstar Sports. Notes payable increased in order to fund the high level of 
operations. During the quarter, the Company announced a 20% increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from the previous $0.125 
per share.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000001.txt

quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from the previous $0.125

purchased 200,000 shares of its own stock under the stock repurchase 
program announced in July 1993, bringing the total number of shares 
purchased in the program to approximately 5,149,000. There were no 
purchases during the second quarter. The debt to equity ratio at November 30, 1995 was .6:1 compared 
to .6:1 at May 31, 1995 and .4:1 at November 30, 1994. Management 
believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources, will adequately finance anticipated 
fiscal 1996 expenditures. At November 30, 1995, the Company 
had $500 million available in committed unused lines of credit. Part II - Other Information Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

gross margin percentage remained flat at 39.3%, and selling and 
administrative expenses was reduced 0.7 percentage points as a

consecutive quarter of record revenues and fifth consecutive quarter of 
record net income, comopared to the same period of the prior year. Revenues for the quarter increased $389.3 million over the $1.054 
billion reported in the same period of the prior year, reflecting 
increases in nearly all categories of both footwear and apparel 
in the U.S. and internationally. U.S. revenues increased $180.9 
million, or 33%, lead by apparel which increased $97.9 million, or 100%, 
to $195.8 million compared with the second quarter last year. U.S. footwear increased $83 million, or 18%, to $538.5 million, resulting 
from a 12% increase in pairs shipped and a 6% increase in average 
selling price. Revenues from international (non-U.S.) operations

 Consolidated gross margin percentage was 39.5% for the quarter 
compared to 39.7% for last year's third quarter. For the nine months 
ended February 29,1996, margins remained flat with last year at 39.7%. Strong demand for NIKE products worldwide and sound inventory 
management are holding margins stable on a year-to-date basis. The 
Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory management, 
minimizing foreign exchange risk and production sourcing in order to 
maximize gross profit.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000003.txt

Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory management,

the remaining three months of fiscal year 1996 to be affected by strong 
demand for NIKE products offset by continued higher levels of air 
freight expense to meet the delivery dates on increasing customer 
orders.* 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased $104.4 million in 
absolute dollars for the quarter ended February 29, 1996, and as a 
percentage of revenues increased one percentage point to 25.7% compared 
to the same period last year. On a year to date basis, selling and 
administrative expenses have increased $261.4 million, but have 
decreased to 24.2% of consolidated revenues compared to 25.1% in the 
prior year. For the quarter, U.S. operations expenses increased $38.4 
million and international expenses increased $46.6 million, primarily a 
result of planned increases in marketing and advertising expenses as 
well as infrastructure to support the growth outside the U.S. Canstar 
Sports accounted for $11.1 million of the increase.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000003.txt

Sports accounted for $11.1 million of the increase. The Company intends 
to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
and advertising expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through 
of the high level of orders discussed below.* As a result, the Company 
expects selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
for the current year to approximate that of the prior year.* 
 
 Interest expense increased $5.4 million and $16.0 million for the 
quarter and nine months ended February 29, 1996, respectively, compared 
to the same period last year. The increase is due to the higher levels 
of short term borrowings in the U.S. and international needed to fund 
current operations. In the prior year, fiscal year to date average cash 
and equivalents were higher through February 28, as available cash 
was used to fund the acquisition of Canstar Sports, which occurred at 
the end of the third quarter of the prior year. Other expense 
increased $4.5 million and $20.8 million for the quarter and nine months 
ended February 29, 1996, respectively, compared to the same periods last 
year. The increase is primarily due to increased goodwill amortization 
resulting from the acquisition of Canstar Sports and decreased interest 
income from lower available cash. The Company's effective tax rate for both the quarter and nine 
months ended February 29, 1996 was 38.5% compared to 39.0% in both of 
the prior year's comparable periods.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000003.txt

months ended February 29, 1996 was 38.5% compared to 39.0% in both of 
the prior year's comparable periods. The Company anticipates the tax 
rate will remain at 38.5% for fiscal year 1996.* 
 
 Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from March 1996 through July 1996 were 
approximately $3.4 billion, 38% higher than such orders booked in the 
comparable period of the prior year. These orders are not necessarily 
indicative of total revenues over that period because the mix of advance 
orders and at once shipments may vary significantly from quarter to 
quarter and year to year. Additionally, as international operations 
continue to account for a greater percentage of total revenues and place 
a greater emphasis on futures orders, this mix again may vary. Finally, 
exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons. Currently certain of the Company's international operations report 
their results of operations on a one month lag which allows more time to 
compile their results. As further discussed in Note 5 to these 
financial statements, the Company will eliminate this one month lag 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997. The change should 
not have a material effect on the annual results of operations, however, 
quarterly results will change as certain reporting periods will shift 
one month.*

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company's financial position remains strong, with working 
capital rising $257.8 million since May 31, 1995. The working capital 
ratio increased from 1.8:1 at May 31, 1995 to 1.9:1 at February 29, 1996. Cash and equivalents increased $43.4 million from May 31, 1995. Cash provided by operations was reduced by changes in other 
working capital components discussed below. Other significant uses of 
cash included additions to property, plant and equipment, reductions in 
long-term debt and the dividends payment. The most significant source of 
cash was from an increase in notes payable. The decrease in other working capital components was due primarily 
to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by 
increases in accounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable 
of $115.8 million was due to sales growth in both January and February 
over last fiscal year's final two months. Overall inventories 
increased $250.9 million. U.S. footwear, U.S. apparel and international 
footwear and apparel inventories have increased $13.2 million, $68.0 million 
and $129.0 million, respectively. Increases in accounts payable are a result 
of the increased levels of the Company's operations, most significantly, 
international operations. The additions to property, plant and equipment were composed 
of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European 
footwear warehouses, expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and 
acquisition of land adjacent to the world headquarters.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000003.txt

of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European 
footwear warehouses, expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and

the purchase of Canstar Sports. Notes payable increased in order to fund the high level of 
operations. For the nine months ended February 29, 1996, the Company has 
purchased 200,000 shares of its own stock under the stock repurchase 
program announced in July 1993, bringing the total number of shares 
purchased in the program to approximately 5,149,000. There were no 
purchases during the third quarter. The debt to equity ratio at February 29, 1996 was .6:1 compared 
to .6:1 at May 31, 1995 and .5:1 at February 28, 1995. Management 
believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources, will adequately finance anticipated 
fiscal 1996 expenditures.* At February 29, 1996, the Company 
had $500 million available in committed unused lines of credit. *The marked items are forward-looking statements that involve risks and

 Net income increased 19.3% for the fiscal third quarter ended 
February 29, 1996 over the same period last year. Continued strong 
revenue growth was the primary factor in record results for the 
quarter, increasing 32.6% over last year. This represents the 
Company's sixth straight quarter of double digit increases in total 
revenues and net income. For the nine months ended February 29, 1996, 
net income increased 38.6%, again on strong revenue growth of 35.8% 
and a reduction of selling and administrative costs as percentage of 
revenues from 25.1% to 24.2%, which was offset by an increase in 
interest and other expenses. The Company believes the continued 
strong revenues and earnings growth is a result of the strength of 
the NIKE Brand, with a focused effort on new and innovative product 
in all areas of the business. In addition, the Company continues 
to focus on developing the NIKE Brand outside the U.S., where sales 
for the trailing 12 month period surpassed the $2 billion level for 
the first time. The Company experienced double digit revenue growth during the 
quarter and nine months ended February 29, 1996 across all the 
breakout categories (see chart), with the most significant increase 
in U.S. apparel, which grew $100.5 million, or 85.1%, and $286.1 
million, or 92.1%, respectively. For the quarter, U.S. apparel 
exceeded $200 million for the first time ever. U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000003.txt

increased $65.0 million, or $10.8%, and $284.5 million, or 16.6%, 
for the three and nine months ended February 29, 1996, respectively. For the quarter, the increase in U.S. footwear was a result of a 12% 
increase in pairs sold and 1% reduction in average selling prices. Men's basketball, men's and kids' cross training and women's fitness 
dominated the U.S. footwear category. International revenues increased 
$153.2 million, or 44.3%, and $417.6 million, or 36.4%, for the three 
and nine months ended February 29, 1996, respectively. Excluding the 
positive effects of a weaker U.S. dollar, third quarter international 
revenues grew 42%. For the quarter on a constant dollar basis, all 
regions experienced strong double digit growth, with the most 
significant increases in Europe and Asia Pacific regions up 45% and 46%, 
respectively. For the nine months ended February 29, 1996, Europe is up 
29% and Asia Pacific is up 37% compared to the prior year. Other 
Brands, which includes Cole Haan (R), Tetra Plastics, Sports Specialties 
and Canstar Sports, increased $48.3 million or 84.1%, and $212.3 
million, or 120.1%, for the three and nine months ended February 29,

 Net income increased 24% over the prior year's first quarter 
to $226.1 million, or $1.53 per share, from $182.1 million, or 
$1.25 per share. Revenues totaled $2.28 billion, up 34% from $1.70 
billion in last year's first quarter, the first time that revenues 
exceeded $2 billion in one quarter. This period also marks the eighth 
straight quarter of double digit increases in total revenues. Gross 
margin percentage remained consistent with the prior year's first 
quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were 23.2% of 
revenue compared to 21.7% in the prior year. Revenues for the quarter increased $581.9 million over the $1.7 
billion reported in the same period of the prior year. U.S. revenues 
increased $380 million, or 39%. U.S. apparel increased 93% over last 
year's first quarter, the second consecutive quarter that U.S. apparel 
exceeded $200 million in revenues and the first time revenues 
exceeded $1 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. U.S. footwear 
increased $210.5 million, or 26.6%, over last year due to a 24% increase 
in pairs sold and a 3% increase in average selling price. These 
increases were primarily due to men's basketball, up 48%, and women's 
business, up 38%. Golf increased 124%. For the quarter, international 
revenue increased $202.8 million, or 35%, over last year. All regions 
showed double digit increases with Europe up 29%, Asia Pacific up 50% 
and the Americas region up 36%.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000018.txt

(1) For comparable purposes with 1996, results for the three months ended 
August 31, 1995 have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the 
one month lag in reporting by certain of the Company's international 
operations. See further discussion under Note 5. Consolidated gross margin percentage remained relatively flat at 
40.3% for the quarter compared to 40.4% for last year's first quarter, 
due to continued strong demand for NIKE products worldwide combined 
with sound inventory management. The Company continues to place strong 
emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange risk and 
production sourcing in order to maximize gross profit.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000018.txt
1719,0000320187-96-000018-2,0000320187-96-000018,NKE,,1996-10-15,sec,10-Q,2,md&a,MD&A,2,,,"The Company continues to place strong 
emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange risk and 
production sourcing in order to maximize gross profit. Gross profit 
percentages for the remainder of fiscal year 1997 are expected to be 
affected by strong demand for NIKE products offset by continued 
increased levels of air freight to meet the delivery dates on increasing 
customer orders. The gross profit percentage for the full year is 
expected to approximate last fiscal year's percentage.* 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased $160 million over 
the previous year's first quarter and increased as a percent of sales 
to 23.2%, compared to 21.7% in last year's first quarter. The majority 
of the increase in absolute dollars and percentage increases occurred in 
the U.S. and Europe due to planned marketing and advertising 
expenditures relating to the Olympics and the European soccer 
championships. It is expected that selling and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year will approximate last 
year's level.* 
 
 Interest expense increased slightly over the prior 
year due to increased short term borrowings for increased operations. The Company's Japanese subsidiary entered into a new long-term debt 
arrangement, as further discussed below. The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38.7% 
compared to 38.5% in the prior year's first quarter. The slight 
increase was due to higher tax on foreign earnings.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000018.txt
1720,0000320187-96-000018-3,0000320187-96-000018,NKE,,1996-10-15,sec,10-Q,2,md&a,MD&A,3,,,"The slight 
increase was due to higher tax on foreign earnings. The Company 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1997 will remain at 
approximately 38.7%.* 
 
 Worldwide future and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic 
footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from September 1996 
through January 1997 were approximately $3.5 billion, 66% higher than 
such orders booked in the comparable period of the prior year.* These 
orders and the percentage growth in these orders are not necessarily 
indicative of the growth in revenues which the Company will experience 
for the subsequent periods. This is because the mix of advance futures 
and ""at once"" orders has shifted significantly toward furtures orders as 
the NIKE brand became more established in all areas, specifically in the 
U.S. apparel business and in international regions. The mix of advance 
orders to ""at once"" orders will continue to vary as the U.S. apparel 
business and international operations continue to account for a greater 
percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on futures 
programs.* Finally, exchange rates can cause differences in the 
comparisons. As further explained in Note 5, prior to fiscal year 1997, certain 
of the Company's international operations reported their results of 
operations on a one month lag which allowed more time to compile 
results. The Company has taken steps to improve its internal reporting 
procedures that has allowed for more timely reporting of these 
operations. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one 
month lag was eliminated.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000018.txt

month lag was eliminated. The May 1996 loss from operations for these 
entities of $4.1 million was recorded directly to retained earnings. The income statement and cash flow statement for the quarter ended 
August 31, 1995 have been presented as if these entities reported on 
a same month basis. There was no unusual activity in the month of May 
1996 for the entities affected by the change to concurrent month reporting. The cash flow for the month was impacted mainly by changes in working 
capital components due to increased operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
_______________________________ 
 
 The Company's financial position remains strong at August 31, 1996. Since May 31, 1996, total assets grew $474 million to approximately $4.4 
billion and shareholder's equity increased $226 million to nearly $2.7 
billion. Working capital increased $257 million as a result of higher 
levels of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable offset by increased 
notes payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. The Company's 
current ratio increased compared to May 31, 1996 from 1.86:1 to 1.93:1. Since May 31, 1996, cash and equivalents increased $136 million (52%) 
and accounts receivable increased $281 million (21%) due to the high 
level of first quarter revenues compared to the same period in the prior 
year. Inventory levels decreased $22 million from May 31, the most 
significant change coming from U.S. footwear which decreased $47 million 
due to the large selling season.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000018.txt

due to the large selling season. Current liabilities increased $160 million from May 31, 1996, with 
the most significant increases occurring in notes payable ($94 million) 
and accrued liabilities ($45 million) due to higher a level of operations 
and income taxes payable ($62 million) due to timing of tax payments. Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first quarter of 
fiscal 1997 were $74 million with the most significant components 
related to the continued consolidation of European footwear warehouses, 
the expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and the expansion of warehouses 
in the U.S. Long-term debt increased $98 million from May 31, 1996. The increase 
was due almost entirely to the Company's Japanese subsidiary which borrowed 
10.5 billion Japanese yen in a private placement with a maturity of 
June 26, 2011. Dividends per share of common stock for the first quarter of fiscal 
1997 was $.15 per share compared to $.125 per share for the first 
quarter of fiscal 1996. In September of 1996, the Company's Board of Directors announced a 
two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to 
be paid on October 23, 1996 to shareholders of record on October 11, 1996. The Company's commercial paper program requires the support of 
committed and uncommitted lines of credit. There was $88 million 
outstanding under this program at August 31, 1996.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-96-000018.txt

outstanding under this program at August 31, 1996. The Company has 
$500 million available in committed unused lines of credit and, at 
August 31, 1996, no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility. NIKE's debt-to-equity ratio at August 31, 1996 was .7:1, compared to 
 .6:1 at May 31, 1996. Management believes that funds generated by operations, together 
with currently available resources and anticipated long-term debt 
arrangements, will continue to adequately finance anticipated fiscal 
1997 expenditures.*

(1) For comparable purposes with 1996, results for the three and six months 
ended November 30, 1995 have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of 
the one month lag in reporting by certain of the Company's international 
operations. See further discussion under Note 5. Consolidated gross margin percentage was 39.4% for the quarter 
compared to 39.0% for last year's second quarter. Year-to-date margins 
are at 39.9% compared to 39.8% for last year. The increase in gross 
margin percentage is primarily attributed to footwear price increases 
taking effect in this quarter as well as changes to product and customer 
mix during the period. The Company continues to place strong emphasis 
on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange risk and production 
sourcing in order to maximize gross profit.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000001.txt

on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange risk and production 
sourcing in order to maximize gross profit. Gross profit percentages 
for the remainder of fiscal year 1997 are expected to be affected by 
both strong demand for NIKE products and increased pricing levels, 
offset by increased levels of air freight to meet the delivery dates or 
increasing customer orders. At this time, Management expects the 
percentage for the full year to be up only slightly from last fiscal 
year's percentage.* 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased $177 million over the 
previous year's second quarter and $337 million year-to-date. As a 
percentage of revenues, expenses have decreased to 25.2% for the 
quarter, down from 26.1% for the same period last year. On a 
year-to-date basis, expenses have increased to 24.2%, up from 23.6%. For the quarter, the revenue growth outstripped the expenses, 
resulting in a lower percentage, however, increased spending on 
advertising and marketing, as well as increased infrastructure costs, 
make up the majority of both the dollar and percentage increases. At 
this time, Management expects selling and administrative expenses as a 
percentage of revenues for the year will approximate the prior year.* 
 
 Interest expense increased for both the quarter and year-to-date 
over the prior year due to increased short-term borrowings for growing 
operations, mostly in Europe and Asia Pacific.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000001.txt

 Interest expense increased for both the quarter and year-to-date 
over the prior year due to increased short-term borrowings for growing 
operations, mostly in Europe and Asia Pacific. Other expense decreased 
$7.5 million for the quarter and $9.1 million year-to-date primarily due 
to decreased conversion loss on foreign transactions, gains on the 
disposal of fixed assets, and income earned from a promotional event in 
Japan. The Company's effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 38.75% 
compared to 38.5% in the prior year. The slight increase is due 
primarily to higher state income taxes on U.S. earnings. At this time, 
Management anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1997 will remain at 
approximately 38.75%.* 
 
 Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from December 1996 through April 1997 were 
approximately $4.1 billion, 54% higher than such orders booked in the 
comparable period of the prior year. These orders and the percentage 
growth in these orders are not necessarily indicative of the growth in 
revenues which the Company will experience for the subsequent periods. This is because the mix of advance futures and ""at once"" orders has 
shifted significantly toward futures orders as the NIKE brand becomes 
more established in all areas, specifically in the U.S. apparel business 
and in international regions. The mix of advance orders to ""at once"" 
orders will continue to vary as the U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000001.txt

comparisons.*
 
 As further explained in Note 5, prior to fiscal year 1997, certain 
of the Company's international operations reported their results of 
operations on a one month lag in order to allow more time for compiling 
results. The Company has taken steps to improve its internal reporting 
procedures which have allowed for more timely reporting of these 
operations. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one 
month lag was eliminated. As a result, the May 1996 operational results 
for these entities of a $4.1 million loss was recorded to retained 
earnings in the first quarter of the current year. The change affected 
the previously reported quarterly periods for these operations, and 
thus, the income statement and cash flow statement have been adjusted in 
order to show comparable results for the previous periods as if the 
change had occurred in the prior year. Throughout this discussion, 
comparisons to last year are also stated as they would have appeared had 
these entities reported on a same month basis. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 The Company's financial position remains strong at November 30, 1996. Since May 31, 1996, total assets grew $470 million to approximately $4.4

increased to 2.10:1 at November 30, 1996 from 1.86:1 at May 31, 1996. Cash provided by operations included year-to-date net income of $403 
million plus the year-to-date non-cash depreciation charge of $58 million. Cash used by changes in other working capital components totaled $354 million 
due, in large part, to increases in accounts receivable and inventory. Since 
May 31, 1996, accounts receivable increased $226 million (17%) due to the high 
level of revenues compared to the same period in the prior year. Inventory 
levels increased $50 million from May 31, as total international inventory 
increased $52 million in order to support revenue volume. Inventory turns 
increased to 5.56 at November 30, 1996 from 5.01 at May 31, 1996. Cash used in investing activities totaled $203 million for the first six 
months of fiscal 1997. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled 
$188 million with the most significant components related to the continued 
consolidation of European footwear warehouses, the overall expansion of U.S. operations and the continued expansion of NIKE Town retail locations in 
the U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000001.txt

the U.S. Cash provided from financing activities included an increase from 
May 31, 1996 of $100 million in long-term debt due, primarily, to the 
Company's Japanese subsidiary borrowing 10.5 billion yen in the first 
quarter. Cash was used to decrease notes payable by $28 million and to 
pay dividends totaling $43 million. During the quarter, the Company announced a 33% increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend to $.10 per share from the previous $.075 per share. The Company's commercial paper program requires the support of committed 
and uncommitted lines of credit. There was $6 million outstanding under 
this program at November 30, 1996. The Company has $500 million available in 
committed unused lines of credit and, at November 30, 1996, no amounts were 
outstanding under this credit facility. NIKE's debt-to-equity ratio at 
November 30, 1996 remained constant from May 31 at .6:1. In December of 1996, the Company issued $200 million of seven-year notes, 
maturing December 1, 2003 (see Note 6). The proceeds from the sale of the

entire 1995 fiscal year. Revenues were $2.1 billion, up 55% for the 
quarter and 44% year-to-date. This quarter is the ninth straight 
quarter of double digit increases in total revenues. Gross margin 
percentage increased slightly for both the quarter and year-to- 
date, while selling and administrative expenses decreased as a 
percentage of revenues for the quarter, but increased as a percentage 
of revenues on a year-to-date basis. Revenues for the quarter increased $750.3 million over

$4.3 billion, 34% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period 
of the prior year. These orders and the percentage growth in these orders 
are not necessarily indicative of the growth in revenues which the Company 
will experience for the subsequent periods. This is because the mix of 
advance futures and ""at once"" orders has shifted significantly toward 
futures orders as the NIKE brand became more established in all areas, 
specifically in the U.S. apparel business and in international regions. The mix of advance orders to ""at once"" orders will continue to vary as the 
U.S. apparel business and international operations continue to account for 
a greater percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on 
futures programs.* Finally, exchange rates can cause differences in the 
comparisons.* 
 
 As further explained in Note 5, prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of 
the Company's international operations reported their results of operations 
on a one month lag which allowed more time to compile results. The Company 
has taken steps to improve its internal reporting procedures that has 
allowed for more timely reporting of these operations. Beginning in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000003.txt

a result, the May 1996 results of operations for these entities of $4.1

if the change would have occurred in the prior year. Throughout this 
discussion, comparisons for last year are stated as they would have appeared 
had these entities reported on a same month basis. Liquidity and Capital Resources 
_______________________________ 
 
 The Company's financial position remains strong at February 28, 1997. Since May 31, 1996, total assets grew $993 million to $4.9 billion and 
shareholders' equity increased $583 million to $3.0 billion. Working capital 
increased $637 million, and the Company's current ratio increased to 2.2 at 
February 28, 1997 from 1.9 at May 31, 1996. Changes in other working capital components totaled $701 million, due 
primarily to significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory. Since May 31, 1996, accounts receivable increased $504 million or 37%, 
due to higher levels of revenues compared with the fourth quarter of the 
prior year. Inventory levels increased $158 million from May 31, consistent 
with the growth of the business. U.S. inventory levels increased $57 million 
on U.S. footwear's $44 million increase. U.S. footwear inventory turns 
increased to 9.1 from 8.1 at May 31,1996.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000003.txt

increased to 9.1 from 8.1 at May 31,1996. Outside of the U.S., inventory 
increased $92 million in the Asia Pacific region, the majority of the 
increase coming from the Company's Japanese subsidiary due to revenue 
growth. Consolidated inventory turns increased to 5.3 compared to 5.0 at 
May 31, 1996. All other components of working capital changed only slightly 
compared to May 31, 1996. An increase in other current assets was offset by 
an increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments. Additions to property, plant and equipment in the U.S. totaled $206 
million for the first three quarters of fiscal 1997 due to the continued 
overall expansion of U.S. operations which included warehouse locations 
and the continued development of NIKE Town retail stores. Additions to 
property, plant and equipment outside of the U.S. accounted for $86 million 
of the $318 million total. The most significant increase relates to 
expansion of the European warehouses. In addition to the increases in 
property, plant and equipment, other assets increased from May 31, 1996, 
due primarily to advance payments made in fiscal 1997 for long-term 
endorsement contracts. Cash was provided from financing activities through an increase of 
$289 million in long-term debt to fund growing operations, including 
infrastructure. In December, 1996, the Company issued $200 million 
seven-year notes, maturing December 1, 2003. The proceeds were subsequently 
swapped into Dutch Guilders and then loaned to a European subsidiary.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000003.txt

from this intercompany loan will be used by the subsidiary to retire

yen (approximately $100 million) borrowed by the Company's Japanese 
subsidiary in the first quarter, account for the majority of the increase 
in long-term debt. The Company's commercial paper program requires the support of 
committed and uncommitted lines of credit. The Company borrows against 
its commercial paper program and, at February 28, 1997, there was $158 
million outstanding. The Company has $500 million available in committed, 
unused lines of credit and, at quarter-end, no amounts were outstanding 
under this credit facility. NIKE's debt-to-equity ratio at February 28, 
1997 remained constant from May 31 at 0.6. Management believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources and long-term debt arrangements, will 
continue to adequately finance anticipated fiscal 1997 expenditures.*

 Net income increased 77% over the prior year's third quarter and 55% on 
a year-to-date basis. For the quarter, in comparison to last years third 
quarter, the increase in net income was attributed primarily to an 
increase in revenues of 53% (to a record $2.4 billion), an increase in 
gross margin percentage from 39.7% to 40.8% and improved leverage of 
selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. For the 
nine months ended February 28, 1997, net income was up 55% over the 
same period last year, driven by an increase in revenues of 47% and 
an improved gross margin percentage. NIKE brand revenues increases for the quarter and year-to-date, compared 
with the same periods last year, were driven by the strength of the brand on 
a global basis. U.S apparel increases for the quarter and year-to-date were 
driven by increases in training, accessories and kids' categories. U.S. footwear for the quarter increased $313.6 million or 47%, due to an increase 
of 34% pairs sold and an 10% increase in average selling prices. Nearly every 
footwear category experienced increases. For the year, the largest category 
increases in terms of total dollars were men's basketball, up 47%, women's 
fitness, up 60%, kids' footwear, up 60%, and men's running, up 73%. Other 
categories showing large percentage increases included golf and soccer. All regions outside the U.S. experienced significant revenue increases 
for the quarter and year-to-date.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000003.txt

August 31, 1997, an increase of $116 million over last year's first quarter, 
primarily due to decreased working capital requirements as a result of lower 
first quarter growth rates in the U.S. compared to the first quarter of 
fiscal 1997. Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first three months of 
fiscal 1998 were $109 million. Additions in the U.S. totaled $48 million 
for the quarter due to continued overall expansion of U.S. operations which 
includes warehouse locations, world headquarters expansion, management 
information systems and the continued development of NIKETOWN retail 
locations. Outside the U.S., additions totaled $57 million and is largely 
attributable to the development and expansion of new and existing warehouse 
facilities. In addition to the increases in property, plant and equipment, 
other assets increased from May 31, 1997 due primarily to advance payments 
made in the first quarter for long-term endorsement contracts. Additions to long-term debt totaled $102 million in the first quarter of 
fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1997 the Company filed a shelf registration with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of up to $500 million of debt 
securities. Under this program, the Company issued $100 million medium term

notes on June 16, 1997, maturing in three to five years. The proceeds were

this long-term fixed rate debt financing, in addition to excess cash, to pay 
down the Company's European short-term debt. This resulted in a net reduction 
of $124 million in notes payable in the first quarter of fiscal 1998. Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, together 
with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs. Significant short and long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks 
which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity. Liquidity is also provided by the Company's commercial paper program under 
which there was $0 outstanding at August 31, 1997. Dividends per share of common stock for the first quarter of fiscal 1998 was 
$.10 per share compared to $.075 per share for the first quarter of fiscal

Net income for the three months ended August 31, 1997 increased 12% to a 
record $253.1 million ($0.85 per share), compared to $226.1 ($0.76 per 
share) for the same period last year. Total revenues increased to a 
record $2.77 billion, an increase of 21% over the prior year's first 
quarter of $2.28 billion. This represents 14 and 12 consecutive 
comparable quarter increases in revenues and net income, respectively. Gross margins for the quarter were 39.8% of revenues, compared to 40.3% 
in the prior year. Selling and administrative costs were 23.8% of 
revenues, compared to 23.2% in the prior year. A key component to the revenue increase for the quarter was non-U.S. footwear and apparel brand revenues, which topped $1 billion in a fiscal 
quarter for the first time, representing an increase of 46% over the 
prior year. Had the U.S. dollar remained constant with that of the 
prior year, non-U.S. revenues would have increased 60%. Europe 
increased 34% (51% on a constant dollar basis), Asia Pacific increased 
68% (78% on a constant dollar basis), and the Americas (which includes 
Canada and Latin America) increased 60% (61% on a constant dollar 
basis). U.S. brand footwear and apparel revenues increased $133.0 million, or 
10%, over the prior year. Key U.S. apparel growth categories included 
golf, running, outdoor and soccer, all of which experienced double digit 
increases in the quarter. The U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000009.txt

2% increase in pairs sold and a 3% increase in average selling price. Basketball, cross training, running and kids comprise approximately 80% 
of the total U.S. footwear business, and individually increased 2%, 3%, 
11%, and 23%, respectively. Of the remaining U.S. categories, golf and 
soccer experienced revenue increases of 68% and 130%, respectively, 
while outdoor and court each experienced reductions of 19%. Other and 
Other Brands, which includes NIKE brand equipment, Bauer Inc., Cole 
Haan, Sports Specialties, Corp., and Tetra Plastics., decreased 3% to 
$148.4 million. Management expects revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal 1998 to be 
affected by the strong demand for the NIKE brand on a global scale. However, given the rate of revenue increases in recent years, which 
resulted in significant market share gains, the overall rate of growth 
will be lower than that experienced in prior years, most predominately 
in the U.S. The breakdown of revenues follows:

 ========== ========== 
 
The reduction in gross margins as a percentage of revenues, compared 
with the prior year's first quarter, is primarily attributable to 
increased air freight costs, higher levels of research, design and 
development costs, and product mix, including, increased sales of lower 
priced products. Management expects the fiscal 1998 gross margin 
percentage to be lower than the prior year, primarily due to higher 
product costs, increased spending on infrastructure to support the 
higher levels of operations, and increased sales of lower priced 
products, including close-outs. Selling and administrative expenses increased $129 million over the 
previous year's first quarter. The majority of the increase in absolute 
dollars is attributable to planned increased spending to support the 
growth in the business, including infrastructure related costs and 
endorsements contracts. Total advertising expenses decreased as a 
result of the increased spending around the Olympics and the European 
soccer championships last year. The Company continues to invest in 
growth opportunities, most predominately outside the U.S., and expects 
that selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
will be slightly higher than the prior year. The increase in total interest expense for the quarter, compared to the 
prior year, is due to higher borrowing levels to support the growth in 
the business, most predominately outside the U.S.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-97-000009.txt

prior year, is due to higher borrowing levels to support the growth in 
the business, most predominately outside the U.S. Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear 
and apparel scheduled for delivery from September 1997 through January 1998 
were approximately $3.9 billion, 10% higher than such orders booked in the 
comparable period of the prior year. These orders and the percentage growth 
in these orders are not necessarily indicative of the growth in revenues which 
the Company will experience for subsequent periods. This is due to the 
significant shift in the mix of advance futures orders and orders at once 
toward advance futures orders as the NIKE brand and futures programs become 
more established in all areas, specifically in the non-U.S. regions. The mix 
of orders will continue to vary as the non-U.S. operations continue to account 
for a greater percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on 
futures programs. Finally, exchange rates can cause differences in the 
comparisons. The Company is heavily dependent upon complex computer systems for 
all phases of its operations, including production, sales, distribution 
and delivery. Since many of the Company's older computer software 
programs recognize only the last two digits of the year in any date 
(e.g., ""97"" for ""1997""), some software may fail to operate properly in 
1999 or 2000 if the software is not reprogrammed or replaced (the ""Year

with the prior year's second quarter, was primarily attributable to a 
higher percentage of close-out product sales and, to a lesser extent, 
higher levels of research, design and development costs. The increased 
mix of close-out product sales compared to total sales is a result of 
increased inventory levels from the sudden slow-down in key Asian 
markets, the sluggish U.S. retail environment and European sales 
returning to a more normal level of close-out sales as a percentage of 
total sales. Management expects the fiscal 1998 gross margin percentage 
to be lower than the prior year, primarily due to higher levels of 
close-out sales and increased sales of lower priced products, higher 
product costs and increased spending on infrastructure to support the 
higher levels of operations. Selling and administrative expenses increased $62.6 million over the 
previous year's second quarter and $192.0 million year-to-date. The 
majority of the increase wass attributable to planned increased spending 
to support the long-term growth in the business, including personnel - 
and other infrastructure-related costs and endorsement contracts. The 
Company continues to invest in long-term growth plans, more 
predominately outside the U.S., and expects that selling and 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will be higher than 
the prior year. Interest expense increased for both the quarter and year-to-date over 
the prior year due to increased short-term borrowings for growing 
operations, predominately outside the U.S., financing increased 
inventories and receivables.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000002.txt

the prior year due to increased short-term borrowings for growing

$6.5 million for the quarter due to non-recurring income items 
experienced in the prior year, principally a promotional event in Japan 
and conversion gains on foreign transactions. Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear 
and apparel scheduled for delivery from December 1997 through April 1998 
totaled $4.2 billion, one percent lower than such orders for the same 
period last year. These orders and the percentage change in these orders 
are not necessarily indicative of the change in revenues which the 
Company will experience for subsequent periods. This is due to 
potential shifts in the mix of advance futures orders in relation to at 
once orders and varying cancellation rates. Finally exchange rate 
fluctuations will also cause differences in the comparisons. The 
relative flat rate of growth in futures compared with the same period 
last year is a result of lower than expected orders in the Asian 
markets, most notably Japan, difficult growth comparisons against high 
prior year base levels and the sluggish U.S. retail environment. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

billion while shareholder's equity increased $300 million to $3.5 billion. Working capital increased $216 million, to $2.2 billion, and the Company's 
current ratio increased to 2.5 at November 30, 1997 from 2.1 at 1997 
fiscal year-end. The increase in working capital was due to higher 
inventory levels resulting from the slowdown in the Asian economies and an 
increase in order cancellations coupled with the shift in debt from 
short-term to long-term. Cash provided by operations was $289 million for the six months ended 
November 30, 1997, an increase of $164 million over last year's first 
six months, primarily due to decreased working capital requirements as a 
result of lower growth rates in the U.S. compared to the first six months 
of fiscal 1997. Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first six months of 
fiscal 1998 were $242 million. Additions in the U.S. totaled $102 
million due to continued overall expansion of U.S. operations which included 
warehouse locations, world headquarters expansion, management information 
systems and the continued development of NIKETOWN retail locations. Outside 
the U.S., additions totaled $131 million and was largely attributable to the 
development and expansion of new and existing warehouse facilities. In 
addition to the increases in property, plant and equipment, other assets 
increased from May 31, 1997 due, in large part, to advance payments made in 
the first quarter for long-term endorsement contracts.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000002.txt

addition to the increases in property, plant and equipment, other assets 
increased from May 31, 1997 due, in large part, to advance payments made in 
the first quarter for long-term endorsement contracts. Additions to long-term debt totaled $101 million for the first six months 
of fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1997 the Company filed a shelf registration with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of up to $500 million 
of debt securities. Under this program, the Company issued $100 million 
medium term notes in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, maturing in three 
to five years. The proceeds were swapped into Dutch Guilders and 
the Company used this long-term fixed rate debt financing, in addition to 
excess cash, to pay down the Company's European short-term debt. This 
resulted in a net reduction of $311 million in notes payable in the first 
two quarters of fiscal 1998. Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, together 
with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs. Significant short and long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks

revenues were down three percent in the quarter and increased one 
percent on a year-to-date basis. The primary reason for the decline in 
U. S. footwear revenues for the quarter and relative flat comparison on

due to NIKE brand equipment increases against a relatively small base 
partially offset by a decline in the Other Brands. The Company expects total revenue growth for fiscal 1998 to be slightly 
higher than the prior year. The reduced level of growth 
rates compared with recent years reflects the sluggish U.S. retail 
environment and the significant downturn in the Asian markets, offset by 
growth in Europe and the Americas. The breakdown of revenues follows: (in thousands)

The overall decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for 
both the quarter and year-to-date, compared to the prior year, was due 
to four principal factors. First was the increase in close-out product 
sales compared to the prior year. The regions most affected by this 
were the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Second, inventory reserves increased 
to write down slow-moving inventory that has been unable to be sold in 
the marketplace. Third, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a 
direct impact on the Company's ability to price product in competitive 
markets. Finally, increased levels of warehousing, royalties, and 
research and development costs have had the effect of lowering margins 
due to the smaller revenue base.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

research and development costs have had the effect of lowering margins 
due to the smaller revenue base. Management expects that the gross 
margin percentage for fiscal 1998 will continue to be below levels 
experienced in the prior year. Selling and administrative expenses increased $73.8 million over the 
previous year's third quarter and $265.8 million year-to-date. The 
increases are due to higher levels of marketing expenses, including 
spending in the third quarter surrounding the Winter Olympics and 
endorsement contracts. Infrastructure spending has also increased, 
however wage-related increases over the prior year are beginning to slow 
down as cost-cutting measures take effect. Selling and administrative 
expenses are expected to remain higher than last year's levels, as a 
percentage of revenue, through the end of fiscal 1998. Interest expense, while down for the third quarter, increased on a 
year-to-date basis due to increased debt, both short and long-term, for 
growing infrastructure and financing increased levels of inventory. Other expense has increased on a year-to-date basis, primarily due to 
decreased interest income and increased losses on foreign transactions, 
offset by decreased profit sharing expense. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.4% compared 
to 38.75% in the prior year. Year-to-date the rate has risen to 38.8% 
compared to 38.7%. The increase in the rate is primarily due to a lower 
mix of non-U.S. earnings to total.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

and apparel scheduled for delivery from March 1998 through July 1998 
totaled $4.0 billion, 9% lower than such orders for the same period last 
year. These orders and the percentage change in these orders are not 
necessarily indicative of the change in revenues which the Company will 
experience for subsequent periods. This is due to potential shifts in 
the mix of advance orders in relation to at once orders and varying 
cancellation rates. Finally exchange rate fluctuations will also cause 
differences in the comparisons. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
_______________________________ 
 
The Company's financial position remains strong at February 28, 1998. Compared to May 31, 1997, total assets increased $277 million to $5.6 
billion while shareholder's equity increased $219 million to $3.4 
billion. Working capital increased $92 million, to $2.1 billion at 
February 28, 1998, and the Company's current ratio was unchanged 
from fiscal year-end at 2.1. The increase in working capital is 
primarily a result of higher inventory levels due to the slow down in 
revenue growth. The Company has taken steps to reduce inventory levels. These include actions to sell close-out inventory as well as to moderate 
inventory purchases to more cautiously match up with futures orders and 
at-once demand.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

inventory purchases to more cautiously match up with futures orders and 
at-once demand. Cash provided by operations was $161 million for the nine months ended 
February 28,1998, an increase of $104 million over last year's first nine 
months, primarily due to decreased working capital requirements as a 
result of lower growth rates compared to the first nine months of 
fiscal 1997. Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first nine months of 
fiscal 1998 were $352 million compared to $318 million for the same 
period last year. Additions in the U.S. totaled $158 million due to 
continued overall expansion of U.S. operations which includes warehouse 
locations, world headquarters expansion, management information systems 
and the continued development of retail locations. Outside the U.S., 
additions totaled $181 million due to the development and expansion of 
new and existing warehouse facilities as well as the development of 
retail locations. The Company expects total capital expenditures for 
fiscal 1998 to be approximately $550 million. Additions to long-term debt totaled $101 million for the first nine 
months of fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1997 the Company filed a shelf 
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale 
of up to $500 million of debt securities. Under this program, the 
Company issued $100 million medium term notes in the first quarter of 
fiscal 1998, maturing in three and five years.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

Company issued $100 million medium term notes in the first quarter of

into Dutch Guilders and the Company used this long-term fixed rate debt 
financing, in addition to excess cash, to retire the Company's Dutch 
Guilder external short-term debt. Management believes that significant 
funds generated by operations, together with access to sufficient sources 
of funds, will adequately meet its anticipated operating, global 
infrastructure expansion and capital needs. Significant short and 
long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks which, along with 
cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity. Liquidity is also 
provided by the Company's commercial paper program, under which there was 
$328 million outstanding at February 28, 1998. During the quarter, the Company purchased a total of 2.7 million shares 
of NIKE's Class B common stock for $123.2 million, completing the $450 
million program approved in July 1993 and beginning the four-year, $1 
billion program approved in December 1997. In the quarter, 2.4 million 
shares were purchased under the July 1993 program for $108.2 million. Total shares purchased since July 1993 were 23.8 million. Under the new

Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 1998 decreased 69% to 
$73.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $237.1 million, 
or $0.80 per diluted share last year. Year to date, net income decreased 
27%. Revenues decreased 8% for the quarter, while increasing 6% on a 
year-to-date basis. For the quarter, gross margins decreased to 35.8% 
compared to 40.8% last year. Year-to-date margins were 37.8% compared to 
40.2% in the prior year. Selling and administrative expenses increased as 
a percentage of revenue to 29.3% for the quarter and 26.3% year-to-date, 
compared to 23.8% and 24.0% for the previous year's quarter and 
year-to-date, respectively. The Company's results of operations for the 
quarter and nine months ended February 28, 1998 are most significantly a 
result of lower growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions. In 
the U.S., both footwear and apparel revenues declined in the quarter, 
primarily due to the saturation of retail athletic footwear and apparel 
markets. In Asia Pacific, the recent economic crisis in key markets in 
that region has resulted in reduced consumer spending. The Company is currently undergoing a cost evaluation initiative and 
will incur a restructuring charge of between $125 and $175 million in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. Included in the charge will be charges 
associated with the reduction in the Company's global workforce, lease 
abandonments, asset write-downs and other costs.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

associated with the reduction in the Company's global workforce, lease 
abandonments, asset write-downs and other costs. These measures, combined 
with the Company's efforts to maintain an efficient cost structure in the 
face of a difficult short-term market in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, are 
expected to result in projected reduced spending in excess of $100 
million in fiscal 1999. For the quarter ended February 28, 1998, total revenues decreased $199.7 
million and increased $432.8 million year-to-date. U.S. brand revenues 
decreased 15% and 1% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. U.S. footwear revenue declines were the primary reason, with revenue down 
18% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. The decrease for the quarter 
was due to a 9% decrease in pairs sold and an 11% average reduction in 
selling price. While most core footwear categories experienced decreases 
for the quarter, the three largest category increases were in golf 
(up 117%), soccer (up 80%), and Brand Jordan (up 125%). U.S. apparel 
revenues decreased 5% for the quarter, but increased 10% on a year-to-date 
basis. For the quarter, golf was up 55% while the core apparel categories 
of training and basketball were down 10% and 22%, respectively. Non-U.S. brand revenues decreased 1% for the quarter and increased 
18% year-to-date. Had the dollar remained constant with that of the 
prior year, non-U.S. revenues would have increased 9% for the quarter 
and 29% year-to-date.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

total revenue for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, increased 
5% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Italy, France and Spain all had 
double digit growth in constant dollars. The Asia Pacific region 
decreased 17% for the quarter (down 2% on a constant dollar basis). Footwear revenues in the region were down 26%, while apparel increased 6%. Japan, which a year ago had increased 107% quarter on quarter, had flat 
revenues operationally, and was down 10% including the effect of exchange 
rates. The Americas region, which includes Latin America and Canada, 
increased 27% for the quarter (32% on a constant dollar basis) and both 
footwear and apparel revenues increased to 14% and 72%, respectively. Other and Other Brands, which includes NIKE brand equipment, Bauer Inc., 
Cole Haan, Sports Specialties, and Tetra Plastics, increased 6% to $118.3 
million for the third quarter and 5% to $425.3 million year-to-date. The 
increase was due to NIKE brand equipment partially offset by a decline 
in the Other Brands. The breakdown of revenues follows:",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000006.txt

approximately $23 million in remediation efforts, including the cost of new 
software and modifying the applicable code of existing software. Approximately 
$6.4 million of these expenditures was for new hardware and software, and has 
been capitalized. The remainder has been expensed as incurred. The Company 
estimates total costs related to the year 2000 issue will be in the range of
$45 to $50 million, approximately $10 million of which will be capitalized. The
Company presently believes that the total cost of achieving year 2000 compliant 
systems is not expected to be material to NIKE's financial condition, liquidity,
or results of operations. Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first quarter of fiscal
1999 were $85.6 million, split evenly between the U.S. and non-U.S. operations, compared to $108.7 million for the first three months of fiscal 
1998. Additions in the U.S. were comprised primarily of U.S. headquarters 
expansion, customer service distribution facilities, ongoing investment in 
systems infrastructure, and retail expansion. Outside the U.S., the majority 
of the increase related to expansion of the customer service distribution 
center in Europe and retail expansion in all regions. Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, 
together with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000022.txt

company-wide, resulting in costs to sever employees and related asset write-
downs and lease abandonments related to the affected employees; 2) the 
relocation of, and elimination of, certain job responsibilities of the Asia 
Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong, resulting in reduction in workforce, lease 
abandonments and other costs of downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the 
downsizing of the Company's Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-
down of assets no longer in use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic 
long-term endorsement contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; 
and 5) the decision to exit certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer 
subsidiary, resulting in the reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the 
write-down of assets no longer in use and the estimated loss on divestiture of 
certain manufacturing plants. The Company's gross margin percentage for the first quarter was 37.6%, 
down from 39.8% in the prior year. Margins were adversely affected by 
continued efforts to liquidate the Company's closeout inventories around the 
world, particularly in Asia and in U.S. apparel.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000022.txt

affected by increased sales of lower priced product and the effect of the 
strengthening US dollar, inhibiting the Company's ability to price product 
competitively. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% from last year's 
first quarter, but were up as a percentage of revenues, to 26.1% compared to 
23.8%. While sports marketing expenses increased with significant 
expenditures surrounding the World Cup event in France, wage-related 
expenses were up less than 1% and advertising spending was down, more than 
offsetting the increase in sports marketing expenses. Selling and 
administrative spending reflects management's continuing efforts to control 
expenditures in a changing industry and general economic environment while not 
jeopardizing long-term growth objectives. Selling and administrative expenses 
for the full year are expected to be slightly higher than last year's levels 
as a percentage of revenue. As of August 31, 1998, the Company has purchased a total of 2.5 million 
shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $105.9 million in the open market 
since the $1 billion share repurchase program was approved in December 
1997. During the first quarter, the Company purchased a total of 1.3 million 
shares for $52.0 million. Funding has, and is expected to continue to, come 
from operating cash flow in conjunction with short-term borrowings. The 
timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working

timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working 
capital needs and stock market conditions. As a result, in some cases NIKE will develop contingency plans that 
assume some estimated level of noncompliance by, or business disruption to, 
suppliers and customers. The Company intends to have contingency plans 
developed by mid-1999 for significant suppliers and customers determined to be 
at high risk of noncompliance or business disruption. The contingency plans 
will be developed on a case-by-case basis, and may include booking orders and 
producing products before anticipated business disruptions, manual intervention,
or finding alternative suppliers. Even so, judgments regarding contingency 
plans - such as how to develop them and to what extent - are themselves subject 
to many variables and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that NIKE will 
correctly anticipate the level, impact or duration of noncompliance by suppliers
and customers that provide inadequate information, or that its contingency plans
will be sufficient to mitigate the impact. Thus, some material adverse effect 
to NIKE may result from one or more third parties regardless of defensive 
contingency plans. Interest expense decreased in the first quarter compared to last year 
as less short term debt was needed to finance lower levels of inventories 
and accounts receivable. Other expense also decreased from the prior 
year, mainly due to less foreign currency transaction losses, offset by 
decreased profit sharing expense and lower interest income.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-98-000022.txt

resulting in costs to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease 
abandonments related to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and 
elimination of, certain job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters in 
Hong Kong, resulting in reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and other 
costs of downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the 
Company's Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-down of assets no 
longer in use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term 
endorsement contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; and 5) the 
decision to exit certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer subsidiary, 
resulting in the reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the write-down of 
assets no longer in use and the estimated loss on divestiture of certain 
manufacturing plants. As of November 30, 1998, the Company purchased a total of 6.4 million

the first half of fiscal 1999, the Company purchased a total of 5.2 million 
shares for $198 million. Funding has, and is expected to continue to, come from 
operating cash flow in conjunction with short-term borrowings. The timing and 
the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working capital needs and 
stock market conditions. Costs related to the year 2000 issue are funded through operating cash 
flows. Through the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company expended 
approximately $31 million in remediation efforts, including the cost of new 
software, modifying the applicable code of existing software, and internal 
costs. Approximately $7 million of these expenditures was for new hardware 
and software, and has been capitalized. The remainder has been expensed as 
incurred. As a result, in some cases NIKE will develop contingency plans that 
assume some estimated level of noncompliance by, or business disruption to, 
suppliers and customers. The Company is currently developing those contingency 
plans, with the goal of completing them by mid-1999 for significant suppliers 
and customers determined to be at high risk of noncompliance or business 
disruption. The contingency plans are being developed on a case-by-case basis, 
and may include booking orders and producing products before anticipated 
business disruptions, manual intervention, or finding alternative suppliers. Even so, judgments regarding contingency plans - such as how to develop them and 
to what extent - are themselves subject to many variables and uncertainties.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0000320187-99-000002.txt

be sufficient to mitigate the impact of noncompliance by suppliers and 
customers, and some material adverse effect to NIKE may result from one or more 
third parties regardless of defensive contingency plans. Cash provided by operations increased $382 million compared to the first 
six months of last year. Working capital changes were the main reason for the 
increase, primarily the decrease in accounts receivable, due to lower revenue, 
and the decrease in inventory levels. Consolidated inventory levels at November 
30, 1998 were 17% lower than last November and 14% lower than May 31, 1998. Closeout levels in footwear inventory continued to fall to more normal levels in 
all regions. In apparel, the Company was able to reduce closeout levels in 
every region except Europe. The advancement of the Company's retail strategy 
around the world has helped sell through of closeout product. During the second 
quarter the Company added 13 new outlet locations: 6 in the U.S., 4 in Europe

discounted sales in those regions during the quarter. Selling and administrative expenses have decreased 13% from last year's 
third quarter and 8% year-to-date. Expenses for the quarter are also down as a 
percentage of revenues, and are only up slightly on a year-to-date basis. Reductions in spending came from virtually every area of the Company's 
operations in the Company's continued efforts to better align its cost structure 
with overall revenue levels. The reductions include wage and wage-related 
costs, despite the effects of continued retail outlet store growth around the 
world. No increases to the 1998 restructuring charge were made during the first 
nine months of fiscal 1999. A total of $6.7 million of the restructuring 
accrual was not required due to changes in estimates related to severance 
payments of $1.1 million, a $3.1 million change in estimated vendor software 
costs related to Japan's software development, lease commitments of $1.5 million 
due to earlier sub-leasing than originally anticipated and other changes of $1.0

of anticipated exposures typically twelve months in advance, but has hedged as much as 34 months in advance. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company announced a plan to restructure the organization. As part of this plan, the Company intends to
streamline its management structure and eliminate operational redundancies to enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, on March 16, 2009, the
Company announced that it expects to reduce its global workforce by up to four percent and incur gross restructuring charges of between $175 million and $225 million, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs. The Company

demand, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily driven by an increase in employee compensation payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the

purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Following the completion of this program in September, the Company began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the NIKE, Inc. Board of Directors in
September 2012. As of the end of the third quarter we had repurchased 11.1 million shares at a cost of $548 million under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or
debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_10q\nke\10-Q\0001193125-13-142156.txt
