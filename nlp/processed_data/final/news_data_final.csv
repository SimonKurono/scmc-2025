Nike’s Q1 FY2026 results underscore a company in transition, struggling to find footing amid mounting competitive and operational pressures. While total revenue rose a modest 1% year-over-year to $11.7 billion, the composition of growth revealed deeper issues—North American revenue declined 3%, and Nike Direct sales fell 4%, undermining years of effort to build a high-margin D2C model. Instead, wholesale sales grew 7%, signaling a tactical reversal as Nike leans on retail partners to offset direct-channel weakness. This shift, though necessary in the short term, highlights the strain on Nike’s once-vaunted brand power and consumer connection.
Gross margin deterioration was the most alarming signal, plunging 320 basis points to 42.2% due to elevated product costs, unfavorable currency effects, and widespread discounting to clear excess inventory. The erosion of pricing power underscores the weakening of Nike’s brand premium—a critical concern for a company long defined by its aspirational positioning. Management’s “Win Now” initiative, intended to reignite core categories such as running and basketball, remains in early stages, with little evidence yet of meaningful financial impact.
Regionally, softness in Greater China and continued weakness in North America offset moderate growth in EMEA and APLA. The company’s reluctance to issue guidance reflects uncertainty about the near-term outlook, as inventory challenges, macro headwinds, and rising competition from brands like Hoka and On weigh on visibility. Though Nike’s global scale, supply chain strength, and distribution network remain significant advantages, the quarter revealed a brand in search of renewed identity and strategic clarity. For now, sentiment skews bearish as the company’s transition from stagnation to sustainable growth remains incomplete.

On December 10, Guggenheim began covering NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) with a Buy rating and set a $77 price target. While retail is still widely viewed as “structurally sick,” the firm said the “holiday brought the cheer.” It added that tariffs have been manageable so far and pointed to what it called “most importantly and likely going unnoticed,” noting that most of the companies it covers are operating at, or very near, peak gross margins.
In separate news, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and LSU announced on December 11 that they are extending their partnership, a relationship that has been in place for more than 50 years. The new agreement runs through 2036 and opens the door to a fresh chapter of athlete-first innovation and closer collaboration in Baton Rouge. It also reinforces the deep ties between Nike and LSU, a program that has long been at the center of elite collegiate competition.
Alongside the extension, Nike is launching Nike Blue Ribbon Elite. It is a first-of-its-kind program aimed at reshaping the NIL space through deeper, more direct collaboration with athletes and schools, starting with LSU. The move reflects the company’s long-standing identity as a brand built for athletes and underscores its ongoing focus on inspiring and supporting the next generation through partnerships, innovation, and storytelling that help expand sport worldwide.

Nike Inc. jumped by 4.64 percent on Wednesday to close at $60 apiece after an Apple executive nearly doubled his stake in the company.
In a regulatory filing, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) said that Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., acquired $2.9 million worth of new shares in the company.
Cook is currently an independent director and now owns a little more than 105,000 shares in Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE).
The purchase reflected strong confidence in the stock, despite posting dismal earnings performance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and posting lower sales guidance for the next quarter.
In the second quarter, the athletic fashion maker said that net income declined by 32 percent to $792 million from $1.16 billion in the same period last year.
Revenues were flat at $12 billion due to sales declines in China, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, which were primarily offset by growth in the North American region.
Regions with a high quality of life, including safety and healthcare, often become a magnet for new residents.
Looking ahead, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) expects revenues for the third quarter to drop by low single digits, falling below analyst expectations of modest growth, on expectations that its operations in China, alongside higher tariffs, would continue to dampen sales.

Should You Buy the Dip?,0,,,"Nike (NKE) shares crashed over 10% on Dec. 19 after the footwear giant reported market-beating financials for its Q2 but issued disappointing guidance for the future.
The Beaverton-headquartered firm now sees its sales declining by a low single digit percentage and gross margins coming in down about 200 basis points in the fiscal third quarter.
Investors punished NKE shares also because the company’s revenue in Greater China – one of its major global markets – tanked another 17% in the recently concluded quarter.
Together, these weaknesses made them question if CEO Elliott Hill’s turnaround plan will succeed in helping Nike reclaim its glory. Versus its August high, Nike stock is now down about 30%.
How to Play Nike Stock on Post-Earnings Plunge
The post-earnings decline even pushed NKE stock below its 50-day moving average (MA) – a technical setup that’s often interpreted as a bearish signal for the near term.
Still, Kevin McCarthy – a senior research analyst with Neuberger Berman – says “I’d be a buyer on a day like this” mostly because the management told shareholders upfront that it won’t be a linear recovery.
Nike’s second quarter release had enough “redeeming qualities” to continue believing in its long-term earnings power.
Speaking with CNBC, McCarthy refrained from putting a price target on NKE, but said the stock will likely emerge an “alpha generative investment over the next couple of years.”
Why NKE Shares Are Worth Owning for 2026
Kevin McCarthy remains positive on Nike shares also because the firm’s gross margins excluding the impact of tariffs were actually up on a year-over-year basis in Q2.
On “Squawk Box,” the analyst expressed confidence in Hill’s leadership, saying “he knows what he needs to be doing.”
According to him, NKE has cleaned its U.S. inventories where its order book is improving already, and the stock will push higher as the management replicates this progress in markets outside of its hometown as well.
A healthy 2.84% dividend yield makes up for another great reason to have Nike in your investment portfolio heading into 2026.
Nike Hasn’t Fallen Out of Favor With Wall Street
Wall Street more broadly remains constructive on Nike stock for the coming year as well.
The consensus rating on NKE shares remains at “Moderate Buy” with the mean target of about $80 indicating potential upside of roughly 40% from here.

With news that the company is dramatically reshuffling its C-suite under CEO Elliott Hill’s “Win Now” plan, senior leaders are being replaced, new roles created, and decision-making streamlined as the brand pivots toward speed, efficiency, and digital-first execution.
Nike is restructuring its senior leadership team as part of its turnaround strategy, aiming to cut unnecessary management layers, strengthen consumer connections, and accelerate its “sport offense.” At the heart of the shake-up, longtime supply-chain head Venkatesh Alagirisamy is elevated to a newly minted Chief Operating Officer role, while absorbing not just logistics and manufacturing, but also technology leadership. As a result, Nike has eliminated the Chief Technology Officer position, leading to the departure of Dr. Muge Dogan.
In a broader shift, the heads of Nike’s four major geographies: Greater China, EMEA, North America, and APLA, will now join the senior leadership team and report directly to CEO Elliott Hill. The company is also removing the Chief Commercial Officer role, while Global Sales and Nike Direct will now report to CFO Matt Friend, positioning him to closely align marketplace strategy with Nike’s broader priorities.
In light of these sweeping changes, is now the time to buy, sell, or hold NKE stock?
About NIKE Stock
Headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, Nike is a leading global designer, marketer, and retailer of athletic footwear, apparel, sports equipment and accessories. Known worldwide for its iconic Swoosh logo and brands such as Nike, Air Jordan, and Converse, Nike serves a broad base of athletes, sports enthusiasts, and casual consumers across countries through its own stores, wholesale partners, and e-commerce platforms. Nike’s market cap stands around $97.1 billion.
Nike has experienced a turbulent stock performance over the past year, marked by sharp swings and a broader downtrend as the company works through a pivotal turnaround. After hitting a 52-week high of $82.44 in February, the stock has faced a pullback of 20.3% from that high, closing the last session at $65.82. The stock has slumped 16.2% over the past year and 13% year-to-date (YTD), underperforming the broader market and reflecting the brand’s ongoing challenges.
Much of the volatility stems from the interplay between internal restructuring and external economic pressures. Under CEO Elliott Hill, Nike has embarked on an aggressive “Win Now” turnaround that aims to rebuild its wholesale business, reignite innovation, and correct past missteps in its direct-to-consumer strategy. Investors have shown guarded confidence as early signs of progress emerge, with occasional rallies punctuating an otherwise difficult year.
Still, several headwinds continue to weigh on the stock. A slowdown in fresh, compelling product releases has opened the door for rivals. High inventory levels, especially have forced Nike into discounting, pressuring margins already strained by tariffs and cost pressures. Meanwhile, weak consumer sentiment in China and broader macroeconomic uncertainty have dampened demand across key regions.
However, the stock is trading at a premium compared to industry peers at 40.03 times forward earnings.
Mixed Q1 Results
NIKE reported its fiscal first quarter (Q1 FY2026) results on Sept. 30, covering the period ended Aug. 31. Revenue came in at $11.7 billion, just a 1% increase from the prior-year quarter.
The company saw a 7% rise in wholesale revenue, which reached $6.8 billion, while Nike Direct revenues came in at $4.5 billion, down 4% year-over-year (YOY). Also, revenues for Converse stood at $366 million, down 27%. Inventories stood at $8.1 billion, down 2% compared to the same period the prior year.
Profitability took a hit. Gross margin shrank by 320 basis points to 42.2%, reflecting a mix of higher discounts, increased product costs (including tariffs, particularly in North America), and an unfavorable shift in channel mix. As a result, net income fell about 31% to $0.7 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) dropped 30% YOY to $0.49, but exceeded expectations.
On the geographic front, growth was uneven. North America delivered modest gains of 4% in revenues driven by apparel, equipment, and a rebound in demand for running, training, and basketball categories, while the wholesale channel gained traction. But markets like Greater China continued to underperform with nearly a 9% decline, weighing on overall results.
Further, management signaled cautious optimism. The company emphasized that although wholesale and certain geographies are showing signs of recovery under its “Win Now” turnaround plan, progress will not be exactly linear. The company expects Q2 revenues to be down low single digits and gross margins to be down 300 to 375 basis points.
Analysts predict EPS to be around $1.65 for fiscal 2026, down 23.6% YOY, before surging by 56.36% annually to $2.58 in fiscal 2027.
What Do Analysts Expect for Nike Stock?
Recently, RBC Capital reaffirmed its “Outperform” rating and $85 price target on Nike, pointing to continued progress in cleaning up excess inventory, a key factor in the firm’s confidence that the company will enter 2026 in a stronger operational position.
Analyst Piral Dadhania noted that Nike appears to be nearing the end of its intensive inventory reset and is unlikely to deliver any major surprises in its upcoming Q2 results. RBC also expects Nike’s fiscal Q3 2026 outlook to signal stabilizing revenue and earnings trends, a shift investors would likely welcome. The firm additionally highlighted Nike’s product pipeline, including the 2026 Football World Cup kits, refreshed footwear lines, and new Basketball releases scheduled for early 2026.
Overall, NKE has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating. Of the 35 analysts covering the stock, 17 advise a “Strong Buy,” four suggest a “Moderate Buy,” 12 analysts are on the sidelines, giving it a “Hold” rating, and two recommend a “Strong Sell.”
The average analyst price target for NKE is $82.76, indicating a potential upside of 25.5%. The Street-high target price of $120 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 82.2%.

Of course, you got to ask yourself if the move is sustainable. I don’t know. Tonight, Nike looks terrible, but that could be, a lot of that is China.

NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an athletic and casual footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories company that sells its products under brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse. During the December 12 episode, Cramer said that he is worried about the company’s “old inventory,” as he remarked:
“Next up, I like Thursday… After the close is the biggest night of the week when CNBC Investing Club position, Nike reports, and FedEx also issues its quarterly numbers. Now, I told people listening to the club call today that I think it’s still too soon to make a big swing at Nike. I’m not doing that yet because the company was so messed up, much more than we thought before Elliott Hill came in, the new CEO, that was a year ago. But it’s been that tough to turn around. I do like that we have the World Cup next year. A good showcase ahead. But it’s the old inventory that I worry about.”

After NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s second fiscal quarter earnings release on December 18th, multiple analysts came out with reports for the firm. For instance, Truist cut the share price target to $70 from $85 on December 19th as it kept a Buy rating on the shares. The firm explained that while NIKE, Inc.

(NYSE:NKE)’s $12.43 billion in revenue and $0.53 in earnings beat analyst estimates of $12.22 billion and $0.38.

For instance, UBS cut the share price target to $62 from $71 on December 19th and kept a Neutral rating. The bank explained that while NIKE, Inc.

The tech weakness came despite the Federal Reserve delivering an expected rate cut Wednesday, with Chair Powell's cautious 2026 guidance and higher dot plot projections overshadowing near-term accommodation.
This week delivers a concentration of economic data with Tuesday's explosive convergence of the November jobs report, retail sales, and dual PMI releases all at 8:30am and 9:45am, followed by Thursday's CPI inflation report that will test whether price pressures are finally moderating or remaining stubbornly elevated.
The earnings calendar features semiconductor bellwether Micron (MU) Wednesday providing insights into memory chip demand, followed by Thursday's diverse lineup including FedEx (FDX), Nike (NKE), and Accenture (ACN) testing logistics, consumer discretionary, and professional services sectors. Friday's Core PCE Price Index represents the Fed's preferred inflation measure and will provide final perspective on price trends as markets head into the year-end holiday period.
Here are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.
Tuesday's Economic Data Explosion
Tuesday delivers an unprecedented convergence of major economic releases packed into a two-hour window that could significantly influence year-end market direction. The November jobs report at 8:30am will provide comprehensive employment insights including nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rate, and wage growth trends that determine consumer spending capacity heading into 2026. Strong employment data could validate the Fed's cautious stance from last week's meeting, while weakness could raise concerns about economic momentum and complicate the more hawkish 2026 projections. Simultaneously, October retail sales data will offer critical insights into consumer spending resilience during the crucial holiday shopping season, with both headline and core readings analyzed for evidence of household demand strength. The 9:45am Manufacturing and Services PMI releases will provide forward-looking perspectives on business activity across both goods-producing and services sectors. The compressed timing creates potential for significant volatility as markets digest employment, consumption, and business activity data essentially simultaneously. Any major surprises across these reports could trigger substantial moves in rate-sensitive sectors and influence year-end positioning decisions.
November CPI: Inflation's Stubborn Reality
Thursday's November CPI report at 8:30am represents one of the most critical inflation releases of the year, providing crucial evidence about whether price pressures are finally moderating or remaining persistently elevated in ways that could complicate the Fed's policy path. Both headline and core CPI readings will be scrutinized for any signs of reacceleration that could validate the Fed's more cautious 2026 outlook delivered at last week's meeting. Energy prices, housing costs, and services inflation will be key components to watch, particularly given their outsized influence on overall price trends and consumer purchasing power. The report comes just days after the Fed's decision and Powell's acknowledgment that inflation progress has slowed, making any upside surprise particularly problematic for dovish expectations. Strong CPI readings could reinforce concerns that the Fed may pause its cutting cycle earlier than markets previously anticipated, while benign data could provide relief and support risk assets heading into year-end. Thursday's Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index will provide additional economic context about regional industrial conditions and pricing pressures.
Micron's Memory Chip Demand Reality Check
Wednesday's Micron (MU) earnings arrive at a critical juncture following Friday's tech selloff that saw AI infrastructure stocks plunge on concerns about return on investment and spending sustainability. Micron's results will provide crucial insights into memory chip demand across data centers, smartphones, PCs, and automotive applications, with high-bandwidth memory for AI accelerators representing the company's key growth driver. The earnings take on heightened significance after Oracle and Broadcom's disappointing reactions raised questions about whether AI infrastructure investment can sustain current momentum into 2026. Micron's commentary about HBM supply allocation to AI chip manufacturers, DRAM pricing trends, and inventory levels throughout the supply chain will be closely watched for any signs of demand softening or pricing pressure. The company's guidance about calendar 2026 demand patterns and capital expenditure plans will help determine whether the semiconductor industry can maintain optimistic growth assumptions or if a cyclical downturn is emerging. Given the fragile sentiment in technology stocks, Micron's results could either stabilize the sector or accelerate concerns about AI spending deceleration.
Consumer and Logistics Health Assessment
Thursday's earnings from FedEx (FDX), Nike (NKE), and Accenture (ACN) will provide diverse perspectives on global logistics, consumer discretionary spending, and professional services demand heading into year-end. FedEx results will offer critical insights into package volumes, e-commerce trends, and business shipping activity that serve as leading indicators for economic health. The company's commentary about holiday season shipping volumes, international trade flows, and pricing power will be particularly important given ongoing questions about global economic momentum. Nike's earnings will test athletic apparel demand, international market performance particularly in China, and inventory management amid shifting consumer preferences and competitive pressures. Accenture's results will provide comprehensive perspectives on corporate consulting demand, IT services spending, and digital transformation project budgets that indicate business confidence and investment intentions. The convergence of these reports with Thursday's CPI data creates potential for significant sector rotation if earnings and inflation data collectively suggest strengthening or weakening economic fundamentals.
Dual Inflation Measures and Housing Market Context
Friday's Core PCE Price Index at 8:30am represents the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and will provide final perspectives on October price trends following Thursday's CPI release. The PCE report often shows different inflation readings than CPI due to methodological differences, making both month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons with CPI particularly important for understanding the complete inflation picture. The timing coming one day after CPI creates potential for either confirming or contradicting Thursday's inflation narrative, with significant implications for rate-sensitive sectors heading into the year-end period. Friday's existing home sales data at 10:00am will offer insights into residential real estate activity amid elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges. The housing market data will help assess whether recent Fed rate cuts are beginning to stimulate housing activity or if structural affordability issues continue constraining demand. The combination of dual inflation readings across Tuesday's retail sales, Thursday's CPI, and Friday's PCE creates a comprehensive assessment of price pressures and consumer spending patterns that will significantly influence early 2026 market expectations and Fed policy assumptions.

Analysts predict NIKE to report an adjusted EPS of $0.37, down 52.6% from $0.78 in the year-ago quarter. However, it has surpassed Wall Street's earnings estimates in the last four quarters.
For fiscal 2026, analysts forecast NIKE to report an adjusted EPS of $1.67, a decline of 23.6% from $2.16 in fiscal 2025. Nevertheless, adjusted EPS is anticipated to surge 55.8% year-over-year to $2.57 in fiscal 2027.
Shares of NIKE have dropped 13.8% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) nearly 12% return and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLY) 2.1% rise over the period.
Shares of Nike climbed 6.4% following its Q1 2026 results on Sept. 30 as overall revenue of $11.7 billion rose 1% year-over-year, while footwear sales of $7.4 billion topped the consensus estimate. Investor sentiment was further lifted by strong apparel growth of 9% to $3.3 billion, well above the consensus, and wholesale revenue growth of 7%, which helped offset weaker Nike Direct sales. Additionally, gross margin of 42.2% exceeded expectations, easing concerns about discounting and tariff pressures even as net income fell 31% to $727 million.
Analysts' consensus view on NKE stock is cautiously optimistic, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating overall. Among 35 analysts covering the stock, 17 recommend ""Strong Buy,"" four give ""Moderate Buy,"" 12 indicate “Hold,” and two advise ""Strong Sell."" The average analyst price target for NIKE is $82.04, suggesting a potential upside of 24.2% from current levels.

The Reason? Apple CEO Tim Cook By Aaron Rennie Full Bio A former Senior Publishing Editor on the Dow Jones Newswires team at The Wall Street Journal, Aaron earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Michigan and a Master's in Journalism from Columbia University. Learn about our editorial policies Published December 24, 2025 Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, is also a member of Nike's board. Unique Nicole / WireImage Close Key Takeaways Shares of Nike rose Wednesday, helped by news of a buy from Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of the company's board.Cook bought at average prices near $59, well below Wall Street analysts' consensus price target around $80. A vote of confidence from the leader of one big brand is helping the shares of another today. Shares of Nike (NKE) climbed on Wednesday's holiday-shortened trading session—the shares were recently up about 4.5%, leading all gainers on the S&P 500—following an expression of support from Apple CEO Tim Cook. Why This Matters to Investors As a general rule, investors sell shares when they think they have better uses for the money—and those reasons can be hard to divine. The other side of that coin is that investors only buy shares when they think they're poised to rise. That's why watching the trades of people associated with a particular company is part of many investors' strategies. A regulatory filing revealed that Cook, a member of Nike's board for two decades, bought nearly $3 million worth of Nike stock on Monday, acquiring 50,000 shares—a rough doubling of his stake—at a weighted average price of $58.97, not far off Friday's close. Even with today's surge, Nike shares have lost about 20% of their value this year. The company is about a year into a turnaround launched by CEO Elliot Hill, and while management believes it's made substantial progress investors are still wary.

The announcement comes at a time when the company is working through a multi-year effort to revive growth and streamline its operations. While these initiatives are beginning to show early signs of progress, Nike stock has remained under pressure as investors remain cautious.
Nike shares have lagged broader equity markets this year, down 11% year to date. Demand conditions remain challenging in some of the company’s most important regions, particularly North America and China, where consumer spending and competitive pressures have kept growth subdued. These headwinds continue to weigh on sentiment, even as management pushes forward with strategic adjustments.
Despite the stock’s weakness, Nike’s earnings history offers a different picture. Over the past four quarters, Nike shares have risen following earnings announcements in three instances, suggesting that expectations may often be set conservatively going into results. This dynamic makes the upcoming report especially relevant for short-term traders.
Meanwhile, the options market indicates that investors are bracing for a notable move in Nike stock after the earnings release. Based on current contracts expiring Dec. 26, traders are implying a post-earnings move of about 7.4% in either direction. This is modestly higher than Nike’s average post-earnings move of approximately 6.8% over the past four quarters, signaling elevated uncertainty around the near-term outlook.
Nike Q2: Here’s What to Expect
Revenue is likely to remain under pressure, while margins and earnings could continue to face headwinds, despite encouraging signs in certain parts of the business.
Management has guided for Q2 revenue to decline in the low single digits, a forecast that includes a modest 1% benefit from foreign exchange. At first glance, this outlook may appear conservative. Nike’s wholesale business has been showing improving momentum, supported by deliberate efforts to broaden distribution and reach new consumer segments. These strategic initiatives are beginning to show results and could help offset some of the overall softness. However, difficult year-over-year comparisons could remain a drag.
The digital channel is expected to be a more meaningful drag on performance in the quarter. Following the holiday season last year, Nike began implementing its “Win Now” actions, which included a significant reduction in promotional intensity. While this shift is aimed at protecting brand strength and long-term profitability, it creates a tougher comparison for NIKE Digital in Q2, where lower promotional activity is weighing on near-term sales.
Regionally, North America continues to show signs of building momentum. Sustained brand activity across key sports categories, combined with Nike’s sports marketing portfolio, is helping support demand. Greater China remains more challenging. Store traffic there is likely to stay under pressure, even though certain categories are performing well. Running has emerged as a bright spot, delivering high single-digit growth during the last reported quarter. Even so, overall marketplace traffic remains weak across both Nike-owned and partner stores. Digital sales in China also remain highly promotional, with consumers taking longer to make purchases and demanding deeper discounts on local platforms.
From a profitability standpoint, the outlook remains cautious. Margin pressure is expected to persist due to higher wholesale discounts, increased product costs, the impact of new tariffs, and unfavorable channel-mix dynamics.
Against this backdrop, analysts are forecasting a notable decline in earnings for the quarter. Consensus expectations call for earnings of $0.37 per share, representing a year-over-year decline of more than 52.6%. That said, Nike has a recent track record of outperforming expectations. The company has delivered earnings beats in each of the past four quarters, including a particularly strong upside surprise of 81.5% in the last reported quarter.
The Bottom Line
Nike’s near-term fundamentals remain challenged, particularly in revenue growth, digital demand, and margins. However, early signs of stabilization in wholesale, improving momentum in North America, and category-level strength in areas such as running suggest that Nike’s strategic reset is beginning to gain traction, but unevenly across regions and channels.
Despite near-term challenges, Nike stock carries a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating, reflecting analysts’ confidence in Nike’s brand strength. However, investors should exercise caution, as Nike’s second-quarter earnings report is likely to face meaningful headwinds.

- With shares down significantly and dividends rising, Nike's yield has doubled over the past several years.
- Pulte is outperforming its industry by a wide margin in 2025 and just announced a sizable dividend increase.
- Tariffs are weighing down MCK, but the stock's dividend yield is approaching 3% after receiving a solid boost.
Three major players across apparel, homebuilding, and consumer staples have announced increases to their quarterly dividends. Leveraging their strong industry positions, each company is taking steps to return more capital to shareholders.
NKE’s Yield Steps Up to 2.5% as Shares Decline
First up is the most valuable U.S. stock in the textiles, apparel, and luxury goods industry: Nike (NYSE: NKE). With a market capitalization of over $95 billion, Nike is larger than the combined market capitalizations of the next four largest U.S. stocks in this industry. On a global scale, Nike is the fifth-largest name in this space, demonstrating the significant role that European companies play.
Nike has certainly lost a lot of its shine over the past three years, with shares down around 39%. However, one silver lining to this is the upward pressure that a falling share price puts on a company’s dividend yield. After its latest dividend increase, announced on Nov. 20, Nike’s indicated dividend yield sits above 2.5%. That’s approximately double where this figure stood three years ago.
Nike’s quarterly dividend will rise by 3% to 41 cents per share. This new amount is payable on Jan. 2, 2026, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 1. Investors who miss this window can very likely receive the payout in future quarters. Over the last 24 years, Nike has only raised its dividend.
PHM: Outperforming Homebuilder Boosts Dividend 18%
PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM) is the third most valuable homebuilding stock in the United States. This ranking holds even when looking across the whole world, as there are relatively few large international homebuilding stocks. Amid an unimpressive year for many homebuilders, Pulte has risen above the pack. The stock has delivered a total return of more than 17%, handily beating the 5% return of the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA: XHB).
Benefiting PulteGroup is its strategy to remain firm on home prices. For example, last quarter, the average selling price of a PulteGroup home rose 3%. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton saw its average selling price fall by 3%. This allowed Pulte to maintain the highest gross margin in its industry of 26.4%. For comparison, D.R. Horton’s gross margin was 20.8% last quarter.
On Nov. 19, Pulte announced a very significant 18% increase to its quarterly dividend. Its new 26-cent-per-share dividend is payable on Jan. 6, 2026, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16. This gives Pulte an indicated dividend yield of approximately 0.8%. Although this figure is relatively low, it is encouraging to see that the firm is taking steps to return more capital to shareholders through its large dividend increase.
MKC Raises Dividend as It Feels the Tariff Heat
McCormick & Company (NYSE: MKC) is one of the top ten most valuable U.S. stocks in the food products industry. It also ranks in the top 25 globally. Shares have delivered a total return of around -10% in 2025, with sales growing in the range of 0% to 3% for the year. Tariffs have not been kind to the spice maker, which imports many of its raw products.
Last quarter, the company raised its gross tariff impact forecast by 55% to $140 million. However, it does expect to offset half of this through mitigation efforts. General increases in commodity prices are also having a negative impact.
Despite going through a difficult period, the company announced a 6.7% increase in its quarterly dividend on Nov. 18. Its new dividend of 48 cents per share is payable on Jan. 12, 2026, to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The stock now holds a strong indicated dividend yield of approximately 2.8%. This significantly exceeds the less than 1.1% indicated yield offered by the S&P 500 Index.
PHM: Dividend and Rate-Cut Probability on the Rise
Overall, NKE, PHM, and MKC are all making strides to increase the amount of income they provide to shareholders. Pulte stands out, with the stock delivering outsized returns compared to its industry and providing the largest dividend increase on this list. It will be interesting to see if the company’s margin-over-growth strategy continues to pay off.
The potential for lower interest rates is one factor aiding home builders. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is currently an 87% chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December, up from just 30% on Nov. 19.

bfb8ae23f02c251dd9c4ae9d449d348b,NKE,,2025-12-24T13:45:02Z,news,news_article,,news,Should You Buy the Dip in Nike Stock for 2026?,0,,,"Nike’s iconic swoosh is limping into 2026. Their Q4 CY2025 revenue came in at $12.43 billion, topping forecasts even though sales were flat from a year earlier. That “beat-without-growth” pattern is showing up across footwear as demand cools and classic styles lose momentum.
Nike’s bigger headache right now is China, where weaker demand is colliding with tariff-driven cost pressure. This has translated directly into pressure on the share price, not just the headlines, as the stock has been repriced lower to reflect slower growth and tighter profitability.
With shares hovering in the high‑$50s and 2026 rapidly approaching, a crucial question hangs over the swoosh. Is Nike’s pullback a rare chance to buy a blue‑chip leader at a discount, or a value trap in the making for the year ahead? Let’s find out.
Nike’s Premium Numbers
Nike (NKE) designs, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment worldwide from its base in Beaverton, Oregon, and carries a market value of about $84.6B. Their capital‑return profile includes a forward annual dividend of $1.64 per share, which equates to a cash yield of roughly 2.79% for shareholders at today’s levels.
NKE is trading at $57.34 as of Dec. 23, down 24.22% year-to-date (YTD) and 25.3% over the past 52 weeks, keeping the stock firmly in “dip” territory for 2026‑focused investors.
This pricing still reflects expectations for a recovery rather than a broken story. It trades at a forward P/E of 36.75x versus a sector median of 19.90x, signaling that the market continues to assign Nike a clear premium on earnings power and growth, even after the recent slide.
Their recent earnings snapshot, for the quarter ending November 2025, helps explain why the market has not fully abandoned that stance while still punishing the stock. This report showed EPS of $0.53 against a $0.37 estimate, a $0.16 beat that translated into a 43.24% positive surprise and reinforced that execution remains stronger than headlines around China softness and tariffs might suggest.
It also detailed Q4 CY2025 revenue of $12.43 billion versus a $12.22 billion consensus, a 1.7% beat that still left sales essentially flat year on year and highlighted how growth has cooled even as guidance continues to clear a lowered bar. The release noted adjusted EBITDA of $1.19B versus expectations of $917.3 million, implying a 9.6% margin and roughly a 30% beat; this shows that Nike is still finding efficiencies and protecting profitability where it can while the top line pauses.
That same update confirmed the operating margin slipped to 8.1% from 11.2% a year ago, and constant‑currency revenue was flat after a prior 9% decline. Meanwhile, same‑store sales fell 3% versus a 2% drop in the comparable period, reminding investors that the current dip in the share price reflects real pressure on demand and margins.
What’s Really Changing for Nike
Nike just caught a break on one of the biggest swing factors for its cost base, and it came from Vietnam rather than China. The company sources roughly half of its footwear from Vietnam. So the new U.S.–Vietnam trade agreement announced earlier in July is a big deal for its evolving 2026 earnings story.
President Donald Trump signed off on a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese imports, a number that matters because it replaces an initially threatened 46% rate and is also below market fears of a 25%–30% range. This outcome does not remove tariff pressure, but it sharply narrows the downside and gives Nike clearer visibility as it works through inventory, pricing, and margin decisions into next year.
Additionally, Nike is moving aggressively on the internal side of the turnaround with notable senior leadership changes that tie directly into its “Win Now” plan. The company created a new EVP, Chief Operating Officer role for Venkatesh Alagirisamy (“Venky”), elevating the long‑time executive who previously served as Chief Supply Chain Officer to oversee Technology along with Supply Chain, Planning, Operations, Manufacturing, and Sustainability. This consolidation aims to integrate better end‑to‑end technology across Nike's creation, production, and delivery of its products.
What Wall Street Expects From Nike in 2026
The next earnings release is set for March 19th, and expectations already show how tough the near-term setup looks. For the current quarter ending February 2026, the average EPS estimate is $0.37 versus $0.54 a year ago, implying -31.48% year-over-year (YOY) growth.
Looking out to the full fiscal year ending 05/2026, the average EPS estimate is $1.60 versus $2.16 in the prior year, a projected -25.9% YOY decline. Those numbers explain the reason the market has been quick to punish the stock after headlines around China's demand and tariff pressure.
However, Wall Street still isn’t treating Nike like a broken brand.
The current consensus sits at “Moderate Buy” based on 35 analysts, of which 17 list it as a “Strong Buy,” four as a “Moderate Buy,” 12 as a “Hold,” and two as a “Strong Sell.” The average 12‑month price target stands at $77.51, implying a roughly 35.18% upside from here. And with the Street's high target of $120, the stock could soar 109.28%.
Conclusion
Long-term investors still get a “yes, but know what you’re buying” dip here. Nike is a premium brand with real earnings pressure now, yet the balance of evidence points to slow repair, not structural collapse. The odds favor a choppy recovery over the next 12–24 months rather than a sustained leg lower from here. Traders may want to treat it as a buy on weakness, not something to chase on strength.

Learn about our editorial policies Published December 19, 2025 02:55 PM EST Nike says its business is midway through a turnaround. Cheng Xin/Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Nike shares, which are down 10% today, are stuck below the prices that predated Elliott Hill's days as CEO.Investors initially welcomed the news that Hill would return to Nike. Today's drop indicates that they're looking for more before declaring the turnaround a success. Nike hoped a new CEO could get its stock rising again. So far, the change just hasn't done it. Shares of Nike (NKE) have fallen some 20% since the beleaguered athleticwear-and-gear company said it would bring back legendary leader Elliott Hill—counted since their close the night before the announcement—in September 2024. More than a year later, it's unclear when the slide will stop. Nike says the business is midway through a turnaround. This message is largely resonating with analysts, but Friday’s 10% drop in stock prices shows that investors may not be as convinced that a comeback is just around the corner. Why This News Matters to Investors Nike's efforts to improve ""brand equity"" and drive full-price sales come at a time when consumers are particularly price-sensitive. The company is pulling back on promotions while retailers and restaurants report that even high-income households are curtailing their spending. Nike reported a “mixed bag” of results Thursday after what was “very much a ‘show me’ quarter,” said David Bartosiak, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. Nike’s second-quarter numbers beat analysts’ expectations, but highlighted several challenges facing the company. Revenue rose 1% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, but profit declined 32% to $792 million. The company is contending with slow sales in China and roughly $1.5 billion in annual costs stemming from tariffs. “This was not a ‘clean’ quarter,” Bartosiak said. Hill said Thursday that he is confident Nike is headed in the right direction, but it is being nuanced about adapting its approach in some 190 countries. “It's just going to take time,"" Hill said on a conference call Thursday, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. ""So I will just sort of point to the place we focus first, which is North America, and we're having great success there.” Related Education What Is a Tariff and Why Are They Important? How Are Earnings and Income Different? Revenue rose 9% year-over-year in North America, with sales to wholesalers—a company priority—growing 24%, Hill said. Investors may be spooked about consumers spending 10% less at Nike’s website and stores, but Bank of America suggested this was a reaction to the company cutting promotions and focusing on full-price sales. “We view this quarter's results as a successful execution of this strategy,” Bank of America said. Investors may be less optimistic about Nike's latest numbers, but they contained “redeeming” data points, Kevin McCarthy, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said on CNBC. Profit margins would have grown, he said, if not for tariffs. “I’d be a buyer on a day like today,” Berman said. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way up with a gain of 1.4%, pushed north by a strong earnings report from Micron (MU), which saw its shares rise 10%. The tech gain came after AI trade worries had spurred another bruising session for tech on Wednesday.
Shares in the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose around 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively.
Headlining the morning was a cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed inflation rose 2.7% in November over the prior year and 2.6% on a ""core"" basis — both figures coming in below economist estimates of 3% and 3.1%, respectively.
On the jobs front, the Department of Labor reported initial jobless claims of 224,000 for the week ended Dec. 13, down 13,000 from the previous week's figure. But that data has also been subject to significant volatility in the wake of the federal shutdown.
Elsewhere, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT, DJTWW) agreed to a $6 billion deal to merge with Tae Technologies, a fusion power group backed by Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Chevron (CVX). Shares in Trump Media, the home of the Truth Social platform, surged after the announcement, seen as a bet on AI-fueled energy demand.

Stocks jump as Micron earnings put AI trade back on track
Stocks jumped on Thursday as Micron Technology's (MU) earnings put the AI trade back on track, and cooler-than-expected inflation raised the odds of more dovish Federal Reserve policy next year.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 1.3%, recovering from losses on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8% while the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up by about 0.1%.
Micron results came in well above expectations, showing data center demand for memory chips is strong. The company's production for next year is already 100% allocated, lifting optimism that the AI trade is far from over.
Stocks also rose after the latest reading on consumer prices for November came in cooler than expected, although October's data was not collected due to the government shutdown.
Economists expect the Fed could lean toward more cuts in 2026 if inflation is kept under control.

Trump Media & Technology Group extends gains to 44%
The deal underscores a bet on the energy demands from AI and data centers and the technologies that could prevail. TAE's backers include tech giant Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Goldman Sachs (GS), and oil major Chevron (CVX).
Cannabis stocks jump as Trump signs order aimed at easing restrictions on industry
Cannabis-related stocks jumped on Thursday after President Trump signed an executive action aimed at reclassifying cannabis under federal law, a move expected to bring major changes to its regulation and economic impact.
Tilray (TLRY) jumped 2%, while Canopy Growth (CGC) jumped 6%.
The directive calls on the Department of Justice to initiate the process of transferring cannabis to a classification applied to substances that have acknowledged medical benefits and a comparatively lower risk of misuse.
The shift could pave the way for expanded scientific study and the approval of cannabis-related treatments by the FDA, while also easing financial and regulatory pressures on businesses operating in the cannabis sector.

Hut 8 CEO says $7 billion data center deal with Google is 'first domino to fall'
Hut 8 (HUT) is the latest crypto miner pivoting to power AI compute.
In a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) that was backstopped by Google (GOOG). The stock fell 2% on Thursday following a 20% gain the day before.
Micron (MU) powered tech stocks higher on Thursday after the company's quarterly results showed that AI-linked demand for high-bandwidth memory chips boosted revenue.
Micron shares rose 12% as of midday, lifting the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 1.6%. Stocks in the semiconductor and software infrastructure industries added over 2%, including a roughly 2.5% gain in Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD).
The upswing came after Micron's first quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported, as revenue from Micron's storage chips for data centers surpassed $1 billion for the first time.
""On any dip, this is an extraordinary opportunity because this is an industry that is an oligopoly,"" Freedom Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance, referring to the DRAM market. ""Micron and two South Korean players [Samsung & SK Hynix] control about 90% of the share.""

'Absence of data' in CPI report flashes yellow for further interest rate cuts
UBS: AI story remains intact, could reach $3 trillion in revenue potential by 2030
As momentum behind the AI trade returns to US markets, UBS said there's more room to run.
""Without taking any single-stock views, we believe the overall AI story remains intact,"" UBS Global Wealth Management's Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi wrote in a note to clients. ""Demand for AI compute remains strong, and we estimate that the required compute capacity in the coming years could be orders of magnitude greater than today’s installed base.""
Wednesday's trading session showed that fears about an AI bubble persist, however, as tech stocks led the markets lower after a report from the Financial Times said Oracle's partner Blue Owl Capital would not back its $10 billion data center.
But UBS's Hoffmann-Burchardi doesn't share those concerns. ""We do not see evidence of an investment bubble, with company fundamentals in aggregate still robust,"" Hoffmann-Burchardi said Thursday morning.
He believes the market could see tremendous growth from here.
""We expect the total addressable market for AI to reach $3.1 trillion in revenue potential by 2030 — a 30% compound annual growth rate over the next five years,"" he wrote.
Adding to a positive string of outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into next year, UBS predicts the S&P 500 could reach 7,300 by June next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026, boosted by earnings growth of 10%, looser Fed policy, and the broadening of AI adoption.
""We believe the structural trends of electrification and longevity will also drive equity performance for the long term,"" the firm wrote in its note.

BP shares sink on news of surprise CEO change
Shares in British energy major BP plc (BP) shed roughly 2.2% in early trading on Thursday as investors digested the news from Wednesday night that Meg O'Neill, the CEO of Australian oil company Woodside Energy Group (WDS.AX), will replace Murray Auchincloss as the head of BP.
Auchincloss, the embattled CEO whose lasting mark on the company will be a stilted attempt to turn BP back toward fossil fuels after a failed pivot to renewables, is stepping down immediately. Head of trading Carol Howle will run the oil giant until April 1, when O'Neill steps into the top job, BP said in its announcement.
Auchincloss is departing the CEO job after less than two years in the role, marking BP's fourth chief executive in a little more than four years. The tumultuous period that saw BP swing toward renewables under former CEO Bernard Looney and then swing back toward fossil fuels under Auchincloss, when the renewables pivot failed to produce results.
In a statement shared by BP, Auchincloss said, ""When Albert [Manifold] became Chair, I expressed my openness to step down were an appropriate leader identified who could accelerate delivery of bp’s strategy.""
Part of the company's move back toward fossil fuels was pushed by a pressure campaign from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.
O'Neill, who will be BP's first female chief executive and the first outsider to helm the company, currently leads Australia's largest oil company, Woodside. She is leaving that role immediately, according to a statement provided to The New York Times.
She has led growth initiatives for Woodside in the US, including the $1.2 billion acquisition of liquified natural gas (LNG) operator Tellurian.
“[O'Neill's] proven track record of driving transformation, growth, and disciplined capital allocation makes her the right leader for bp,"" BP chair Albert Manifold said in a statement. ""Her relentless focus on business improvement and financial discipline gives us high confidence in her ability to shape this great company for its next phase of growth and pursue significant strategic and financial opportunities.""

Jobless claims hold steady
Applications for unemployment benefits dropped for the week ending Dec. 13, the Department of Labor reported on Thursday, after rising the previous week.
The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell by 13,000 to 224,000, while the four-week moving average ticked up slightly to 217,500. Ongoing unemployment claims for the week ending Dec. 6 rose to 1.89 million.
The volatile weekly data comes amid a murky picture for the labor market. On Tuesday, the November jobs report indicated better-than-expected job gains during the month, though the unemployment rate also crept higher.
And after Thursday's CPI report showing inflation pressures eased in November, bets that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again in January rose slightly. Traders now see 26.6% odds of a rate cut next month, compared to 24% a day earlier.

Stocks rise as investors digest a lower-than-expected inflation reading
US stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors reacted to lower-than-expected inflation readings for the 12 months ended in November.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the rise, ticking up by 1.5% as strong earnings from Micron (MU) buoyed the sector. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.8% and 1%, respectively.
Leading the day is a cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed inflation rose 2.7% through the 12 months ended in November and 2.6% on a ""core"" basis, excluding food and energy. Both figures came in below analyst estimates.
In the labor market, the Department of Labor reported initial jobless claims of 224,000 for the week ended Dec. 13, down 13,000 from the previous week's figure.

Stock market jumps on lower than expected year-over-year inflation
Futures on major stock market indexes jumped to the upside after Consumer Price Index data showed inflation eased over the 12 months ended in November.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led the way up, picking up 1.2% or more than 300 points, while futures on the E-Mini S&P 500 (ES=F) and the blue chip-heavy Mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) ticked up by 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively.
In the fixed income market, interest rates on 10-year US Treasurys (^TNX) shed around 0.7% in the minutes after the inflation data's release.
Headline CPI came in below expectations, with a reading of 2.7% surprising to the downside against an expected 3.1%. Similarly, ""core CPI,"" stripping out the volatile food and energy categories, came in at 2.6% against economists' expectations of 3%.

Inflation slows down in November as consumer prices rise 2.7% year-on-year
Consumer prices rose 2.7% through the 12 months ended in November, according to data released Thursday morning, keeping US inflation above the Federal Reserve's target but coming in significantly lower than analyst forecasts.
Stocks on the London blue-chip index FTSE 100 (^FTSE) were flat on Thursday after the Bank of England cut interest rates to their lowest level in nearly three years.
The committee voted 5-4 to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a rate of 3.75%, citing increased risks to the labor market and the expectation that inflation will fall toward its target more quickly. The four who voted against cutting rates preferred holding rates steady.
The central bank cut rates for the sixth time after the Federal Reserve also opted to lower interest rates last week to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.
""We still think rates are on a gradual path downward,"" BoE governor Andrew Bailey said. ""But with every cut we make, how much further we go becomes a closer call.""
The central banks of Sweden and Norway decided to maintain their borrowing rates. The European Central Bank, which is scheduled to announce its decision today, is also expected to leave rates unchanged.

Stock bulls have a worryingly long list of 2026 risks to ponder
US stocks will come up against a long list of potential stumbling blocks next year, according to Bloomberg, linked to risks around AI expectations; valuation and concentration; inflation and rates; geopolitics and trade, and a macroeconomic slowdown.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-rise-as-cpi-inflation-eases-in-november-micron-boosts-tech-143506528.html,

The 10-year T-note yield rose three basis points to 4.15% on negative carryover from a jump in 10-year Japanese bond yields to the highest level since 1999 after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates to a three-decade high.
In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indices closed higher. Micron Technology (MU) surged over +10% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after the largest U.S. memory-chip maker posted upbeat FQ1 results and gave a blowout FQ2 forecast. Also, the Magnificent Seven stocks advanced, with Tesla (TSLA) rising more than +3% and Amazon.com (AMZN) gaining over +2%. In addition, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) jumped more than +41% after announcing a merger with TAE Technologies in an all-stock transaction valued at over $6 billion.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report released on Thursday showed that the CPI rose +2.7% y/y in November, weaker than expectations of +3.1% y/y. Also, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose +2.6% y/y in November, weaker than expectations of +3.0% y/y. In addition, the U.S. Philly Fed manufacturing index unexpectedly fell to -10.2 in December, weaker than expectations of 2.5. Finally, the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -13K to 224K, in line with expectations.
“November’s inflation undershoot has armed Fed doves with strong ammunition for a January rate cut,” said Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management. “Distortions can’t be ruled out, but the sharp drop in annual inflation leaves the Fed with little excuse not to respond to rising unemployment.”
U.S. rate futures have priced in a 75.6% probability of no rate change and a 24.4% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at January’s monetary policy meeting.
Meanwhile, Wall Street is bracing for a quarterly event known as “triple-witching,” during which derivatives contracts linked to equities, index options, and futures expire, prompting traders collectively to either roll over their current positions or initiate new ones. According to Bloomberg, a record $7.1 trillion in notional open interest is set to roll off today as contracts expire across the U.S. options market.
On the economic data front, investors will focus on the University of Michigan’s U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists anticipate that the final December figure will be revised higher to 53.5 from the preliminary reading of 53.3.
U.S. Existing Home Sales data will also be released today. Economists foresee this figure coming in at 4.15 million in November, compared to 4.10 million in October.

The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.02% this morning, taking a breather after strong gains in the previous session. Bank and industrial stocks gained ground on Friday, while technology and consumer stocks underperformed. The benchmark index is on track to end the week with solid gains. A survey released on Friday showed that German consumer sentiment is poised to drop sharply heading into 2026 amid economic uncertainty and a rising preference to save rather than spend. Separately, data showed that U.K. monthly retail sales unexpectedly fell in November, as consumers remained cautious ahead of the budget and potential tax increases. Meanwhile, European Central Bank Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in an interview with Le Figaro that the ECB will maintain flexibility over the future path of interest rates amid downside risks to inflation. “There are risks in both directions for inflation, but particularly downside risks. We will therefore be as agile as necessary in each of our upcoming meetings,” Villeroy told Le Figaro. In other news, the European Union pushed back its own deadline to sign off a free trade agreement with Latin American countries to January. In corporate news, Wh Smith Plc (SMWH.LN) fell over -4% after the U.K.’s financial regulator said it was probing the company over accounting failures.
U.K. Retail Sales, U.K. Core Retail Sales, Germany’s GfK Consumer Climate Index, Germany’s PPI, and Eurozone’s Current Account data were released today.
U.K. November Retail Sales fell -0.1% m/m and rose +0.6% y/y, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m and +1.6% y/y.
U.K. November Core Retail Sales fell -0.2% m/m and rose +1.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +1.6% y/y.

Asian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.36%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +1.03%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today, marking a third straight session of gains. Tourism stocks climbed on Friday, with China Tourism Group Duty Free jumping more than +8% after China launched a $113 billion free-trade experiment on Hainan island. Also, defense stocks extended their gains after the Trump administration announced on Wednesday a major arms sale to Taiwan worth around $11 billion. Meanwhile, chip stocks were little changed after Reuters reported that the Trump administration has initiated a review that could allow the first shipments of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China. The benchmark index ended the week roughly flat. In other news, inflows into a group of exchange-traded funds tracking the CSI A500 Index jumped to a new record on Thursday. “It’s possible that there’s some sort of broadly-defined ‘national team’ at work” to support markets, said Chen Shi, a fund manager at Shanghai Jade Stone Investment Management. In corporate news, Man Wah Holdings climbed about +8% in Hong Kong after its unit agreed to acquire U.S. furniture maker Gainline Recline Intermediate Corp. for $58.7 million, including debt.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, led by gains in the tech sector, while government bond yields climbed after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates to a three-decade high. Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers on Friday, tracking an overnight rally in their U.S. peers following a blowout forecast from chipmaker Micron. The benchmark index held its gains after the BOJ raised borrowing costs as expected. The central bank raised its policy rate to 0.75% from 0.50% in a unanimous decision, reflecting policymakers’ increasing confidence that wage growth and inflation are moving in tandem. The hike lifts borrowing costs to their highest level since 1995. In its statement, the central bank said it would pursue further rate hikes if the economy and prices evolve in line with its projections. Japan’s benchmark 10-year bond yield climbed above 2% for the first time in nearly two decades following the announcement. At the same time, the yen weakened as much as 1.1% against the dollar amid a lack of clear guidance on the timing of future monetary tightening. Governor Kazuo Ueda said at a press conference that there remains scope to raise rates further, but how far and how fast the BOJ proceeds must be determined carefully based on developments in prices and the economy. Meanwhile, the benchmark index notched a weekly loss. Government data released earlier on Friday showed that Japan’s core inflation rose 3.0% in November from a year earlier, remaining above the central bank’s 2% target for the 44th consecutive month.

Lower bond yields today are supporting stock index futures.
This week, investors will focus on key U.S. economic data, including monthly employment and inflation figures, comments from Federal Reserve officials, and earnings reports from several high-profile companies.
In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major equity averages closed sharply lower. Broadcom (AVGO) plunged over -11% and was the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq 100 after the software and semiconductor giant’s sales outlook for the AI market fell short of investors’ lofty expectations. Also, Sandisk (SNDK) tumbled more than -14% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after GF Securities downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy. In addition, Ciena Corp. (CIEN) slumped over -9% after Northland Securities downgraded the stock to Market Perform from Outperform with a $190 price target. On the bullish side, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) surged more than +9% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after the retailer posted upbeat Q3 results and raised its full-year guidance.
Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said on Friday that she would prefer interest rates to be somewhat more restrictive to continue putting pressure on inflation, which remains too high. “Right now, we’ve got policy that’s right around neutral,” Hammack said. Also, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said he dissented against the latest FOMC’s decision to cut interest rates because inflation remains “too high” and policy should stay modestly restrictive to contain it. At the same time, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he is penciling in more rate cuts for 2026 than many of his colleagues, but dissented against a rate cut at the December meeting because he wanted to wait for additional inflation data. In addition, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson said, “On net, I am still a little more concerned about labor market weakness than about upside risks to inflation.”
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 75.6% probability of no rate change and a 24.4% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in January.
This week, a slew of delayed U.S. economic data will give investors and policymakers a long-awaited snapshot of the labor market and broader economy. The jobs report and consumer price index for November will be the main highlights, starting to shape the outlook for interest rates in 2026. U.S. retail sales data for October will also draw attention, along with preliminary purchasing managers’ surveys on manufacturing and services sector activity. Other noteworthy data releases include the U.S. Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, Initial Jobless Claims, Business Inventories, Existing Home Sales, and the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index.
Market participants will also parse comments from several Fed officials, with the key question now being how far and how fast interest rates will fall in 2026. The Fed has projected just one rate cut next year, but many in the market anticipate more, with U.S. money markets fully pricing in two reductions. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller, along with New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, are scheduled to speak this week.
In addition, several notable companies, including chipmaker Micron Technology (MU), advisory firm Accenture (ACN), sneaker maker Nike (NKE), and shipping giant FedEx (FDX), are set to report their quarterly figures this week.
Today, investors will focus on the New York Fed-compiled Empire State Manufacturing Index, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists expect the December figure to come in at 9.8, compared to 18.7 in November.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.170%, down -0.60%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.51% this morning, starting a week filled with major central bank decisions and delayed U.S. economic data on an upbeat note. Bank and mining stocks outperformed on Monday. At the same time, healthcare stocks fell, with Sanofi (SAN.FP) sliding over -3% as expectations grew that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would delay a decision on its multiple sclerosis drug, tolebrutinib. Data from Eurostat released on Monday showed that Eurozone industrial production growth picked up in October, as early signs of a recovery in Germany helped ease concerns over the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on the bloc’s factories. Meanwhile, market participants are bracing for a series of monetary policy decisions from central banks across the region this week, including those from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The ECB is widely expected to leave the deposit rate unchanged at 2.00%, and to keep it there throughout 2026. Attention will center on the ECB’s GDP and inflation forecasts. At the same time, the BoE is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75% as it looks to support a sluggish economy now that the long-awaited November budget is out of the way. Key data points in the euro region this week include flash readings of purchasing manager indexes and Germany’s closely watched Ifo business confidence gauge. Geopolitical developments also remain in focus, with investors keeping an eye on peace talks on Ukraine. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said progress was made during talks in Berlin on Sunday, with discussions between the U.S. delegation and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy resuming there on Monday.
Eurozone’s Industrial Production data was released today.
Eurozone’s October Industrial Production rose +0.8% m/m and +2.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.7% m/m and +1.9% y/y.
Asian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.55%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.31%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed lower today as downbeat economic data from the country and rising default risks at property developer Vanke dampened sentiment. Property stocks plunged on Monday, with China Vanke sliding about -3% after its bondholders rejected a one-year extension of a bond payment due Monday, heightening default risks for the state-backed developer. Semiconductor stocks also slumped after reports emerged that Nvidia is weighing an expansion of H200 chip production following strong demand from China. Risk appetite was further dampened by data showing China’s economic momentum slowed further in November, with all major indicators falling short of expectations. The National Bureau of Statistics said China’s factory output growth slowed to a 15-month low in November, retail sales growth was the weakest since the Covid period, and investment weakened further. Also, China’s property downturn worsened in November, with investment, home prices, and sales all notching steeper declines. The latest data back the case for Beijing to ramp up policy support at the start of 2026. In other corporate news, CMOC Group rose about +2% after the mining giant announced it was buying several Brazilian gold mines from Canada’s Equinox Gold in a deal valued at more than $1 billion.
The Chinese November Industrial Production rose +4.8% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.0% y/y.
The Chinese November Retail Sales rose +1.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +3.0% y/y.
The Chinese Fixed Asset Investment fell -2.6% y/y in the January-November period, weaker than expectations of -2.4% y/y.
The Chinese November Unemployment Rate was 5.1%, in line with expectations.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply lower today, tracking Wall Street’s losses on Friday. Technology stocks led the declines on Monday. At the same time, bank stocks advanced ahead of an anticipated interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan this week, with those expectations reinforced on Monday by the central bank’s quarterly Tankan survey. A BOJ survey showed that a key gauge of business sentiment in Japan reached a 4-year high in the fourth quarter as trade-related anxiety eased. The gauge reflects the percentage of companies reporting favorable business conditions minus those reporting unfavorable conditions. Daiwa Securities economist Kento Minami said the Tankan survey points to solid momentum in wage trends, a key factor in determining the central bank’s next interest rate hike. Meanwhile, the BOJ said on Monday that most Japanese companies it surveyed expect to raise wages in fiscal 2026 at roughly the same pace as this year, even as many brace for a tariff-related hit to profits. The special wage report comes as Gov. Ueda watches for early indications that this year’s strong pay gains will carry over into next year as inflation picks up. Investor focus this week is squarely on the BOJ’s monetary policy decision, where the central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%, marking the first hike since January. Market participants will closely watch Ueda’s post-meeting press conference for clues on how many additional rate hikes may be ahead. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +7.79% to 28.77.
The Japanese Tankan Large Manufacturers Index stood at 15 in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations.
The Japanese Tankan Large Non-Manufacturers Index came in at 34 in the fourth quarter, weaker than expectations of 35.

Stock indexes ended the day mildly higher ahead of Thursday’s Christmas holiday. US stock exchanges closed early at 1pm (Eastern) on Wednesday for Christmas Eve. The S&P 500 index on Wednesday edged to a new record high.
Stocks received a boost on Wednesday from the -2.9 bp decline in the 10-year T-note yield.
Stocks have continued support from confidence about the US economic outlook after Tuesday’s news that US Q3 real GDP rose by +4.3% (q/q annualized), much stronger than market expectations of +3.3%. However, most of Tuesday’s other US economic reports were on the weaker side, led by the -3.8 point drop in the Conference Board’s Dec US consumer confidence index to 89.1 from the revised Nov level of 92.9 (preliminary 88.7), which was weaker than market expectations of 91.0.
In a report released Wednesday, US weekly initial unemployment claims fell by -10,000 to 214,000 in the week ended Dec 20, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of 224,000. Continuing claims rose by +38,000 to 1.923 million from the previous week’s revised 1.885 million (preliminary 1.897 million), which showed a weaker labor market than expectations of 1.900 million.
China’s central bank on Wednesday issued a cautious statement after its quarterly monetary policy meeting. The PBOC indicated that it is focused on long-term stability and suggested that it will not engage in sudden interest rate cuts to address problems such as property market weakness, weak domestic demand, and the trade war with the US.
Seasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.
The markets are discounting the odds at 16% for a -25 bp rate cut at the FOMC’s next meeting on Jan 27-28.
Overseas stock markets closed mixed on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.05%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.53% for the sixth consecutive daily gain. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.14%.
Interest Rates
March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Wednesday rose by +7 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -2.9 bp to 3.134%. T-note prices saw support from the -0.4 bp decline in the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate to 2.236%. T-note prices were undercut by supply overhang as the Treasury on Wednesday sold $44 billion of 7-year T-notes.
European government bond yields were little changed. The 10-year German bund yield ended the day unchanged at 2.862%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell -0.2 bp to 4.507%.
Swaps are discounting a 3% chance of a +25 bp rate hike by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.
US Stock Movers
The Magnificent Seven stocks closed narrowly mixed. Apple (AAPL) rose +0.5%, but Nvidia (NVDA) fell -0.5%.
Intel (INTC) fell by -0.8% after Reuters reported that Nvidia (NVDA)halted a test using Intel’s 18A manufacturing process during a test run to make advanced chips, suggesting Nvidia sees deficiencies in the technology. Nvidia agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel in September as part of the deal, where the Trump administration took a 10% stake in Intel as a means to reinvigorate the US-based chip producer.
Otherwise, chip stocks closed mixed. Micron Technology (MU) rallied more than +3%, but Marvel Technology (MRVL) and ON Semiconductor (NXPI) fell by more than -1%.
Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed mixed, with Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) falling about -0.3%.

Nike (NKE) rallied +4.6% after news that Apple’s Tim Cook bought $2.95 million worth of Nike shares on December 22.
AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) fell -9% even though the company launched its largest satellite yet, beginning its effort to build a satellite-based Internet network to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink service.
Dynavax (DVAX) soared by +38% after news that Sanofi will buy the vaccine maker for about $2.2 billion.

The world’s largest sportswear company expects revenue to be down in the low-single digits in the three months that started Dec. 1, a surprising turn after two straight periods of growth.

While Nike is making progress, especially in North America and the running category, investors are eager for the company to make headway in other areas of the business that are lagging. Converse sales plunged 30% in the latest quarter, while Greater China was down 17%. Chief Executive Officer Elliott Hill characterized the company’s rebound as “in the middle innings.”
The shares fell as much as 11% on Friday in New York, the biggest intraday decline since April.
The stock had dropped 13% so far this year through Thursday’s close and is headed for its fourth consecutive annual decline. Shares of European rivals Adidas AG and Puma SE also dropped on the news, falling as much as 2.9% and 3.5% respectively on Friday.
After the earnings report, several analysts cut their price targets on Nike. That included Piper Sandler’s Anna Andreeva who said the turnaround is making progress, but it’s slower than expected with recovery in China taking more time.
On the company’s call with analysts, Hill said Nike’s recovery “won’t be a straight line, but we’re acting decisively to accelerate the lagging areas — with China at the top of that list.”
Nike reported declining store traffic in the Greater China region and struggled to sell off older inventory. The company is now focusing on Beijing and Shanghai while refining its product assortment.
“What we’ve done is a start, but it’s not happening at the level or the pace we need to drive wider change,” Hill said, referring to the market.
Over the past two years, China has become a deeply discount-driven market for sportswear, as consumers have curbed spending amid an economic slowdown, a property crisis and job market uncertainties. Nike faces steeper challenges than rivals such as Adidas, local giant Anta, and niche brands like Hoka, having failed to deliver standout products that capture the attention of increasingly sophisticated Chinese consumers, who now place greater value on experiences and niche performance features.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-sinks-china-sales-plunge-132907726.html,

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) put on 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained over 1.3%, building on Thursday's roaring rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.3%.
With the late-week rebound, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq booked weekly wins, rising 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively, in the last full week of trading in 2025 as Wall Street tries for a ""Santa Claus rally"" to end the year. The Dow fell 0.6% on the week.
On the tech front, Oracle (ORCL) stock jumped after China's ByteDance signed deals to create a US TikTok joint venture, including the company, which has had a turbulent week. Faith in the AI trade got another boost from Nvidia (NVDA), whose shares popped on a Reuters report that the US is reviewing prospects for sales of its H200 chips in China.
Meanwhile, nine pharmaceuticals struck deals with the Trump administration on Friday to lower drug prices for some Americans in exchange for a three-year tariff exemption on their products.
Investors got through a catch-up week for economic data with next year's rate-cut hopes intact, having embraced the outcome of this week's delayed November reports on jobs and consumer inflation despite warnings over their reliability.
A rosier inflation picture, combined with a weakening job market, has reignited hopes that the Federal Reserve will continue its recent string of easing.
A plurality of traders are still betting on two cuts next year but have shifted more bets in recent days toward more cuts. Friday will bring a final picture of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, after the firm's initial December survey found the key measure increasing for the first time in five months.
Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose to hit 4.15% as bond markets across the world absorbed the Bank of Japan's hike in interest rates to the highest level since 1995.
US stock markets will be open as scheduled on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26, the NYSE and Nasdaq said, after President Trump ordered the federal government to close on those days.

Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq end week on a high note as AI trade resumes
Stocks closed out the week on an up note as the AI trade appeared to get back on track.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.9%, helping the gauge recover losses earlier in the week.
Tech stocks rallied after investors shook off prior jitters over the AI trade.
Meanwhile, gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) traded near record highs, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $87,000, remaining within a two-week range as the token struggles to rebound meaningfully following its losses in October and November.
The stock market will be closed next Thursday, Dec. 25, for the Christmas holiday. The market on Wednesday, Dec. 24, will close at 1 p.m. ET.

Healthcare stocks rise on deals struck with Tump administration
Pharmaceutical stocks climbed after President Donald Trump announced pricing deals with nine drugmakers, offering a three-year pause on threatened tariffs in return for steps to reduce drug prices in the US.
Shares of Merck (MRK), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), and Novartis (NVS) all rose following the announcement.
The deals include reduced Medicaid prices, discounts to cash buyers, and commitments to launch new medicines domestically at prices comparable to those overseas.
The administration said more companies are expected to announce similar agreements next year.

CoreWeave stock surges 20%, recovering from recent losses
CoreWeave (CRWV) stock soared 20%, rebounding from last week's punishing losses, as Citi analysts resumed coverage of the stock and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) set its sights on a $100 billion fundraising round.
Citi reinstated coverage of CoreWeave with an adjusted price target of $135, down from its previous target of $192, but noted that the company is staring down ""overwhelming"" demand.
Also fueling CoreWeave's stock on Friday was a Wall Street Journal report that OpenAI is seeking to raise up to $100 billion, which would value the company at as high as $830 billion.
CoreWeave and OpenAI have been closely tied together since the two AI companies agreed to a $11.9 billion partnership that has since expanded to a contract value of up to $22.4 billion. Under the agreement, CoreWeave's AI computing data centers will power the training of its next-generation models.
In recent months, investors have grown more skeptical about OpenAI's high-priced dealmaking, leading to volatility in stocks like CoreWeave. Excluding Friday's gains, CoreWeave stock had been pacing for a 13% decline on the week as AI valuation concerns surfaced.

Cruise stocks gain as Carnival CEO says demand is proving resilient
Carnival's (CCL) strong 2026 guidance was the tide that lifted all cruise stocks on Friday.
Carnival stock surged over 8% in midday trading, while Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH) rose 6% and Royal Caribbean (RCL) gained about 3%.
""Demand for our cruise lines is proving far more resilient than traditional macro indicators would suggest,"" Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein said on the company's earnings call. Weinstein noted that Carnival is already about two-thirds booked for next year at historically high prices for North America and Europe.
For next year, Carnival expects adjusted net income to grow approximately 12% year over year on less than 1% capacity growth. The company expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.48, ahead of Wall Street's estimates.

Nike's challenges drag down footwear stocks
Nike (NKE) stock fell 9% during Friday's session, dragging other footwear stocks lower.
Shares of Deckers Outdoor (DECK), the maker of Hoka sneakers, dropped 1.3%, while shares of On Running (ONON) declined by 0.3% and Crocs (CROX) fell 1.2%. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), which sells Nike sneakers and apparel directly and recently acquired Foot Locker, traded slightly higher as of 11 a.m.
Nike earnings and revenue beat Wall Street estimates for its fiscal second quarter, but profits declined as the athletic apparel company faces dual headwinds from tariffs and China.
On the company's earnings call, CEO Elliott Hill said Nike is in the ""middle innings of our comeback.""
""We highlighted last quarter that it will take more time to return to healthy growth in Greater China and Converse, and we expect headwinds to continue for the balance of the fiscal year,"" Nike CFO Matthew Friend said on the call. ""As we highlighted last quarter, we are also navigating new structural headwinds from the $1.5 billion of annualized incremental product costs due to higher US tariffs.""

Consumer sentiment improves in December, but less than expected
University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment registered a final reading of 52.9 for December, up from 51 the previous month but below the 53.5 expected by economists tracked by Bloomberg.
""Despite some signs of improvement to close out the year, sentiment remains nearly 30% below December 2024, as pocketbook issues continue to dominate consumer views of the economy,"" wrote Joanne Hsu, the director of the university's consumer surveys.
Hsu noted that sentiment improved for lower-income consumers but was little changed for those with higher incomes.
Year-ahead inflation expectations fell, hitting the lowest reading in 11 months, at 4.2%

Nvidia jumps over 3% as chip stocks rally
Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped 3.7% half an hour after the open, putting the AI chip stalwart on track for a weekly gain.
The AI stalwart led the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks in gains on Friday after the Trump administration began its review of Nvidia H200 chip exports to China (scroll for more detail). Investors cheered the move as a sign that President Trump was moving ahead with his promise to allow Nvidia to sell advanced chips to China in exchange for a 25% fee to the government.
Other chipmakers and chip developers rallied in early trading. AMD (AMD) climbed nearly 5%, while Intel (INTC) advanced 3%. Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.5%. Micron (MU) investors extended their post-earnings buying spree, with the stock rising 7% on Friday after Thursday's 10% gain.

Stocks jump at the open
US stocks jumped at the open Friday.
The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, up nearly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.5%, helping the gauged nearly recover losses earlier in the week. The indexes were set for slight, fractional weekly losses as of Friday morning.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), meanwhile, put on 0.4% but was still set to see a five-day loss of roughly 0.6%.

DraftKings launches prediction market. The stock is rising.
DraftKings (DKNG) stock gained 1.7% just ahead of the opening bell on Friday after the company said it has formally entered the prediction markets.
Under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), DraftKings will set up a mobile app and web offering that will allow users to bet on future outcomes. Event contracts in sports and financial markets will be available initially in 38 states, although the company plans to expand to additional categories, such as entertainment and culture.
Prediction markets have boomed in 2025 as a lighter regulatory touch by the Trump administration has opened the floodgates for platforms to cash in. In late November, Robinhood (HOOD) expanded its fast-growing prediction market services as new competitors try to take share from the incumbents, Kalshi and Polymarket.
But some warn of the behavioral risks inherent in prediction markets, saying that the speculative nature of the markets could create credit stress down the road if bettors struggle to pay their bills.
Treasury yields jump after Bank of Japan hikes rates to highest level since 1995
US Treasury prices fell on Friday, lifting yields, after the Bank of Japan hiked its policy rate to its highest level in 30 years.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose 3 basis points to 4.15% while the 30-year yield (^TYX) hit 4.83%. The 5-year yield (^FVX) increased to 3.69%.
Global bond yields rose after the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate by 0.25% to 0.75%, its highest level since 1995, as it kept rates near zero for years in an effort to fight deflation.
The effects of Japan's rate hike have ripple effects in the US too: The increase in Japanese rates could make the so-called carry trade — in which investors borrow cheaply in Japan and then seek higher-yielding US Treasurys and other assets — less attractive.
Oil heads for second weekly decline as glut concerns dominate
Oil headed for its second weekly decline as concerns about a growing glut continued to weigh on prices.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, rose 0.6% to $60 a barrel on Friday morning but was down 1.4% on the week. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, gained 0.8% to trade hands at $56 a barrel but was down 1.7% for the week.
Oil prices declined for the week even as a Ukrainian strike on an oil tanker connected to Russia's shadow fleet escalated a string of attacks in the Mediterranean.
Nvidia stock rises as US launches review that could unblock H200 shipments to China
The Trump administration has launched a review that could result in Nvidia (NVDA) being allowed to make its first shipments of advanced AI chips to China, sources told Reuters.
Shares of the chipmaking giant rose before the bell as investors welcomed the sign that President Trump will make good on his pledge to allow the controversial sales of the H200 chips.

Premarket trending tickers: FedEx, Toyota, and Coinbase
FedEx (FDX) stock fell 1% before the bell on Friday after the company announced improved results in the quarter ending Nov. 30. However, the global courier delivery services incurred $25 million in additional costs in November after the UPS cargo plane crash grounded some of FedEx's fleet.
Toyota (TM) stock edged up higher during premarket trading, rising more than 1% after the auto group said it will ship three models produced in America to Japan in 2026 in a bid to appease President Trump.
Coinbase (COIN) stock rose 3% before the bell on Friday. The crypto exchange said it plans to sue three US states over their attempts to regulate prediction markets.
CoreWeave (CRWV) stock jumped 5% during premarket trading on Friday. Improved sentiment on Thursday after Micron's outlook beat expectations has helped drive demand for memory chips used in data centers. Citi (C) also resumed coverage of the stock, setting a price target that indicated its stock could double from current levels.

Nike stock slumps as China struggles continue and tariff drag persists
Nike reported a drop in quarterly profits, citing a drag from higher US tariffs and continued weakness in China in its results on Thursday.

Futures on the Nasdaq 100 outperformed amid renewed appetite for technology stocks, boosting hopes for a “Santa Claus” rally. Most members of the Magnificent Seven stocks advanced in pre-market trading, with Tesla and Nvidia rising over +1%. Chip stocks also gained ground in pre-market trading, led by a more than +3% rise in Micron Technology.
However, higher bond yields today are limiting gains in stock index futures. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 4.17% on negative carryover from a jump in 10-year Japanese bond yields to the highest level since February 1999 following the Bank of Japan’s rate hike on Friday.
This week, investors will focus on a few U.S. economic data releases.
In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major equity averages ended in the green. Carnival (CCL) surged over +9% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after the cruise company posted better-than-expected Q4 adjusted EPS and issued above-consensus FY26 adjusted EPS guidance. Also, chip stocks rallied, with Micron Technology (MU) climbing about +7% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rising more than +6%. In addition, Oracle (ORCL) advanced over +6% after the company and two other investors signed agreements with TikTok and its Chinese parent ByteDance to establish a new joint venture called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. On the bearish side, Nike (NKE) plunged more than -10% and was the top percentage loser on the Dow after the company said it expects sales to drop by a low single-digit percentage in the current quarter amid ongoing weakness in China and at its Converse brand.
“The trend remains positive, and a Santa Claus rally into the year-end won’t surprise anyone. I am expecting nothing less than a strong finish to the year and a strong start to 2026,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates. Notably, since 1928, the S&P 500 has advanced 75% of the time during the final two weeks of December, averaging a 1.3% gain, according to data from Citadel Securities.
Economic data released on Friday showed that U.S. existing home sales rose +0.5% m/m to a 9-month high of 4.13 million in November, but came in below expectations of 4.15 million. At the same time, the University of Michigan’s U.S. December consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower to 52.9, weaker than expectations of 53.5.
New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday there is no urgency to lower interest rates again, given recent jobs and inflation data, reinforcing expectations for a pause after the central bank cut rates at its last three meetings. “I don’t personally have a sense of urgency to need to act further on monetary policy right now, because I think the cuts we’ve made have positioned us really well,” Williams said. He added that there are “no signs of a sharp deterioration at all” in the labor market.
Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on Sunday that she sees no need to change interest rates for several months following a series of recent cuts. “My base case is that we can stay here for some period of time, until we get clearer evidence that either inflation is coming back down to target or the employment side is weakening more materially,” Hammack said.
U.S. rate futures have priced in an 80.1% chance of no rate change and a 19.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the conclusion of the Fed’s January meeting.
Meanwhile, the U.S. stock markets will close early at 1 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday for Christmas Eve and remain closed on Thursday for Christmas Day.
In this holiday-shortened week, investors will be monitoring several key U.S. economic data releases. A trio of reports delayed by the government shutdown are scheduled for release this week, with the initial estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product taking center stage. “We believe the latest numbers point to the U.S. economy being in a good place, but risks remain. Surveys point to unease among households about job-market prospects, and there have been numerous high-profile job cut announcements citing AI and cost cuts,” analysts at BNP Paribas said in a note. Notably, the Commerce Department will not release third-quarter GDP in its usual sequence of three successive estimates and will instead publish only two readings. The final estimate is slated to be released on January 22nd. U.S. Durable Goods Orders data for October, along with the Fed’s industrial production reports for both October and November, will also attract attention. Other noteworthy data releases include the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, and Initial Jobless Claims.
The U.S. economic data slate is empty on Monday.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.17%, up +0.68%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.22% this morning, taking a breather as markets head into a holiday-shortened week ahead of Christmas. Food and beverage stocks underperformed on Monday, while mining and technology stocks advanced. Trading conditions are likely to stay muted this week, as the calendar is shortened by the Christmas holiday, with most major European stock exchanges shut on Thursday and Friday. Final data from the Office for National Statistics confirmed on Monday that the U.K. economy expanded by just 0.1% in the third quarter from the prior quarter. Although growth was unrevised, the “shape of growth is a bit healthier and less reliant on the public sector than previously estimated,” said Capital Economics economist Alex Kerr. Meanwhile, European Central Bank Governing Council member Peter Kazimir said on Monday that the ECB is comfortable with the Eurozone inflation outlook, but stands ready to act again if necessary. “The coming year is likely to bring new challenges that households, firms, and indeed our policy may have to respond to. We remain flexible and ready to step in should future developments warrant fresh action,” Kazimir said. On the geopolitical front, focus remains on efforts to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. In corporate news, Abivax (ABVX.FP) jumped over +10% after fresh reports revived speculation that Eli Lilly was exploring a takeover of the biotech firm.
U.K. GDP data was released today.
U.K. GDP has been reported at +0.1% q/q and +1.3% y/y in the third quarter, in line with expectations.
Asian stock markets today settled in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.69%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +1.81%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today, lifted by indications of continued capital inflows and the creation of a free trade port in Hainan. Latest data showed that China’s private fund sector grew to a record 22.1 trillion yuan in November, supported by strong inflows into equities. Sentiment was also aided by a jump in Hainan stocks after China last week began operating the Hainan Free Trade Port. Chip and other AI-related stocks also gained ground. Meanwhile, China left its benchmark lending rates unchanged for a seventh straight month on Monday, in line with expectations, as the world’s second-largest economy remains on course to meet its annual growth target. The one-year LPR remained at 3.00%, while the five-year LPR was kept at 3.50%. In other news, Reuters reported that China Vanke narrowly avoided a default on Monday after onshore bondholders approved a plan to extend the grace period on a 2 billion yuan bond repayment to 30 trading days. In corporate news, Moore Threads Technology rose over +1% after the chip designer introduced a range of new products, including its next-generation chip architecture and AI chips. Investors are now awaiting China’s industrial profits data for November later this week, which will offer insight into how companies are coping with excess-capacity pressures.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply higher today, reclaiming the 50,000-point level. Japanese equities were buoyed by a weaker yen and Friday’s rally on Wall Street. Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers on Monday, with SoftBank Group rising over +4% after Reuters reported that the company was pushing to finalize a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds fell further on Monday, with the 10-year yield reaching a 26-year high, following the Bank of Japan’s rate hike on Friday. The rise in government bond yields was also partly driven by speculation that the BOJ may need to hike interest rates more aggressively to curb persistent yen weakness. JPMorgan expects two rate hikes next year, one in April and another in October, which would lift the policy rate to 1.25% by the end of 2026. Investors anticipate that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will “allow the BOJ to further raise interest rates if it is to curb the yen’s depreciation, which is the administration’s greatest fear in order to maintain its high approval ratings,” according to Ryutaro Kimura, a senior fixed-income strategist at AXA Investment Managers. The Japanese currency, which had fallen to as low as 157.78 per dollar, regained some footing on Monday after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama and top currency official Atsushi Mimura issued warnings on recent moves. Investor attention this week is on a raft of Japan’s economic data, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, retail sales, and employment figures. Investors will also focus on Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda’s speech this week, as they seek guidance on the central bank’s policy path. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -7.14% to 25.36.

Cook, who has served on Nike’s board since 2005 and has been its lead independent director since 2016, purchased 50,000 Class B shares on December 22 at $58.97 each, spending about $3 million, as per a Reuters report.

Largest Insider Purchase at Nike in Over a Decade

Analyst Jonathan Komp of Baird Equity Research said that, ""Cook's move as a positive signal for the progress under CEO Elliott Hill and Nike's ""Win Now"" actions,"" as quoted by Reuters.Insider Buying Comes Amid Margin and China Challenges For Nike
The insider buying comes at a challenging time for Nike. The company recently reported weaker quarterly margins and sluggish sales in China, even as Hill works to revive demand through new marketing efforts and innovation focused on running and sports. Nike is also phasing out underperforming lifestyle brands and repairing relationships with wholesalers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods to improve visibility with shoppers.Those efforts, however, have put pressure on margins, which have been declining for more than a year. Nike’s attempts to regain momentum in price-sensitive China have also struggled.
Cook is known to be closely connected to Nike co-founder Phil Knight and has advised the company through major strategic decisions, including Hill’s appointment last year.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way up with a gain of 1.4%, pushed north by a strong earnings report from Micron (MU), which saw its shares rise 10%. The tech gain came after AI trade worries had spurred another bruising session for tech on Wednesday.
Shares in the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose around 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively.
Headlining the morning was a cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed inflation rose 2.7% in November over the prior year and 2.6% on a ""core"" basis — both figures coming in below economist estimates of 3% and 3.1%, respectively.
On the jobs front, the Department of Labor reported initial jobless claims of 224,000 for the week ended Dec. 13, down 13,000 from the previous week's figure. But that data has also been subject to significant volatility in the wake of the federal shutdown.
Elsewhere, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT, DJTWW) agreed to a $6 billion deal to merge with Tae Technologies, a fusion power group backed by Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Chevron (CVX). Shares in Trump Media, the home of the Truth Social platform, surged after the announcement, seen as a bet on AI-fueled energy demand.

Stocks jump as Micron earnings put AI trade back on track
Stocks jumped on Thursday as Micron Technology's (MU) earnings put the AI trade back on track, and cooler-than-expected inflation raised the odds of more dovish Federal Reserve policy next year.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 1.3%, recovering from losses on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8% while the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up by about 0.1%.
Micron results came in well above expectations, showing data center demand for memory chips is strong. The company's production for next year is already 100% allocated, lifting optimism that the AI trade is far from over.
Stocks also rose after the latest reading on consumer prices for November came in cooler than expected, although October's data was not collected due to the government shutdown.
Economists expect the Fed could lean toward more cuts in 2026 if inflation is kept under control.

Trump Media & Technology Group extends gains to 44%

Cannabis stocks jump as Trump signs order aimed at easing restrictions on industry
Cannabis-related stocks jumped on Thursday after President Trump signed an executive action aimed at reclassifying cannabis under federal law, a move expected to bring major changes to its regulation and economic impact.
Tilray (TLRY) jumped 2%, while Canopy Growth (CGC) jumped 6%.
The directive calls on the Department of Justice to initiate the process of transferring cannabis to a classification applied to substances that have acknowledged medical benefits and a comparatively lower risk of misuse.
The shift could pave the way for expanded scientific study and the approval of cannabis-related treatments by the FDA, while also easing financial and regulatory pressures on businesses operating in the cannabis sector.

Hut 8 CEO says $7 billion data center deal with Google is 'first domino to fall'
Hut 8 (HUT) is the latest crypto miner pivoting to power AI compute.
In a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) that was backstopped by Google (GOOG). The stock fell 2% on Thursday following a 20% gain the day before.
Micron (MU) powered tech stocks higher on Thursday after the company's quarterly results showed that AI-linked demand for high-bandwidth memory chips boosted revenue.
Micron shares rose 12% as of midday, lifting the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 1.6%. Stocks in the semiconductor and software infrastructure industries added over 2%, including a roughly 2.5% gain in Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD).
The upswing came after Micron's first quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported, as revenue from Micron's storage chips for data centers surpassed $1 billion for the first time.
""On any dip, this is an extraordinary opportunity because this is an industry that is an oligopoly,"" Freedom Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance, referring to the DRAM market. ""Micron and two South Korean players [Samsung & SK Hynix] control about 90% of the share.""

UBS: AI story remains intact, could reach $3 trillion in revenue potential by 2030
As momentum behind the AI trade returns to US markets, UBS said there's more room to run.
""Without taking any single-stock views, we believe the overall AI story remains intact,"" UBS Global Wealth Management's Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi wrote in a note to clients. ""Demand for AI compute remains strong, and we estimate that the required compute capacity in the coming years could be orders of magnitude greater than today’s installed base.""
Wednesday's trading session showed that fears about an AI bubble persist, however, as tech stocks led the markets lower after a report from the Financial Times said Oracle's partner Blue Owl Capital would not back its $10 billion data center.
But UBS's Hoffmann-Burchardi doesn't share those concerns. ""We do not see evidence of an investment bubble, with company fundamentals in aggregate still robust,"" Hoffmann-Burchardi said Thursday morning.
He believes the market could see tremendous growth from here.
""We expect the total addressable market for AI to reach $3.1 trillion in revenue potential by 2030 — a 30% compound annual growth rate over the next five years,"" he wrote.
Adding to a positive string of outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into next year, UBS predicts the S&P 500 could reach 7,300 by June next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026, boosted by earnings growth of 10%, looser Fed policy, and the broadening of AI adoption.
""We believe the structural trends of electrification and longevity will also drive equity performance for the long term,"" the firm wrote in its note.

BP shares sink on news of surprise CEO change
Shares in British energy major BP plc (BP) shed roughly 2.2% in early trading on Thursday as investors digested the news from Wednesday night that Meg O'Neill, the CEO of Australian oil company Woodside Energy Group (WDS.AX), will replace Murray Auchincloss as the head of BP.
Auchincloss, the embattled CEO whose lasting mark on the company will be a stilted attempt to turn BP back toward fossil fuels after a failed pivot to renewables, is stepping down immediately. Head of trading Carol Howle will run the oil giant until April 1, when O'Neill steps into the top job, BP said in its announcement.
Auchincloss is departing the CEO job after less than two years in the role, marking BP's fourth chief executive in a little more than four years. The tumultuous period that saw BP swing toward renewables under former CEO Bernard Looney and then swing back toward fossil fuels under Auchincloss, when the renewables pivot failed to produce results.
In a statement shared by BP, Auchincloss said, ""When Albert [Manifold] became Chair, I expressed my openness to step down were an appropriate leader identified who could accelerate delivery of bp’s strategy.""
Part of the company's move back toward fossil fuels was pushed by a pressure campaign from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.
O'Neill, who will be BP's first female chief executive and the first outsider to helm the company, currently leads Australia's largest oil company, Woodside. She is leaving that role immediately, according to a statement provided to The New York Times.
She has led growth initiatives for Woodside in the US, including the $1.2 billion acquisition of liquified natural gas (LNG) operator Tellurian.
“[O'Neill's] proven track record of driving transformation, growth, and disciplined capital allocation makes her the right leader for bp,"" BP chair Albert Manifold said in a statement. ""Her relentless focus on business improvement and financial discipline gives us high confidence in her ability to shape this great company for its next phase of growth and pursue significant strategic and financial opportunities.""

Jobless claims hold steady
Applications for unemployment benefits dropped for the week ending Dec. 13, the Department of Labor reported on Thursday, after rising the previous week.
The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell by 13,000 to 224,000, while the four-week moving average ticked up slightly to 217,500. Ongoing unemployment claims for the week ending Dec. 6 rose to 1.89 million.
The volatile weekly data comes amid a murky picture for the labor market. On Tuesday, the November jobs report indicated better-than-expected job gains during the month, though the unemployment rate also crept higher.
And after Thursday's CPI report showing inflation pressures eased in November, bets that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again in January rose slightly. Traders now see 26.6% odds of a rate cut next month, compared to 24% a day earlier.

Stocks rise as investors digest a lower-than-expected inflation reading
US stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors reacted to lower-than-expected inflation readings for the 12 months ended in November.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the rise, ticking up by 1.5% as strong earnings from Micron (MU) buoyed the sector. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.8% and 1%, respectively.
Leading the day is a cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed inflation rose 2.7% through the 12 months ended in November and 2.6% on a ""core"" basis, excluding food and energy. Both figures came in below analyst estimates.
In the labor market, the Department of Labor reported initial jobless claims of 224,000 for the week ended Dec. 13, down 13,000 from the previous week's figure.

Stock market jumps on lower than expected year-over-year inflation
Futures on major stock market indexes jumped to the upside after Consumer Price Index data showed inflation eased over the 12 months ended in November.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led the way up, picking up 1.2% or more than 300 points, while futures on the E-Mini S&P 500 (ES=F) and the blue chip-heavy Mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) ticked up by 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively.
In the fixed income market, interest rates on 10-year US Treasurys (^TNX) shed around 0.7% in the minutes after the inflation data's release.
Headline CPI came in below expectations, with a reading of 2.7% surprising to the downside against an expected 3.1%. Similarly, ""core CPI,"" stripping out the volatile food and energy categories, came in at 2.6% against economists' expectations of 3%.

Inflation slows down in November as consumer prices rise 2.7% year-on-year
Consumer prices rose 2.7% through the 12 months ended in November, according to data released Thursday morning, keeping US inflation above the Federal Reserve's target but coming in significantly lower than analyst forecasts.
Stocks on the London blue-chip index FTSE 100 (^FTSE) were flat on Thursday after the Bank of England cut interest rates to their lowest level in nearly three years.
The committee voted 5-4 to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a rate of 3.75%, citing increased risks to the labor market and the expectation that inflation will fall toward its target more quickly. The four who voted against cutting rates preferred holding rates steady.
The central bank cut rates for the sixth time after the Federal Reserve also opted to lower interest rates last week to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.
""We still think rates are on a gradual path downward,"" BoE governor Andrew Bailey said. ""But with every cut we make, how much further we go becomes a closer call.""
The central banks of Sweden and Norway decided to maintain their borrowing rates. The European Central Bank, which is scheduled to announce its decision today, is also expected to leave rates unchanged.

Healthcare stocks rise on deals struck with Tump administration
Pharmaceutical stocks climbed after President Donald Trump announced pricing deals with nine drugmakers, offering a three-year pause on threatened tariffs in return for steps to reduce drug prices in the US.
Shares of Merck (MRK), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), and Novartis (NVS) all rose following the announcement.
The deals include reduced Medicaid prices, discounts to cash buyers, and commitments to launch new medicines domestically at prices comparable to those overseas.
The administration said more companies are expected to announce similar agreements next year.

CoreWeave stock surges 20%, recovering from recent losses
CoreWeave (CRWV) stock soared 20%, rebounding from last week's punishing losses, as Citi analysts resumed coverage of the stock and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) set its sights on a $100 billion fundraising round.
Citi reinstated coverage of CoreWeave with an adjusted price target of $135, down from its previous target of $192, but noted that the company is staring down ""overwhelming"" demand.
Also fueling CoreWeave's stock on Friday was a Wall Street Journal report that OpenAI is seeking to raise up to $100 billion, which would value the company at as high as $830 billion.
CoreWeave and OpenAI have been closely tied together since the two AI companies agreed to a $11.9 billion partnership that has since expanded to a contract value of up to $22.4 billion. Under the agreement, CoreWeave's AI computing data centers will power the training of its next-generation models.
In recent months, investors have grown more skeptical about OpenAI's high-priced dealmaking, leading to volatility in stocks like CoreWeave. Excluding Friday's gains, CoreWeave stock had been pacing for a 13% decline on the week as AI valuation concerns surfaced.

Cruise stocks gain as Carnival CEO says demand is proving resilient
Carnival's (CCL) strong 2026 guidance was the tide that lifted all cruise stocks on Friday.
Carnival stock surged over 8% in midday trading, while Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH) rose 6% and Royal Caribbean (RCL) gained about 3%.
""Demand for our cruise lines is proving far more resilient than traditional macro indicators would suggest,"" Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein said on the company's earnings call. Weinstein noted that Carnival is already about two-thirds booked for next year at historically high prices for North America and Europe.
For next year, Carnival expects adjusted net income to grow approximately 12% year over year on less than 1% capacity growth. The company expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.48, ahead of Wall Street's estimates.

Nike's challenges drag down footwear stocks
Nike (NKE) stock fell 9% during Friday's session, dragging other footwear stocks lower.
Shares of Deckers Outdoor (DECK), the maker of Hoka sneakers, dropped 1.3%, while shares of On Running (ONON) declined by 0.3% and Crocs (CROX) fell 1.2%. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), which sells Nike sneakers and apparel directly and recently acquired Foot Locker, traded slightly higher as of 11 a.m.
Nike earnings and revenue beat Wall Street estimates for its fiscal second quarter, but profits declined as the athletic apparel company faces dual headwinds from tariffs and China.
On the company's earnings call, CEO Elliott Hill said Nike is in the ""middle innings of our comeback.""
""We highlighted last quarter that it will take more time to return to healthy growth in Greater China and Converse, and we expect headwinds to continue for the balance of the fiscal year,"" Nike CFO Matthew Friend said on the call. ""As we highlighted last quarter, we are also navigating new structural headwinds from the $1.5 billion of annualized incremental product costs due to higher US tariffs.""

Consumer sentiment improves in December, but less than expected
University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment registered a final reading of 52.9 for December, up from 51 the previous month but below the 53.5 expected by economists tracked by Bloomberg.
""Despite some signs of improvement to close out the year, sentiment remains nearly 30% below December 2024, as pocketbook issues continue to dominate consumer views of the economy,"" wrote Joanne Hsu, the director of the university's consumer surveys.
Hsu noted that sentiment improved for lower-income consumers but was little changed for those with higher incomes.
Year-ahead inflation expectations fell, hitting the lowest reading in 11 months, at 4.2%

Nvidia jumps over 3% as chip stocks rally
Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped 3.7% half an hour after the open, putting the AI chip stalwart on track for a weekly gain.
The AI stalwart led the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks in gains on Friday after the Trump administration began its review of Nvidia H200 chip exports to China (scroll for more detail). Investors cheered the move as a sign that President Trump was moving ahead with his promise to allow Nvidia to sell advanced chips to China in exchange for a 25% fee to the government.
Other chipmakers and chip developers rallied in early trading. AMD (AMD) climbed nearly 5%, while Intel (INTC) advanced 3%. Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.5%. Micron (MU) investors extended their post-earnings buying spree, with the stock rising 7% on Friday after Thursday's 10% gain.

Stocks jump at the open
US stocks jumped at the open Friday.
The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, up nearly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.5%, helping the gauged nearly recover losses earlier in the week. The indexes were set for slight, fractional weekly losses as of Friday morning.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), meanwhile, put on 0.4% but was still set to see a five-day loss of roughly 0.6%.

DraftKings launches prediction market. The stock is rising.
DraftKings (DKNG) stock gained 1.7% just ahead of the opening bell on Friday after the company said it has formally entered the prediction markets.
Under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), DraftKings will set up a mobile app and web offering that will allow users to bet on future outcomes. Event contracts in sports and financial markets will be available initially in 38 states, although the company plans to expand to additional categories, such as entertainment and culture.
Prediction markets have boomed in 2025 as a lighter regulatory touch by the Trump administration has opened the floodgates for platforms to cash in. In late November, Robinhood (HOOD) expanded its fast-growing prediction market services as new competitors try to take share from the incumbents, Kalshi and Polymarket.
But some warn of the behavioral risks inherent in prediction markets, saying that the speculative nature of the markets could create credit stress down the road if bettors struggle to pay their bills.
Treasury yields jump after Bank of Japan hikes rates to highest level since 1995
US Treasury prices fell on Friday, lifting yields, after the Bank of Japan hiked its policy rate to its highest level in 30 years.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose 3 basis points to 4.15% while the 30-year yield (^TYX) hit 4.83%. The 5-year yield (^FVX) increased to 3.69%.
Global bond yields rose after the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate by 0.25% to 0.75%, its highest level since 1995, as it kept rates near zero for years in an effort to fight deflation.
The effects of Japan's rate hike have ripple effects in the US too: The increase in Japanese rates could make the so-called carry trade — in which investors borrow cheaply in Japan and then seek higher-yielding US Treasurys and other assets — less attractive.
Oil heads for second weekly decline as glut concerns dominate
Oil headed for its second weekly decline as concerns about a growing glut continued to weigh on prices.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, rose 0.6% to $60 a barrel on Friday morning but was down 1.4% on the week. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, gained 0.8% to trade hands at $56 a barrel but was down 1.7% for the week.
Oil prices declined for the week even as a Ukrainian strike on an oil tanker connected to Russia's shadow fleet escalated a string of attacks in the Mediterranean.
Nvidia stock rises as US launches review that could unblock H200 shipments to China
The Trump administration has launched a review that could result in Nvidia (NVDA) being allowed to make its first shipments of advanced AI chips to China, sources told Reuters.
Shares of the chipmaking giant rose before the bell as investors welcomed the sign that President Trump will make good on his pledge to allow the controversial sales of the H200 chips.

Premarket trending tickers: FedEx, Toyota, and Coinbase
FedEx (FDX) stock fell 1% before the bell on Friday after the company announced improved results in the quarter ending Nov. 30. However, the global courier delivery services incurred $25 million in additional costs in November after the UPS cargo plane crash grounded some of FedEx's fleet.
Toyota (TM) stock edged up higher during premarket trading, rising more than 1% after the auto group said it will ship three models produced in America to Japan in 2026 in a bid to appease President Trump.
Coinbase (COIN) stock rose 3% before the bell on Friday. The crypto exchange said it plans to sue three US states over their attempts to regulate prediction markets.
CoreWeave (CRWV) stock jumped 5% during premarket trading on Friday. Improved sentiment on Thursday after Micron's outlook beat expectations has helped drive demand for memory chips used in data centers. Citi (C) also resumed coverage of the stock, setting a price target that indicated its stock could double from current levels.

Nike stock slumps as China struggles continue and tariff drag persists
Nike reported a drop in quarterly profits, citing a drag from higher US tariffs and continued weakness in China in its results on Thursday.
Shares in the sneaker giant tumbled 10% in premarket after the sharp fall in China revenue prompted CEO Elliott Hill to say improvements ""are not happening at the pace we like.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-rise-with-wall-street-set-to-wrap-up-latest-volatile-week-231719825.html,

By mid-morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.6%, adding more than 290 points. The S&P 500 gained roughly 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed more than 1%. The move helped markets recover part of their recent losses, even as weekly performance remained slightly negative.
Friday’s advance came as traders digested delayed U.S. economic reports released after the federal shutdown. Inflation data showed consumer prices cooling faster than expected in November, reviving hopes that the Federal Reserve could deliver multiple interest rate cuts in 2026. At the same time, signs of a softening job market reinforced expectations of easier monetary policy.
Tech stocks led the advance. Nvidia surged more than 3% after reports the Trump administration is reviewing prospects for sales of its H200 AI chips to China. Oracle spiked nearly 8% after China’s ByteDance selected the company for a U.S. TikTok joint venture deal. Chipmakers broadly followed higher, lifting the Nasdaq.
Investors also absorbed global rate developments. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to around 4.15% as bond markets reacted to the Bank of Japan’s rate hike, its highest since 1995. Even with Thursday’s rebound, major indexes remain under pressure for the final full trading week of 2025.
Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq recover after turbulent trading week
Despite Friday’s gains, major indexes remained slightly lower for the week. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have struggled in December amid a rotation out of large technology stocks. Hopes for a traditional “Santa Claus rally” have so far failed to materialize.The Dow stood near 48,200, while the S&P 500 traded around 6,820. The Nasdaq hovered above 23,200 in late morning trading.
Analysts noted that recent volatility reflects uncertainty around interest rates and earnings growth. Investors have become more selective, favoring value and defensive sectors over high-growth names. That shift has weighed on broader index performance despite periodic rebounds.
Nvidia shares climbed more than 3% after Reuters reported that the U.S. government is reviewing potential approvals for H200 chip exports to China. Investors viewed the move as progress toward allowing sales under a proposed fee structure, reviving confidence in the AI growth story.
Oracle surged nearly 8% after ByteDance signed deals to form a U.S.-based TikTok joint venture involving the company. The rally followed a volatile week for Oracle, easing concerns around recent uncertainty.
Other chip stocks moved higher. AMD gained nearly 5%. Intel rose about 3%. Broadcom added roughly 2.5%. Micron extended its post-earnings rally, jumping another 7% after a 10% surge a day earlier.
Treasury yields rise as global bond markets react to Bank of Japan move
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to about 4.15% as investors reacted to the Bank of Japan’s decision to raise interest rates to the highest level since 1995. The move sent ripples through global bond markets and briefly capped gains in equities.Despite higher yields, stocks continued to advance, suggesting investors remain focused on the broader outlook for U.S. rate cuts rather than near-term global tightening.
Wall Street faces weak final trading week despite inflation-driven rebound
Even with today’s gains, U.S. stocks are on track for modest losses in the last full trading week of 2025. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain slightly lower for the week and have struggled in December amid a rotation out of mega-cap tech.Seasonal hopes for a “Santa Claus rally” have faded so far. Still, improving inflation trends and renewed strength in AI-linked stocks could offer late-month support. U.S. markets will remain open on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26, despite federal offices closing under an order from President Trump.
Top gainers today

Tuesday’s rally pushed the S&P 500 to a record close of 6,909.79, keeping momentum intact heading into year-end. Investors are balancing strong economic data with expectations for future interest-rate cuts. The U.S. Commerce Department reported third-quarter GDP growth of 4.3%, well above forecasts. The data briefly reduced hopes for early rate cuts, but futures markets still point to two cuts by the end of 2026, according to CME Group data.
Individual stocks also drove attention. Nike jumped more than 4% after Tim Cook disclosed a personal share purchase. With the New York Stock Exchange closing early on Christmas Eve, investors are watching closely to see if seasonal gains carry markets higher into the new year.
S&P 500 trades near record highs as holiday volumes thin
Early in Wednesday’s shortened session, the S&P 500 hovered just below flat shortly after the opening bell. The Dow rose about 0.2%, while the Nasdaq dipped roughly 0.1%. With many institutional desks lightly staffed ahead of Christmas, trading volumes were muted, amplifying small moves.Despite the calm tape, the benchmark index has gained 1.1% so far this week and is up roughly 17.5% year to date. Investors remain reluctant to fade the rally as breadth slowly improves and cyclical sectors attract fresh interest.
Dow rises while Nasdaq slips as holiday trading stays muted
Trading activity was subdued from the opening bell, reflecting a shortened holiday session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained around 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped about 0.1%. Investors avoided large bets, focusing instead on selective opportunities as liquidity remained thin.So far this week, the S&P 500 is up about 1.1%, pushing its year-to-date gain near 17.5%. The steady climb has reinforced confidence that the market can hold elevated levels into year-end.
Nike jumps as Tim Cook disclosure lifts investor confidence
Nike was among the session’s top performers, jumping more than 4%. The move followed a disclosure that Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, purchased shares of the footwear giant. The news helped revive sentiment around Nike after months of uneven performance.Technology stocks that led Tuesday’s rally were mixed. Nvidia, Alphabet, Broadcom, and Amazon consolidated recent gains, contributing to the Nasdaq’s mild pullback.
Today’s top stock gainers and losers
Top gainers- Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) jumped 38.54% to $15.42 on heavy volume, nearing its 52-week high.
- Dermata Therapeutics (DRMA) surged 23.01% to $2.51, extending a sharp momentum run.
- Repare Therapeutics (RPTX) gained 19.35% to $2.59, supported by strong trading activity.

- Nvidia (NVDA) slipped 0.47% to $188.32 as chip stocks cooled.
- Intel (INTC) declined 1.92% to $35.65 on modest selling pressure.
GDP growth beats forecasts
Investor sentiment was also shaped by fresh economic data. The U.S. Commerce Department reported that third-quarter GDP grew at an annualized rate of 4.3%, well above the 3.2% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The report, delayed by the government shutdown, highlighted stronger-than-expected economic momentum.While the data briefly cooled expectations for early interest-rate cuts, futures markets still point to easing ahead. According to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, traders continue to price in two rate cuts by the end of 2026.
Santa Claus rally optimism builds heading into Christmas
Attention now turns to the Santa Claus rally period, which spans the final five trading days of December and the first two sessions of January. This year, it runs from December 24 through January 5.According to LPL Financial strategist Adam Turnquist, the S&P 500 has historically delivered average gains of 1.3% during this window, with positive returns nearly 80% of the time.

Wall Street’s resilience remains the central theme of the session. The S&P 500 is currently on pace for its sixth year of gains exceeding 15% out of the last seven, a remarkable streak of consistency. While the Nasdaq Composite saw volatility earlier this year due to sweeping tariff implementations in April, it has since rebounded to lead the major averages with a year-to-date gain of over 20%.
While stocks paused near record levels, precious metals continued to surge. Gold and silver futures pushed to fresh all-time highs, extending a powerful year-end rally. Gold is now up roughly 70% in 2025, while silver has gained more than 150%, marking their strongest annual performances in decades.
Despite the strong market performance, expectations for near-term interest rate cuts have faded. Traders now see less than a 15% chance of a rate cut at the next policy meeting, according to futures pricing. Attention remains on the Federal Reserve, with investors debating whether easing could resume later in 2026.
US stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq steady
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 entered Friday's session coming off fresh record highs established during the Christmas Eve shortened session. At the opening bell, the Dow saw a slight dip of approximately 37 points, or 0.08%, settling near 48,693.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite showed marginal gains of roughly 0.09%. This muted activity is typical for the day after Christmas, as many institutional traders remain away, leading to lower-than-average trading volumes. However, the lack of selling pressure suggests that investors are comfortable holding positions as they look toward 2026.
Market leadership throughout 2025 has been driven by technology and industrial sectors, even as interest rate expectations shifted. Earlier in the year, the ""Trump trade"" and tariff concerns briefly pushed the Nasdaq into bear market territory, but corporate earnings and AI-driven growth eventually reclaimed the narrative.
Currently, the S&P 500 sits at 6,937, reflecting an 18% annual rise. Investors are now focused on whether the momentum can carry through the final sessions of the year to lock in these double-digit gains.
Top stocks today
Individual stock stories provided the primary sparks in an otherwise quiet session. Coupang (CPNG) shares jumped over 8% after the South Korean e-commerce giant addressed a massive data breach involving 33 million customers. The company confirmed that a former employee was responsible for the leak and that the data has since been deleted. This resolution provided much-needed relief to shareholders, helping the stock recover from a 17% monthly decline. Similarly, Nike (NKE) saw a boost following a notable insider purchase. Apple CEO Tim Cook, a long-time Nike board member, doubled his stake by purchasing $3 million in shares. This move was interpreted by the market as a significant vote of confidence in CEO Elliott Hill’s ongoing turnaround strategy.In the high-growth sector, NVIDIA (NVDA) continued its steady climb, rising 1.7% to $191.83. Tesla (TSLA) also edged higher, approaching the $490 mark. Not all stocks shared in the gains, however. Companies like Ondas Holdings and Plug Power saw modest declines as investors rotated out of smaller-cap speculative plays. The active trading in these names highlights a market that is still searching for value and growth drivers even as the broader indices remain stationary.
Precious Metals and Energy Prices Surge
While stocks remained calm, the commodities market experienced significant volatility. Gold and silver futures reached fresh all-time highs on Friday, driven by a weakening US dollar and escalating geopolitical tensions. Gold rose over 1% to surpass $4,550 per ounce, while silver continued a rally that has seen the metal gain 150% in 2025. This ""debasement trade"" is largely fueled by concerns over rising global debt and recent military strikes in Nigeria. Additionally, central bank purchases have provided a solid floor for precious metals, making 2025 the best year for gold and silver since 1979.The energy sector is also seeing a sharp upward trend. Crude oil is on track for its largest weekly gain since October, with Brent trading above $62 per barrel. The price hike is linked to a partial US blockade of crude shipments from Venezuela and increased friction in the Middle East and Africa. As the Trump administration applies more pressure on sanctioned tankers, supply concerns are keeping prices elevated. These rising commodity costs represent a potential headwind for the economy in the coming year, though they have yet to derail the current stock market rally.

- Charlotte is horrible to Lulu.
- Neither mother is at fault.
No Good Deed Goes Unpunished
Nina (Cynthia Watros) would do anything for Willow (Katelyn MacMullen). Even though Willow treated Nina horribly before she knew Nina was her mother. Even though Willow treated Nina horribly after she knew Nina was her mother.
Even though Willow treats Nina horribly despite Nina completely supporting her in the custody battle for Wiley and Amelia, and went so far as to offer to pay for a lawyer, as Willow is under suspicion for shooting Drew (Cameron Mathison).

Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder
While Lulu (Alexa Havins) was in a coma, Charlotte (Bluesy Burke) regularly came to sit at her bedside and weep into her elbow. But once Lulu woke up, Charlotte was less loving to her mom. Especially now that they suspect Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) is back in Port Charles, and looking to run off with his little angel.
Charlotte is happy to go on the run with Papa. Lulu who?
READ THIS: Could Willow have a DID twist coming?
Innocent Prey
Willow and Charlotte harbor numerous resentments about how their mothers weren’t there for them during their formative years. And, for some reason, they are blaming their moms. Uhm, Willow, sweetie, Nina was IN A COMA when you were born. Madeline (Donna Mills) stole Willow’s newborn babies and distributed them around the country. Nelle (Chloe Lanier) went to bastard Frank Benson.
Willow was dropped off in the woods with loony Harmony, who raised her daughter in a cult and pimped her out to the leader. Charlotte, for her part, was created from an egg Helena (Constance Towers) stole from Lulu. Valentin stole the resulting embryo, which gestational surrogate Claudette (Bree Williamson) ran off with.
Sure, Nina and Lulu weren’t there for Willow and Charlotte. BUT NONE OF IT WAS THEIR FAULT. And their daughters should take that into consideration.",https://soaphub.com/general-hospital/news-gh/willow-charlotte-apologize-stat/,

For the inquisitive minds and history buffs, Colorado has always possessed an insatiable allure. This is because of its fair share of abandoned mining settlements filled with crumbling buildings and dusty signboards, which have earned the nickname ""ghost towns."" While exploring the state, you can get blissfully lost in Chaffee County's ghost town, St. Elmo, one of the American West's best-preserved historic villages. Alternatively, you can visit Crystal City near Aspen, offering breathtaking mountain and waterfall views. However, if you'd like to witness an abandoned city that has almost completely gone back to nature, set a plan to explore the western reaches of Rocky Mountain National Park, where lies a nearly forgotten chapter of Colorado's mining history: Lulu City.
Lulu City's prospects seemed grand at its inception. According to the sign at the location, 200 people called this remote settlement home at its peak, and almost 40 houses were built for the residents. People moved to the town to mine silver and gold. The townsite also included several sawmills, a hotel for visitors, and a justice of the peace. Sadly, the town's decline happened only within a few years of its establishment. Lulu City was active between 1879 and 1884. Ultimately, harsh winters and mine closures in 1883 left the city almost abandoned. The city's post office was closed down in 1884, and within a year, the settlement was deserted by all.
Planning your visit to this mountain time capsule
The journey to Lulu City begins at Colorado River Trailhead, located on Trail Ridge Road. This trailhead is the main access point to several trails of the northwest corner of Rocky Mountain National Park, a hidden gem for outdoor adventurers. The trailhead is accessible both from the Grand Lake Entrance and the Alpine Visitor Center. Visitors flying into the region typically arrive at Denver International Airport, located approximately 75 miles from the park. Per the National Park Service, Trail Ridge Road typically operates from Memorial Day through mid-October.
Once you reach the Colorado River Trailhead, the Lulu City area is about 3.7 miles away. About a mile before reaching Lulu City, you will come across the Shipler's Cabin area. The hike to Lulu City is generally a leisurely trek that's ideal for completing even with senior family members. The path mostly winds through moist, shady woodland, providing occasional glimpses of Shipler Mountain, especially near the Shipler Mine remnants. As you hike through, the trail remains wide and relatively flat for most of the journey. At the site of Lulu City, you'll discover a sign that documents the years the settlement was active and its population. While the site does not have any markers of human existence apart from a few wooden logs, the area is perfect to spend a day immersed in nature and appreciate the grandeur of the towering aspen trees all around.
Exploring Colorado River Trailhead and where to stay
After crossing Lulu City, if you're looking for a more challenging hike, follow a short, steep trail about 3 miles farther to Little Yellowstone Canyon, where sweeping views of the Colorado River valley unfold. Experienced travelers also recommend visiting Thunder Pass in the Never Summer Range while exploring the Colorado River Trail. From the top of the Thunder Pass, you can take in panoramic views of Rocky Mountain National Park and the breathtaking Never Summer Range, making the ascent truly rewarding.
To stay longer on this side of Rocky Mountain National Park, you can choose one of the accommodations near Grand Lake. One of the most popular stays is the historic Grand Lake Lodge, which has welcomed guests for over a century and offers a majestic view of the body of water. Additionally, the lodge's Mountainside Bungalows are also pet-friendly, so you can travel with your furry companions without having to worry about stringent hotel rules. However, dogs are not allowed on trails in Rocky Mountain National Park. Another highly-rated option for your stay is the Western Riviera Lakeside Lodging, which offers motel-style rooms overlooking the lake with stunning mountain scenery, located within walking distance of restaurants and shops.
When you're taking a break from outdoor adventures, the eclectic dining scene near Grand Lake will satiate your taste buds. You'll find everything from refined cuisine at The Historic Rapids Restaurant to laid-back comfort fare at local favorites. Among the top-rated spots on TripAdvisor, Sagebrush BBQ & Grill has been a beloved staple for over two decades, serving hearty ribs, juicy steaks, and its signature sweet cornbread. Nearby, One Love Rum Kitchen brings a touch of the tropics to the Rockies with its Caribbean-inspired cocktails and island-style dishes.",https://www.islands.com/2037323/lulu-city-colorado-enchanting-ghost-village-secret-boomtown-once-thriving-rocky-mountain-national-park/,

A Sudanese paramilitary commander, whose role in the el-Fasher massacre was revealed by BBC Verify, has been sanctioned by the UK government.
Brig Gen Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris, also known as Abu Lulu, was filmed shooting dead at least 10 unarmed captives after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city in late October.
Thousands of people are believed to have been killed by the RSF after the army withdrew from el-Fasher. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the atrocities taking place in Sudan were ""a scar on the conscience of the world"" which ""cannot, and will not, go unpunished.""
The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.
Dagalo, who was also placed under EU sanctions in November, was shown in verified footage touring an army base in the city in the hours after el-Fasher fell. He is the brother of RSF chief Mohamed ""Hemedti"" Dagalo.
Sudan's civil war - sparked after the RSF and the military's fragile ruling coalition collapsed - has now raged for more than two years, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions more.
El-Fasher was the army's last major foothold in Darfur, the traditional stronghold of the RSF paramilitary.
An investigation by BBC Verify revealed the brutal tactics used by the RSF during the protracted siege, which included detaining and torturing people trying to smuggle supplies into the city and building a massive sand barrier around it to prevent civilians and army troops from escaping.
In its statement announcing the sanctions, the UK foreign office said it believed that Abu Lulu was ""responsible for violence against individuals based on ethnicity and religion, and the deliberate targeting of civilians"".
Footage confirmed by BBC Verify in October showed Abu Lulu executing several unarmed captives with an AK-style rifle in a sandy, dusty area north-west of the city. RSF troops who witnessed the incidents were later seen celebrating their commander's actions.
UK officials accused Abu Lulu, Dagalo, Gedo Hamdan Ahmed and Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed of carrying out ""heinous"" acts of violence, including mass killings, systematic sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians. The men have been placed under travel bans and any assets they hold will be frozen.
""Today's sanctions against RSF commanders strike directly at those with blood on their hands, while our strengthened aid package will deliver lifesaving support to those suffering,"" Cooper said.
Citing satellite images - previously published by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab - the foreign office said piles of bodies and mass graves could be seen in el-Fasher after the massacre.
Cooper also pledged an additional £21m to provide food, shelter and health services for civilians impacted by fighting in remote areas.
In the days that followed the el-Fasher massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed ""Hemedti"" Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed ""violations"" and said the incidents would be investigated.
Among those arrested was Abu Lulu. In a carefully choreographed and edited video posted on the RSF's official Telegram account he is shown being led into a cell at a prison, which was geolocated by BBC Verify to the outskirts of el-Fasher.
The commander, who previously featured heavily in propaganda videos posted online, has not been seen since his arrest. A TikTok account that documented his activities was removed by the company in October after BBC Verify approached the tech giant for comment.
The UK's move comes just two days after the US announced its own set of sanctions against a network of companies and individuals it accused of recruiting former Colombian soldiers and training individuals to fight in Sudan's civil war.
The US Treasury Department said that hundreds of Colombian mercenaries have travelled to Sudan since 2024, including to serve as infantry and drone pilots for the RSF.
Last month, US President Donald Trump pledged to ""start working on Sudan"" alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, posting on social media that ""tremendous atrocities"" were taking place.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jeeq6xnvpo,

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.
That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.
Also, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

A rotation out of tech stocks helped boost the index, as financial services stocks got a lift in Thursday's trading.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.
Meanwhile, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI, allow use of copyrighted characters in generated video
The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is set to invest $1 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and enable users of the AI developer's ""Sora"" video generation platform to use Disney's copyrighted characters in their videos.
Shares in Disney traded up by around 0.2% in premarket trading on the news.
The partnership makes Disney the ""first major content licensing partner on Sora,"" according to a press release from Disney announcing the investment. The three-year licensing agreement will allow Sora users to pull from hundreds of copyrighted Disney characters for use in generated video, including those from franchises such as Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar.
At the same time, Disney is set to ""become a major customer of OpenAI, using its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+, and deploying ChatGPT for its employees,"" according to the press release.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

The blue-chip index gained 1%, or over 450 points, in late morning trading, diverging from the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which lost 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which slid 1%.
A rotation out of tech stocks helped boost the index, as financial services stocks got a lift in Thursday's trading.
Goldman Sachs (GS), the Dow's largest component by weight, rose 1.8%. Dow component American Express (AXP) tacked on 1.7%, while Visa (V) climbed 4%.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.
Meanwhile, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI, allow use of copyrighted characters in generated video
The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is set to invest $1 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and enable users of the AI developer's ""Sora"" video generation platform to use Disney's copyrighted characters in their videos.
Shares in Disney traded up by around 0.2% in premarket trading on the news.
The partnership makes Disney the ""first major content licensing partner on Sora,"" according to a press release from Disney announcing the investment. The three-year licensing agreement will allow Sora users to pull from hundreds of copyrighted Disney characters for use in generated video, including those from franchises such as Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar.
At the same time, Disney is set to ""become a major customer of OpenAI, using its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+, and deploying ChatGPT for its employees,"" according to the press release.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.
That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

Dow on track for record high as S&P 500, Nasdaq sink
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier index in Thursday's tech stock-led downdraft and was on track to close above its closing record high of 48,254.
The blue-chip index gained 1%, or over 450 points, in late morning trading, diverging from the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which lost 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which slid 1%.
A rotation out of tech stocks helped boost the index, as financial services stocks got a lift in Thursday's trading.
Goldman Sachs (GS), the Dow's largest component by weight, rose 1.8%. Dow component American Express (AXP) tacked on 1.7%, while Visa (V) climbed 4%.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.
Meanwhile, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI, allow use of copyrighted characters in generated video
The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is set to invest $1 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and enable users of the AI developer's ""Sora"" video generation platform to use Disney's copyrighted characters in their videos.
Shares in Disney traded up by around 0.2% in premarket trading on the news.
The partnership makes Disney the ""first major content licensing partner on Sora,"" according to a press release from Disney announcing the investment. The three-year licensing agreement will allow Sora users to pull from hundreds of copyrighted Disney characters for use in generated video, including those from franchises such as Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar.
At the same time, Disney is set to ""become a major customer of OpenAI, using its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+, and deploying ChatGPT for its employees,"" according to the press release.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) is a Canadian apparel retailer whose shares are down by 43% year-to-date. The firm has been the focus of several analysts’ attention in December. For instance, on December 12th, Stifel raised the share price target to $210 from $205 and kept a Hold rating on the shares. In its note, the financial firm discussed that Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU)’s sales in America dipped by 5% in its third fiscal quarter, which marked a two percentage point acceleration over the previous quarter. Stifel added that the retailer was facing trouble with customer loyalty and overall competition. Stifel was joined by BofA, which raised Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU)’s price target to $220 from $185 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The bank pointed out that the retailer was spending slightly more than expected to drive traffic during the fourth quarter. Another price target bump for Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) came on the 12th as Truist increased the target to $200 from $170 and kept a Hold rating. Like Stifel, Truist also pointed towards weak sales in the American region and added that revenue growth came through China sales. Cramer briefly discussed Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) and called it challenged:

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.
That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.

Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LULU. lululemon athletica inc.'s share was trading at $184.18 as of November 28th.

lululemon athletica inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, distributes, and retails technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories for women and men under the lululemon brand in the United States and internationally. Lululemon Athletica’s 65% decline from peak valuations has created a distressed setup in an otherwise premium, long-term compounding business.
Despite cyclical pressures and a sharp slowdown from historic 30–40% growth to just 10% YoY, the company’s fundamentals remain resilient, with revenue rising from $0.1B in 2007 to $10.9B LTM and profitability anchored by 59% gross margins and 23% operating margins. The brand’s global strength, community-driven model, and product innovation continue to differentiate it in a competitive landscape dominated by Nike, Adidas, and fast-growing DTC challengers.
Lululemon’s diversification across stores, e-commerce, and interactive fitness, coupled with a broadening product portfolio, gives it multiple avenues for recovery. International markets—particularly China and Europe—represent meaningful whitespace, while the underpenetrated men’s segment and early-stage footwear line provide multi-year expansion potential.
Near-term risks, including elevated inventory of $1.7B, slower inventory turns, and macro-driven discretionary spending softness, have fueled negative sentiment and contributed to the valuation reset. Yet the company’s strong cash generation ($1.9B operating cash flow), clean balance sheet, and proven ability to scale margins through disciplined execution provide downside protection.
If inventory normalizes and growth reaccelerates via international traction and product category expansion, significant re-rating potential exists, with upside of 50–150% depending on growth outcomes and multiple recovery. While growth may continue decelerating before stabilizing, the current selloff appears to reflect excessive pessimism relative to Lululemon’s structural strengths. For long-term investors, this presents an attractive entry point with an asymmetric risk/reward profile, provided they can look through near-term volatility and adopt a staged accumulation approach.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemon-athletica-inc-lulu-bull-164307380.html,

(LULU) operates as a lifestyle-inspired athletic apparel company specializing in yoga, running, training, and other active pursuits. With a market cap of $21.6 billion, Lululemon is renowned for the comfort of its clothing and its ability to create transformative products and experiences.
Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as ""large-cap stocks."" Lululemon fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the activewear industry.
However, it's not all rainbows and sunshine. LULU stock has tanked 56.9% from its 52-week high of $423.32 touched on Jan. 30. Meanwhile, the stock has declined 8.2% over the past three months, compared to the Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 9.1% surge during the same time frame.
Lululemon’s performance has remained grim over the longer term as well. LULU stock prices have plummeted 52.3% on a YTD basis and 46.5% over the past 52 weeks, compared to the Nasdaq’s 21.5% gains in 2025 and 20.4% returns over the past year.
LULU stock has remained mostly below its 50-day moving average since mid-February and below its 200-day moving average since late March, underscoring its bearish trend.
Lululemon Athletica’s stock prices plunged 18.6% in a single trading session following the release of its Q2 results on Sept. 4. While the company’s international sales soared 22% year-over-year, its Americas net revenues inched up by a modest 1%. Further, its comparable sales in the Americas dropped by 4% compared to the year-ago quarter. Overall, the company’s net revenues increased 6.5% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, missing the consensus estimates by 36 bps. Meanwhile, its EPS dropped 1.6% year-over-year to $3.10, but surpassed the consensus estimates by a notable margin.
Meanwhile, LULU has notably underperformed its peer, Adidas AG’s (ADDYY) 23.4% decline on a YTD basis and 24.4% plunge over the past year.
Among the 30 analysts covering the LULU stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” Its mean price target of $185.88 suggests a 2% upside potential from current price levels.

Should You Buy the Dip Here in Hopes of Gains to Come?,0,,,"Activist investing heavyweight Elliott Investment Management just made a bold bet, acquiring a $1 billion stake in Lululemon (LULU). The firm's involvement, coupled with the abrupt departure of CEO Calvin McDonald, has investors wondering whether this marks the beginning of a genuine turnaround or the start of a painful restructuring.
LULU stock surged around 10% last week following the news of McDonald's exit. Yesterday, it rose more than 3% after Elliott disclosed a $1 billion investment in the athleisure giant. Lululemon reported a 2% decline in its core market amid competition from startups including Vuori and Alo Yoga.
Moreover, tariff-related headwinds impacted the bottom line by $210 million. Alternatively, strong demand from China helped Lululemon grow international sales by 33% year-over-year (YoY).
Elliott has a mixed track record with retail turnarounds. However, LULU stockholders should be prepared for strategic changes given the activist investor’s involvement. Elliott has already roped in former Ralph Lauren (RL) CFO Jane Nielsen to the table as a potential CEO candidate. This indicates a plan to push for operational improvements and possible portfolio restructuring.
Despite the ongoing rally, LULU stock is down almost 60% from its all-time high. Let’s see if the retail company is a good buy in December 2025.
Should You Buy the Dip in Lululemon Stock?
Lululemon faces a critical inflection point as it navigates mounting challenges in its largest market amid leadership transitions. In fiscal Q3 of 2026, the athletic apparel maker reported revenue of $2.57 billion, up 7% year-over-year (YoY).
While revenue from the Americas fell 2%, comparable sales were down 5% YoY. The company management expects sluggish sales to persist through the crucial holiday quarter.
The company projects fourth-quarter revenue between $3.5 billion and $3.59 billion, down almost 3% from the year-ago period. Additionally, it projects the operating margin to compress by 680 basis points in fiscal Q4. Tariffs and the elimination of duty-free shipping exemptions account for 410 basis points of that pressure, creating a structural headwind that won't disappear quickly.
Lululemon’s management outlines a recovery plan focused on product creation, activation, and enterprise efficiency. This strategy aims to increase new-style penetration to 35% by spring while reducing product development cycles from 18 months to 12 months.
Recent launches, including Milemaker and Shake It Out, have generated positive guest response, though not enough to offset weakness in legacy franchises, which have lost their novelty among high-value customers. Notably, revenue from Mainland China rose 46%, while comparable sales in the country surged by 25% due to strong outerwear performance and successful platform activations.
Management now expects full-year China growth at or above the high end of its 20%-25% guidance range. The geographic divergence highlights opportunity and risk, as Lululemon could depend on international expansion to offset domestic headwinds.
Lululemon ended Q3 with $1 billion in cash and zero balance sheet debt. Its gross margin contracted 290 basis points in Q3 due to tariff impacts and higher markdowns. It expects gross margin to decline approximately 270 basis points for the full year, with pressure intensifying in the fourth quarter.
Management indicated that negative factors will likely outweigh positives as the company enters its first full year under heightened tariff rates. The path to margin recovery appears to be a multi-year journey rather than a near-term achievement.
Is LULU Stock Undervalued?
Analysts tracking LULU stock forecast revenue to rise from $10.6 billion in fiscal 2025 to $14 billion in fiscal 2030. In this period, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $14.6 per share to $19.5 per share.
Today, LULU stock is trading at 17.7x forward earnings, below its three-year average of 24.6x. If Lululemon stock continues to trade at 18x earnings, it will be priced at $351 in late 2028, indicating an upside potential of 63% from current levels.
Out of the 30 analysts covering LULU stock, three recommend “Strong Buy,” 25 recommend “Hold,” one recommends “Moderate Sell,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average LULU stock price target is $204.35, which is below the current price of $210.

9581aeed881e3d6a2e9c4f3d88fb3f37,LULU,,2025-12-08T16:04:21Z,news,news_article,,news,"Down 51.9% YTD, Is Lululemon Stock a Buy Ahead of December 11?",0,,,"2025, so far, has been a painful year for shareholders of Lululemon Athletica (LULU). The stock has tumbled 51.9% year-to-date, a steep decline that reflects not only slowing U.S. sales, but also a shifting landscape across the entire athletic apparel space. Consumers have grown cautious about discretionary spending, especially in performance wear, and Lululemon has struggled to keep up with changing tastes.
During the last earnings call, Lululemon’s management said that its products, which once set trends, are now seen as predictable, with new casual and social pieces failing to excite shoppers. Customer visits and purchase frequency have slowed, a sign that the product pipeline isn’t delivering the same spark it used to.
External pressures have compounded the problem. Competition from both premium rivals and emerging challengers has intensified, and tariff changes have weighed on profitability. A significant share of Lululemon’s U.S. online orders is fulfilled from Canada, previously shielded by the $800 de minimis threshold. With that protection eliminated, Lululemon’s margins came under significant pressure.
However, LULU stock is gaining positive momentum ahead of its Q3 earnings on Dec. 11. LULU stock has gained about 10.7% over the past month. Despite this recent uptick, investors should remain cautious. Historically, Lululemon shares have declined following earnings announcements in each of the last three quarters. Currently, options traders are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of around 10.1% in either direction, which is below the stock’s average four-quarter movement of 17.1%.
Lululemon Faces Slower Growth and Margin Pressure in Q3
Lululemon’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect ongoing challenges, as the company navigates cost pressures and slowing demand. Management is working to offset these headwinds through pricing adjustments, vendor negotiations, and cost-cutting initiatives, but these measures will likely take time to boost its financials.
Revenue growth is anticipated to slow sequentially. Lululemon projects Q3 revenue in the range of $2.47 billion to $2.5 billion, representing a 3% to 4% increase year-over-year. This marks a deceleration compared to the 7% growth the company delivered in the first half of fiscal 2025. While new store openings may provide some support, lingering softness in the U.S. market could weigh on overall sales.
Lululemon’s margins are expected to remain under pressure. Gross margin for the quarter is projected to decline roughly 410 basis points compared with Q3 2024, driven primarily by higher tariffs, the removal of the de minimis exemption, and continued investment in its distribution center project. The combined impact of tariffs and the de minimis exemption is estimated to reduce margins by about 230 basis points. Additionally, markdowns due to seasonal clearance activity could further squeeze profitability.
As a result, Lululemon’s management expects third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $2.18 to $2.23, reflecting a 22% to 24% decline compared with the prior year. Analysts currently forecast EPS of $2.22 for the quarter, down 22.7% year-over-year. Despite these near-term headwinds, Lululemon has a history of surpassing expectations, having exceeded analysts’ EPS forecasts in the last four consecutive quarters.
Is Lululemon Stock a Buy Now?
Lululemon stock has taken a significant hit so far this year, which has driven its earnings multiple lower. LULU stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.2x. Historically, this looks like a bargain for a company that has delivered impressive growth in the past and has one of the most powerful brands in activewear.
However, demand in North America, particularly in the U.S., has softened for Lululemon, and rising costs are putting pressure on the company’s profitability. These headwinds, along with increasing competition, suggest that LULU stock is unlikely to register a quick rebound. Reflecting this cautious sentiment, Wall Street analysts are maintaining a “Hold” consensus rating on Lululemon shares ahead of earnings.

Mind you, he's more than worth the effort, and we can tell you everything you need to know, from how to unlock him to the moves that he has.
If you want to see where Lulu ranks among all of the other units, make sure you stop by our Universal Tower Defense tier list, where we also rank all of the Universal Tower Defense traits, so you know which ones to equip your units with.
Here's everything you need to know about Universal Tower Defense's Lulu:
Who is Universal Tower Defense's Lulu?
Lulu is a secret unit, and he's quite a powerful one at that. While other secret units may require you roll for them and hope you get lucky, there are actually specific steps you need to take to unlock Lulu. The good news is that you know you can get him; the bad news is that you need to go on a series of quests in the late game to do so. Still, it's nice to have a strong unit that isn't all up to chance.
How do I unlock Universal Tower Defense's Lulu?
To unlock Lulu, you need to complete the Power of Kings quest, which may sound simple enough on the surface, but you need to be level 30 before you can embark on this mission, so it takes some time before you can attempt it. After you claim the quest in the quest tab, you need to find an NPC in the lobby with a red symbol over their head - the NPC can be different for each player, so you just need to search for the symbol rather than a specific NPC.
After speaking with the NPC, you need to head to Story and play any level from their map, then, while in the level, you need to complete the chess game you find there. After you do this, you need to go and speak with the Mysterious Witch NPC; she's near the rewards station, standing in front of the AFK World. She gives you an additional three quests to complete:
- Defeat 15 bosses
- Clear 80 waves
- Upgrade 75 relics
After you do those quests, you get one final mission, and that's to summon 5k units in any game mode you like. You can do this across all of them for a bit of variety, or hone in on easy maps to speed things up. After you do this, head to the Power of Kings mission in the quest tab, and you can finally add Lulu to your arsenal.
What are Universal Tower Defense Lulu's moves?
Lulu is a bit more unique than other units, as rather than going on the offensive and attacking enemies himself, he takes a support role. As such, he can give orders to other units, as well as give commands to his enemies. Lulu is very powerful, and you should absolutely consider summoning him. His moves are as follows:
- Retreat! - enemies walk backwards for 40% of the time that they are within Lulu's range
- Beam! - Lulu summons the Shinhira, and they deal 100% to all enemies that are currently in front of Lulu
- Stand Still - enemies can bump into each other, and the command stuns them for four seconds
- Attack! - enemies collide into each other and walk backwards for two seconds
- Absolute Control! - whatever your current order is applies to every enemy across the entire map, not just those near Lulu
What is the best trait for Universal Tower Defense's Lulu?
There are a couple of traits that are good for Lulu, but, considering how powerful he is, we recommend you go for the Sacred trait, as it cuts the cost of summoning him by 15%, meaning you can get Lulu on the battlefield much faster, while also being able to spend less when upgrading him. The Sacred trait has an extremely low roll chance, however, so make sure you check out our Universal Tower Defense codes guide to get all the free rolls you can.",https://www.pockettactics.com/universal-tower-defense-lulu,

Lululemon jumped by 9.60 percent on Friday to close at $204.97 apiece as investors cheered a flurry of developments, including an upbeat outlook, buyback program, and key leadership changes in the company.
In its earnings call on the same day, Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) said that it expects revenues for the full year to be in the range of $10.962 billion to $11.047 billion, or an implied growth of 4 to 6 percent year-on-year.
It also projects diluted earnings per share to be at $12.92 to $13.02.

For the fourth quarter alone, revenues are targeted at $3.5 billion to $3.585 billion, with diluted EPS of $4.66 to $4.76.
The outlook followed Lululemon Athletica Inc.’s (NASDAQ:LULU) earnings performance in the third quarter of the year, where it narrowed its net income by 12.8 percent to $306.8 million from $351.87 million in the same period last year.
Net revenues, on the other hand, increased by 7 percent to $2.56 billion from $2.4 billion year-on-year.
In other developments, Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) said that it is currently in search for the next CEO after Calvin McDonald announced plans to step down from his post and as a member of the Board of Directors effective January 31, 2026.
In the meantime, incumbent Chief Finance Officer Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini would serve as co-CEOs.
The company also expanded the role of Marti Morfitt as the new executive chairman, in addition to being the chairman of the board, effective immediately.
Also on Friday, the listed firm announced plans to repurchase $1 billion worth of its shares in a bid to provide greater value to its shareholders.

And Should You Be, Too?",0,,,"Michael Burry is an investor who isn’t afraid to take a long position, even when it appears to be contrarian to the rest of the market. He was the investor who, starting in 2005, identified the risky nature of the subprime mortgage market. He bet against the market and made millions in selling credit default swaps when the housing bubble popped in 2008. His now-famous bet inspired the movie, “The Big Short,” which went on to win an Academy Award.
Burry recently closed down his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, which frees him from SEC rules that prevent fund managers from talking about specific stocks. And he’s using his newly found freedom on Substack and his new product, “Cassandra Unchained,” to dole out investing advice and share his unique investing style.
“This is a great time of year to find great companies being sold down too far as a result of window dressing and tax-loss harvesting,” he wrote. “Many managers do not like to show they have owned big losers at the end of the year. I, on the other hand, do not mind at all.”
One of the names on Burry’s list is the beaten-down apparel company, Lululemon Athletica (LULU). Despite being down more than 50% this year, Burry says that LULU stock is “at minimum” a hold for the next three to five years.
About Lululemon Stock
Based in Vancouver, Canada, Lululemon makes athletic apparel that is primarily targeted toward women and girls. Its lineup includes fitness pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for yoga, training, and running. The company also offers men’s clothing, as well as accessories such as yoga mats and instructional DVDs, water bottles, bags, and other equipment. It currently has a market capitalization of $21.6 billion.
As mentioned before, shares are sagging this year, down 52% on a year-to-date basis, which is disappointing considering the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) is up 17%. It also trails the overall consumer discretionary sector, which is up 5% this year.
The stock is currently trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 12.4x, which is far below its five-year mean of 46.8x. This indicates that LULU stock is exceptionally cheap right now, as the stock price is falling faster than earnings.
Lululemon Beats on Earnings
Lululemon enjoyed a better-than-expected performance for its fiscal second quarter, which ended Aug. 3. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 6% from a year ago, with the company seeing strong sales from its international segment (up 22%) to offset 1% growth in its Americas segment.
Earnings per share of $3.10 were down $0.05 from a year ago, but still beat analysts’ expectations of $2.84.
“In the second quarter, we exceeded expectations on EPS, but revenue fell short of our guidance, driven predominantly by our U.S. business,” Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said. “We are also navigating industry-wide challenges, including higher tariff rates. In light of these dynamics, we are revising our full-year outlook. As we begin the back half of the year, our brand and balance sheet remain strong, and we will continue to exercise financial discipline and strategically invest in our growth potential.”
Q3 guidance calls for revenue between $2.47 billion and $2.5 billion, which would be growth between 3% and 4%. The company is expecting EPS between $2.18 and $2.23 in the quarter. Full-year guidance includes revenue between $10.85 billion and $11 billion, with EPS in a range of $12.77 to $12.97. Management said its guidance reflects a reduction of $240 million in gross profits.
Earnings for the third quarter will be announced after the closing bell on Dec. 11.
What Do Analysts Expect for LULU Stock?
Analysts largely agree with Burry call to hold Lululemon, as the overwhelming sentiment is to hold LULU stock. Of 30 analysts who cover Lululemon, 24 suggest holding; three have “Buy” ratings and three have “Sell” ratings.
The median price target of $185 is very close to where Lululemon trades now, although a high target of $303 suggests potential upside of 67%. On the other hand, a low target of $120 warns of a 33% decline.
Lululemon has a tough task this year, considering the tariff woes facing the U.S. and Canada, and there doesn’t seem to be any hope of that changing soon. However, as Burry points out, LULU stock is more of a long-term hold, and considering the stock is undervalued today, there seems to be reasonable potential that it will turn around on Burry’s timeline.

LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 20 updatesBroadcom results highlight fears over profitability of AI hardware sellers
Google's (GOOG) chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO) posted quarterly results after the bell that broadly beat Wall Street's expectations as orders from leading AI developer Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) surged to $21 billion. But profitability concerns are driving the stock down, analysts said Friday.
Historically, most semiconductor makers operated like commodity businesses, as products were relatively undifferentiated, competition was intense, and profit margins were thin.
The emergence of AI chips changed that dynamic. A small number of companies — particularly Nvidia (NVDA) — control the market with highly specialized chips that are in exceptionally high demand and short supply, allowing them to command premium prices and earn unusually high margins.
But as more competitors enter the AI chip market and supply increases, some analysts worry that the economics could eventually start to resemble traditional semiconductor markets again, where chips behave more like commodities, companies' pricing power weakens, and their profits decline.
""While all of these AI revenue figures are surging higher, the cost of this growth comes on margins..."" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore of Broadcom's results in a note to clients Friday.
Broadcom guided for a gross margin of 76.9% for the current (January) quarter, which would mark a decline from 79% in the year-ago period. It would also be a step down from 77.9% in the fourth quarter and 78.3% in the third quarter — although these figures still represent extremely high profitability.
Particularly, investors are worried Broadcom's additional $11 billion worth of orders from AI developer Anthropic for server racks equipped with Google's TPUs will have lower margins due to high pass-through costs (Broadcom is passing its manufacturing costs for the TPUs directly to Anthropic, without adding any markup or earning a profit on the orders).
Wall Street remains bullish on Broadcom, overall.
BNB Paribas analyst Karl Ackerman called the profitability worries ""shortsighted"" as ""Broadcom’s transition to becoming a systems supplier should unlock a much bigger content opportunity.""
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also maintained bullish sentiment on the stock despite the selloff, which he attributed to broader ""AI stock angst.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.
That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.
Also, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

Dow on track for record high as S&P 500, Nasdaq sink

The blue-chip index gained 1%, or over 450 points, in late morning trading, diverging from the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which lost 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which slid 1%.
A rotation out of tech stocks helped boost the index, as financial services stocks got a lift in Thursday's trading.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.
Meanwhile, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

The company, based in Vancouver, Canada, said that McDonald and the board are working together to manage a “smooth transition,” and he will serve as a senior advisor to the company through March 31, 2026.
The board said it was conducting a comprehensive search in partnership with a leading executive search firm to select his successor. McDonald took the helm in 2018.
Lululemon said Marti Morfitt, the board's chair, will take on the expanded role of executive chair, effective immediately, to “ensure the continued execution of the company’s near- and long-term growth strategy during the leadership transition.”
In addition, Meghan Frank, chief financial officer, and André Maestrini, chief commercial officer, will serve as interim co-CEOs following McDonald’s exit, the company said.
Lululemon's stock price rose 11% in early trading on Friday.
The announcement came alongside Lululemon's third-quarter results, which showed continued malaise in the U.S. Net revenue in the Americas declined 2%, while international revenue increased 33%.
Quarterly profit dropped 13%.
Lululemon has been wrestling with a host of problems such as higher costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs to stiffer competition from the likes of Alo Yoga. The brand is known for its simple workout sets worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber. Meanwhile, Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson has been an outspoken critic of the company's direction.
“The perfect pose that the brand used to execute with ease has given way to a much scrappier posture that has been present for quite some time, ” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note published on Thursday.
Saunders noted that Lululemon faces three problems: The market for athleisure is weaker than it was, while the competition is “more intense and of a higher caliber.” He also said that against this backdrop Lululemon's execution has faltered.
He noted that Wilson's criticism of the company made it difficult for McDonald, and he believes that is one of the reasons for his exit.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.

Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

Dow on track for record high as S&P 500, Nasdaq sink

The blue-chip index gained 1%, or over 450 points, in late morning trading, diverging from the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which lost 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which slid 1%.
A rotation out of tech stocks helped boost the index, as financial services stocks got a lift in Thursday's trading.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.

Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI, allow use of copyrighted characters in generated video
The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is set to invest $1 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and enable users of the AI developer's ""Sora"" video generation platform to use Disney's copyrighted characters in their videos.
Shares in Disney traded up by around 0.2% in premarket trading on the news.
The partnership makes Disney the ""first major content licensing partner on Sora,"" according to a press release from Disney announcing the investment. The three-year licensing agreement will allow Sora users to pull from hundreds of copyrighted Disney characters for use in generated video, including those from franchises such as Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar.
At the same time, Disney is set to ""become a major customer of OpenAI, using its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+, and deploying ChatGPT for its employees,"" according to the press release.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

Before that, Sarina reported and edited for the business and real estate sections of amNewYork. Learn about our editorial policies Published December 12, 2025 02:03 PM EST Lululemon has launched a search for its next CEO. Sebastian Ng / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald is departing at the same time as its search for his replacement.The process irked Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson—who, along with analysts, expressed optimism about bringing on fresh leadership. Lululemon's once high-flying stock has plummeted this year. Now a new CEO will be brought in to help coach the athleisure brand through its recovery. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) said Thursday that Calvin McDonald’s roughly eight-year tenure will conclude at the end of January. The transition process is unfolding in a somewhat dramatic manner, with the company announcing a search rather than immediately naming a permanent replacement, and founder Dennis “Chip” Wilson publicly grousing about what he sees as insufficient planning. ""As one of the largest active shareholders of Lululemon, I am deeply concerned about what appears to be a tremendous failure by the Board to competently plan for the future and manage an effective succession process,” Wilson said in a Friday statement. Wilson, who was listed as owning more than 8% of the company's stock in an August regulatory filing, said the company's ""premium brand value"" has eroded and the board ""does not understand its target customers anymore or what will drive shareholder value.” Lululemon didn’t respond to Investopedia’s questions in time for publication. Why This News Matters A number of retailers, from Walmart to Target to Nike, were ready to name a successor when their CEO announced a retirement date. The lack of a successor may make some investors think Lululemon's path forward is less certain. Wilson has been a critic of the company before, in early 2024 telling Forbes that the company was ""trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody,” and suggesting that ""You’ve got to be clear that you don’t want certain customers coming in.” A new CEO could end Wilson's vocal complaints about the company's direction, which were ""becoming a growing distraction,"" William Blair said. ""Management has indicated it is looking for someone with growth and restructuring experience, who likely benefits in taking over following some initial improvement,"" the analysts said in a research note Friday. Lululemon hopes to improve its U.S. performance, where revenue fell 3% year-over-year last quarter, by ramping up new merchandise. The company wants fresh styles to account for 35% of merchandise in spring, and a quicker design process to fuel innovation, CFO Meghan Frank said on a conference call Thursday. Related Education Succession: What It is, How It Works, Examples Lululemon Says It's Tackling 'Newness' Issues. The Economy Isn't Cooperating. “We've let product life cycles run too long within some of our key franchises,” Frank said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense, recalling comments the company made earlier this year about a need for ""newness"" on its shelves. Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs throughout the search process, and Wilson will advise the company through the end of March, Lululemon said. Lululemon’s stock began climbing after the company announced McDonald’s departure and released better-than-expected results Thursday evening. Shares were recently up 10%, but remain nearly 50% below where they were a year ago. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Learn about our editorial policies Published December 18, 2025 02:01 PM EST Elliott Investment Management has a CEO candidate in mind for Lululemon. Cheng Xin / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways The activist investment group Elliott thinks the former Ralph Lauren CFO Jane Nielsen would be a strong candidate for CEO at Lululemon Athletica.The retailer hasn't commented on the idea, but investors appear to have embraced the suggestion. Lululemon needs a new CEO. One investor's preferred candidate might not be a a stretch. Less than a week has passed since Lululemon announced it was seeking a CEO, and one of its biggest stakeholders is already floating a candidate who—based on the market's reaction—seems to appeal to fellow investors: Jane Nielsen, who contributed to turnarounds at Ralph Lauren (RL) and Coach, now part of Tapestry (TPR). Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has put forward Nielsen, the notion which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Elliott has acquired a more than $1 billion stake in the retailer, according to a person familiar with the matter, giving it sway in a company with a market value of about $25 billion. Why This News Matters to Investors Elliott Investment Management has a record of influencing companies, including working with PepsiCo to reduce some prices and shifting the board at Southwest Airlines. Elliott has built up a stake in several companies and owns Barnes & Nobel. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) didn't respond to a request for comment in time for publication. But investors appear to be considering the involvement of Elliott—and its pick of Nielsen, previously CFO at Ralph Lauren and now a board member at Mondelēz International (MDLZ)—warmly: Company shares were recently up more than 4%. (They remain down more than 40% this year, part of why a new chief is needed in the first place.) “Lululemon is one of the most powerful brands in retail, defined by exceptional products, deeply engaged communities and significant global potential,” Nielsen told The Journal. “I would welcome the chance to discuss this opportunity with the Lululemon board."" The Canada-based retailer last week said CEO Calvin McDonald will leave his post at the end of January, and that it was seeking a successor with growth and restructuring experience. The move stood out in a time when a number of other well-known consumer-facing companies, such as Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT) and Nike (NIKE) have named successors without a public search. Related Education Activist Investor Explained: Definition, Role, and Leading Players Turnaround: Definition in Business and Finance, Examples Lululemon's approach didn't sit well with its founder, Dennis “Chip” Wilson, who saw it as a sign of insufficient planning. Wilson has a more than 8% stake in Lululemon. He also has a history of publicizing when he disagrees with the retailer, including voicing concern about Lululemon moving far beyond its yoga-focused roots. He didn't respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. U.S. sales have slowed for the retailer as it broadens its reach. Lululemon, once known for imbuing leggings and sports bras with a sense of luxury, now sells golf and tennis gear, along with men's apparel. Lululemon hopes to revive its American business by rolling out new items this spring and speeding up its design and production process, CFO Meghan Frank said.

US stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points in its final policy decision of the year, while Chair Jerome Powell expressed confidence about the trajectory of inflation and of growth in the US economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 1%, or around 500 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.7%, finishing just below a record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained nearly 0.3%.
The small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) also notched a fresh all-time high.
The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday for the third time this year. But the central bank signaled a slower pace of easing ahead, projecting one more cut for 2026. The decision means the central bank's benchmark interest rate now sits in a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.
The decision drew dissents on both sides. Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid and Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee disagreed with the decision, preferring to hold rates steady. On the other side, Fed governor Stephen Miran pushed to cut rates by a half a percentage point.
In his press conference following the decision, Powell acknowledged the ""tension"" in the central bank's dual mandate. But he suggested that President Trump's tariffs — which he pointed to as the reason for an ""overshoot"" of the Fed's inflation target — were still likely to represent a ""one-time"" price increase. And he touted the US economy's strength, including in AI-related growth.
JPMorgan strategist Stephanie Aliaga told Yahoo Finance there were no ""surprises"" from Powell's press conference.
Meanwhile, tech trade will get a key test Wednesday with an earnings report from Oracle (ORCL), as Wall Street increasingly looks to the cloud firm as one of the proxies for the AI trade. Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) are set for earnings reports on Thursday. Finally, US manufacturer GE Vernova (GEV) shares soared over 15% after doubling its dividend.

The Nottingham Forest defender has collaborated with sustainable brand Sokito to create a custom design named ‘Mr Lulu’, inspired by his nickname.
The light green boot draws from Nigerian culture and iconic Super Eagles kits, featuring hand-drawn wings, leaves and the African continent.
The insole and side of the boot carry the ‘Mr Lulu’ logo, while the footwear incorporates a 100 per cent knit tongue for improved comfort. It is largely plant-based, made with materials including bamboo, corn waste, castor beans and recycled plastic.
Only 1,000 pairs of the Sokito Scudetta ‘Mr Lulu’ boots will be released, concluding an 18-month development process. They will be available online from December 5.
Aina’s off-field creation comes as questions remain over his availability for Forest before the continental tournament.
The fullback has been sidelined since sustaining a hamstring injury in the opening minutes of Nigeria’s 2026 World Cup qualifier against South Africa in September.
He has missed 16 matches across all competitions and was not registered for the Premier League or Europa League squads after the injury, leaving him ineligible to feature for the club until the January transfer window.
Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Premier League fixture against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, Forest manager Sean Dyche confirmed that while Aina is improving, he will not return to club action this year.
“Ola is getting close to fitness, but obviously can’t be with us until January,” Dyche said.
He added that the defender is “back on the grass”, but remains in a “longer-term situation” despite steady progress.
Although he could be physically ready in December, any participation in AFCON would keep him unavailable to Forest until the new year.
Despite the club constraints, Nigeria coach Eric Chelle included Aina in his provisional 54-man squad for the tournament, reinforcing the defender’s importance to the Super Eagles as he pushes towards full fitness.",https://punchng.com/aina-launches-new-boots-for-afcon-2025/,

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.
That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.
Also, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.
Meanwhile, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

But few can compete with lululemon. The Canadian brand has evolved far beyond its signature leggings, becoming our style team's go-to for men’s basics and workout clothes that look as good as they feel. That premium reputation is also why lulu almost never marks down its bestsellers—until now. The brand’s Cyber Monday deals just landed, and this is the first time I’ve seen fan favorites like the State Pullover Hoodie (one of the best we’ve ever tested) actually go on sale.
SHOP LULULEMON'S CYBER MONDAY DEALS
Our style editor Joseph Cheatham raves about the State Pullover's quick-drying-yet cozy fabric. ""Thanks to the brushed interior, you get that next-to-skin warmth that keeps you feeling toasty when the temps dip,"" he wrote in his review of the best hoodies. Plus it's pretty stylish for a hoodie, and looks decent with jeans for my weekend errands. Also on rare discount: the ABC Trouser, one of our favorite chinos. Its proprietary Anti-Ball-Crushing design lives up to the name, using a gusset that eases tension through the crotch and thighs. It’s a staple in our style team’s work uniforms, and its clean cut pairs well with everything from T-shirts to button-ups.
Two other deals worth flagging: the Cityverse Sneaker and the Fast Track Bag. The former is one of lululemon’s most versatile shoes. It's lightweight, cushioned, and sleek enough to wear with joggers or jeans. In fact, the Cityverse has replaced by adidas Sambas as my go-to casual shoe. The Fast Track Bag, meanwhile, is a great grab-and-go option for the gym or office. It has smart internal organization, a sturdy build, and a compact shape that doesn’t feel bulky on your commute.
While there are other great deals today (see: Vuori's Cyber Monday sale), these are some of the best athleisure discounts I’ve seen. And because lululemon rarely marks down its bestsellers, they’ll likely sell out fast. If something catches your eye, grab it now. And keep an eye on this page—we’ll be updating it with more lululemon deals as they drop.

Pei Lulu is the pride of her divorced parents. Her life in Boston is supported by her mother’s salary from a job at Tsinghua University and her father’s business of sculpting Buddhas and dragons for overseas clients. That Lulu has managed to study abroad—at Harvard, no less—is already an achievement. But she’s also particularly dedicated, even among her extraordinary peers. When her wealthy friend Rachel vacations in Newport or goes skiing in Vermont, Lulu is content to stay on campus, reading books in the library. There’s just one problem: she is a history major. All governments have their preferred versions of the past, but some are more totalizing than others. For a young Chinese person, interest in the wrong subject can seriously screw things up.
The year is 2008. Many Chinese people, including those pursuing an education abroad, still carry the self-image of an earnest underdog with much to learn and much to prove. (Lulu couldn’t have conceived that a Presidential decree might one day threaten her spot at Harvard, or question her eligibility for a student visa.) But has there ever been a simple time to be Chinese? A pivotal moment for Lulu arrives when she decides to join a crowd welcoming the visiting Chinese Premier. She feels an obligation to do so “because the delegates, even though we disliked them as officials, were from our motherland.” The mood is jubilant, with hundreds of miniature red flags and smiling young faces, except for one slender middle-aged woman. She is unaccompanied, but she holds a sign suggesting that she isn’t alone: “We Won’t Forget the Tiananmen Square Massacre!” The crowd is repulsed by her presence. A group of students disavow her message (“Nobody believes you!”), question her motive (“Why help Americans demonize our country like this?”), and call her names (“Bitch!” “Cunt!” “Loser!”). Lulu doesn’t participate and worries for the woman’s safety. Still, she uses the first-person plural in describing the crowd’s reaction. We intervene, she narrates, in the same way that we feel obligated to welcome the delegates from the motherland. The little flags, at first a sign of confidence in national identity, now seem to have turned into something else.
Discover the year’s essential reads in fiction and nonfiction.
I caught myself flinching at this scene, not only for the naked, charged confrontation, but also for Ha Jin’s choice to present it as a focal point. Jin left China in 1985 for a graduate program at Brandeis University. The brutal crackdown against student protesters in Tiananmen Square came four years later. In the aftermath, Jin’s decision to publicly support the students’ democratic values apparently cost him the ability to visit his home country. It’s impossible not to see him in the figure of the lonesome protester; he’s likely faced some of the same insults, the same accusations that he’s dredging up the past. “The massacre, if there’d been one,” Lulu thinks to herself, “had taken place almost two decades before, and I was amazed that the woman was still bent on making a protest about it today.” For the author to choose this history as a subject is to insist on examining a long-festering wound of his generation.
Before “Looking for Tank Man,” Jin had published twenty titles in America. Some were poetry, some were essays, but most were works of fiction that dealt with well-educated Chinese who were unhappy with their lives. At first, these characters were situated in the China that Jin had grown up in. Then, starting with Nan Wu in “A Free Life” (2007), they began to migrate to the United States. Nan—like Jin, a graduate student in America who’s shocked by the news from Tiananmen—was followed by a series of characters, in the story collection “A Good Fall” (2009), who are caught between two worlds, navigating hope and disillusionment. And the protagonists in “The Boat Rocker” (2016) and “A Song Everlasting” (2021) are thriving professionals—an expat journalist known for exposés of the Chinese government, a popular opera singer—whose failures to obey the state obstruct their path to an undisturbed, conventionally successful life.
The drama of these stories, in which insiders become outsiders, is evident; displacement promises profound confusion, conflict, discovery, and entanglement. So it goes with Lulu, who, after her encounter with the protester, becomes obsessed with the Tiananmen Square massacre, and enrolls in a course on the subject. It isn’t an easy class. Seeing photos and documents of crushed people, and visiting blood-drenched objects retrieved from the site and preserved in the basement of a Harvard library, Lulu is no longer in doubt of the facts. She turns her investigation toward the students’ intentions. She finds that they were peaceful and law-abiding, advocating for dialogue instead of subverting the political system. (After a portrait of Mao Zedong was vandalized, some even turned in the culprits to the authorities.) Lulu is especially drawn to the famous photograph of the “Tank Man,” who is seen from behind as he impedes a column of armored cars from advancing. Something about this image thrusts her feelings into contradiction. To her staunch nationalist friends, she fiercely defends its place as a global symbol of resistance; at the same time, she can’t stomach a mullet-sporting white guy who displays the photo prominently on his cabinet, as if it’s a poster of a rock star.
A decisive turn arrives when Lulu travels back to China to visit her ailing grandfather, who tells her a secret that’s been withheld for decades: her parents were involved in the protests during the spring of 1989. Her father had worked on the famous “Goddess of Democracy” statue, and her mother was among the first hunger strikers. Once Lulu starts asking questions, her parents don’t put up much of a fight. They still believe in the ideals of freedom and democracy, they say, but they’ve grown deeply skeptical of the reform they once demanded, and of their own sense of agency at the time. Her father feels he was maddened by rage. Her mother feels that she and her peers were “meant to be sacrificed.” Upon learning that Lulu is writing a thesis on what happened, though, she hands over her diary. “I hope it will be useful for your studies,” she says. Lulu’s father’s face twitches, but he encourages her: “You’ve got to do what you have to do. To be controlled by fear is not a way to live.”
As graduation approaches, Lulu ponders her future. On the one hand, she sees the appeal of finding a job in Beijing to be close to her mother, who raised her alone. On the other, she feels she has unfinished business in America, where, ironically, she’s best able to understand the particular history of her home. She is surrounded by adults who counsel her to be pragmatic, but there is little consensus on what that entails. Her dad feels obligated to make money for his new family—an Audi-driving young wife and twin boys preparing to eventually study in America—but wishes he had more integrity as an artist. Lulu’s mom regrets not pursuing a graduate education. She gives her daughter mixed instructions: Lulu ought to secure a good man as soon as possible, but should also stay self-sufficient, never beholden to money, power, or love.
Lulu navigates all this with a delicate maturity, managing her parents’ anxiety without necessarily surrendering to it. She moves to New York for a Ph.D. program at Columbia, which appears to be a haven of multicultural acceptance and intellectual inquiry. Her adviser is a charming cultural historian who used to perform standup in Mandarin; Lulu, whose dissertation is on Tiananmen, takes full advantage of the dedicated East Asian library. This environment stands in stark contrast to her experience at Tsinghua University, where she uses her mother’s I.D. to explore the library catalogue, which hosts a rich collection of translated Western classics but has scant publications on her specialty. When she awkwardly initiates conversations about the “Tank Man,” she ends up with a member of the campus police. The officer turns out to be an acquaintance of her mother’s, so he lets her go, but the message is clear: if she isn’t careful, a precious child of the motherland can easily become an enemy of the state.
I found Lulu’s bold expedition in Beijing incredible. What kind of sensible person would do this? Sometimes, the novel’s need to cause tension feels at odds with the nature of government-enforced silence, but a novel can’t represent everything; Jin wants to investigate, to connect. Lulu herself is an amusing, if strange, hybrid of an old Chinese soul and an American millennial. She pledges her commitment to her mother by saying, “If I need to carry you around on my back, I’ll do that.” The same Lulu turns around and adoringly calls her close friend a slut. When she figures out that she was conceived in the immediate aftermath of the bloody crackdown, she exclaims, “I am a fucking Tiananmen baby!”
In a way, all the Chinese students who have roamed U.S. campuses in the past two decades are children of Tiananmen. They saw China’s rise as a modern superpower, but they also grew up in the shadow of 1989’s unspeakable fear and internalized guilt. When I visit Beijing from time to time, I occasionally pass by Chang’an Avenue, which runs between the stately Tiananmen gate and the square that bears its name. The street is lined by tall, graceful lamps comically laden with surveillance cameras. I’m always swept away by the site’s crosscurrents of meaning: there’s the sheer and grandiose beauty of the architecture, which has witnessed the fall of dynasties and the attempt, by the People’s Republic, to build an egalitarian country, and there’s the inescapable fact that this place is a symbol of authoritarian control.
To embrace the former makes one a righteous heir; to recognize the latter risks one being disowned. Lulu chooses to hold both possibilities close: she doesn’t accept looking away from atrocities, but she doesn’t throw her life away, either. Her own idea of pragmatism is to live an “independent and fulfilled life.” It would be wrong to forget such history, but it would be wrong, too, to imagine that it could be contained in a thesis, or even in one’s memory. After all, in cautiously phrased news stories, in disappeared citizens, in halting phrases and unfinished conversations, the spectre of Tiananmen lives on. ♦",https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/a-student-chases-the-shadows-of-tiananmen,

Lululemon is entering a major transition as CEO Calvin McDonald prepares to step down on Jan. 31 after a tough year of slowing sales and increasing competition in the athleisure market.
The company announced the leadership change Thursday, along with its latest quarterly results, which showed continued weakness in its largest market, the Americas.
According to AP News, McDonald, who has led the company since 2018, will stay on as a senior advisor through March 2026 while the board searches for a new chief executive.
Lululemon said it is working with a top executive search firm to find someone who can guide the brand through this challenging period.
Board chair Marti Morfitt will immediately take on an expanded role as executive chair to help keep the company's long-term strategy on track.
At the same time, CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will step in as interim co-CEOs once McDonald officially leaves.
Morfitt said Lululemon needs a leader ""with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation"" to help shape the company's next chapter.
Lululemon Battles Falling US Sales
The leadership announcement comes as Lululemon continues to struggle with falling US sales and growing pressure from rivals like Alo Yoga and Vuori.
The company has also faced rising costs tied to tariffs and ongoing criticism from its founder, Chip Wilson, who has publicly argued that the brand is ""in a nosedive.""
Analysts say the intense competition and shifts in fashion — including a return to denim over yoga pants — have created a tougher landscape for Lululemon.
In its latest quarter, the company reported that revenue in the Americas fell 2%, while international sales grew 33%, CNBC reported.
Overall profit dropped 13%, reflecting the uneven demand the company has been facing.
Despite lower earnings, shares rose more than 10% in after-hours trading after the company announced the leadership shake-up and posted results that were better than some analysts expected.
Industry expert Neil Saunders said Lululemon has lost some of the strong positioning it once had.
""The perfect pose that the brand used to execute with ease has given way to a much scrappier posture,"" he wrote, noting that competition is tougher and customers have more choices.

Does It Deserve to Stay in Your Portfolio Too?,0,,,"There are a myriad of upside catalysts investors look to as reasons to buy stocks. Whether it's an earnings beat, or a big announcement, or something like a stock split or index inclusion, there are plenty of reasons why a given stock may be viewed as a buy.
The inverse is also true, and index exclusions (or being taken out of a key index) can be viewed as the kiss of death for companies that many view as blue-chip or ironclad. One such company that's risen to prominence in impressive fashion in recent years is Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy. However, concerns around the company being delisted from the Nasdaq have been alleviated, following the key index's announcement of its annual reconstitution of the Nasdaq-100 Index.
According to this reconstitution, other major names, including Lululemon (LULU) and Biogen (BIIB), will be removed, but Strategy survived.
So, Strategy has avoided the proverbial “kiss of death,” whether perceived or real, but investors still have some concerns to pay attention to.
Let's dive into what's driving investor concern in Strategy and whether the company narrowly escaped a delisting or not.
What's the Deal Behind This Delisting Talk?
Strategy's share price has plunged over the course of the past five months, going from a high of around $450 per share to around $165 per share at the time of writing. That's good for a decline of around 63% in the span of just a few months, good enough to knock many companies out of an index. Indeed, seeing a market capitalization decline from around $127 billion to around $46.5 billion today is significant. And considering that Biogen and Lululemon both have market capitalizations around $25 billion still suggests MSTR stock would need to drop around 40% from here to be delisted, if that's the low water mark to be included in this index.
Strategy's underlying fundamentals rely a great deal on the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which has been plunging of late. And while the company's premium to its mNAV (fair market value of its Bitcoin holdings) has declined substantially over the course of this decline, it's also true that the numbers above aren't encouraging.
A profit margin of -250%, driven by continued debt and equity issuances to buy more Bitcoin, has driven concern among some investors that these high debt loads could drive further market capitalization declines. And given the fact that Strategy's return on assets and return on equity numbers have been driven almost entirely by a (previously) surging Bitcoin price, a reversion in this digital asset's upside trend is one that has some investors spooked.
Perhaps the spookiest metric to me, however, is Strategy's price-sales ratio, which remains around 110 times even after a massive drop. This is a valuation that few investors will consider worth investing in, at least those with a penchant for capital preservation and any sort of conservative view around how companies should be valued.
What Do Analysts Think of Strategy's Future?
I'll have to admit, I didn't expect to see so many Wall Street analysts hold true to their relatively high targets, many of which were set during the recent run-up in this company's shares. But we only have the data that are available to review, so let's do that.
Currently, MSTR stock is still rated as a strong buy, according to the 13 analysts who currently cover this stock. Even more impressively, the consensus price target for MSTR stock remains over $500 per share. At that price level, this stock has implied upside of around 200% from here.
I'm not so sure whether that will be the case, especially considering if Bitcoin continues on the trend it is on right now. We'll see; that's what makes markets. But in terms of companies at risk right now, I'd say MSTR stock has to be high on most investors' lists.

US sales continue to struggle amid product execution challenges
Lululemon Athletica (Nasdaq: LULU), renowned for its premium leggings and athleisure, reported late Thursday a 7% increase in revenue for fiscal Q3 to $2.6 billion (£1.9 billion). However, diluted earnings per share declined to $2.59 (£1.94) from $2.87 (£2.14) a year earlier.
CFO Meghan Frank attributed the better-than-expected revenue and EPS to the company's disciplined execution and its strength across global markets. The stock responded positively, surging 10% during after-hours trading, but the reasons for this move extend beyond the Q3 earnings beat.
The board announced a significant boost to its share repurchase programme, authorising an additional $1 billion (£747.2 million). Additionally, CEO Calvin McDonald will step down, effective 31st January 2026.
McDonald's departure follows mounting pressure from billionaire founder Chip Wilson, who has been urging for changes in the company's senior management. Wilson has expressed concerns as Lululemon focuses on recovery and growth amidst intense competition. Despite strong demand during the Thanksgiving period, McDonald noted that holiday shopping has slowed, and US sales have struggled, declining by 5% in the latest quarter. Meanwhile, international sales grew 33% year-over-year, providing a bright spot for the company's overall revenue.
Product Execution and Marketing Challenges
Analysts have observed that Lululemon has lost ground to rivals such as Alo Yoga and has faced difficulties with its core women's pants segment. Company executives have also acknowledged ongoing product execution challenges.
Operational income dropped 11% in Q3, with operating margins shrinking 350 basis points to 17%. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Wilson was frustrated with the company's marketing strategies and had even considered a proxy fight. Over the past two years, Lululemon's stock has declined by more than 60%. Morningstar analyst David Swartz suggested that investors are likely reassured by the board's decisive action regarding management changes.
Neil Saunders of GlobalData commented, 'Lululemon is now a brand without a captain at the very time when it needs a strong sense of direction. While the market and investors may welcome a change, this shift seems very sudden and hasty. It will be critical for Lululemon to quickly put in place a new CEO or have a very clear interim strategy for getting back on track.'
New Store Openings and Leadership Transition
During the third quarter, the company opened 12 net new stores, bringing its total to 796 operational stores. Meanwhile, McDonald will continue to serve as a senior advisor until 31st March 2026.
Board chair Marti Morfitt will take on an expanded role as executive chair, effective immediately. He will focus on executing Lululemon's near- and long-term growth strategies during this leadership transition.
Additionally, CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs following McDonald's departure. Both bring extensive global retail experience and a proven record of driving growth at the company.
Morfitt expressed confidence in the leadership transition, stating that the board is confident in their ability to deliver on their strategy during this period. Currently, they are focused on identifying a CEO with the experience to manage through periods of growth and transformation.
The company remains committed to its growth objectives, with continued store expansion and strategic initiatives in place, despite the recent leadership upheaval. Investors will be watching closely to see how Lululemon navigates this critical period and whether it can regain its momentum in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

COLUMBIA — South Carolina football will open the 2026 schedule with a home game against Kent State, the program announced Dec. 8.
This comes after South Carolina and Miami mutually agreed to cancel the home-and-home series scheduled for the 2026 and 2027 football seasons. The Gamecocks were set to host the Hurricanes on Sept. 5, 2026.
Both the SEC and ACC are moving to a nine-game conference schedule beginning next season, which limits the number of non-conference opponents per season to three. Miami had four scheduled for 2026 and South Carolina had four for 2027 so the cancelation dropped their schedules down to three each for the next two seasons.
Now South Carolina will play Kent State on the same day, also in Williams-Brice Stadium.
The last time these two programs met was 1995 when the Gamecocks won 77-14.
This season coach Shane Beamer went 4-8 overall and 1-7 in the SEC. Kent State went 5-7 and 4-4 in the Mid-American Conference.
South Carolina's SEC schedule will be finalized on Dec. 11, as all dates for the conference games will be announced. Its opponents have previously been announced, in addition to the two other non-conference games next season.
The Gamecocks will host Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi State, Tennessee and Texas A&M and will travel to Alabama, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma.
They play Townson on Sept. 12 at home then the 2026 Palmetto Bowl on Nov. 28 is in Clemson.

- Just days after Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down, Elliott Investment Management has acquired a more than $1 billion stake in the company and is pushing for former Ralph Lauren executive Jane Nielsen to become CEO of the activewear brand, according to a person familiar with the matter.
- Nielsen served as Ralph Lauren’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer for several years, along with a short stint as interim CEO, and also has experience as the chief financial officer of Coach. She is currently a board member at Mondelēz International, according to her LinkedIn.
- Lululemon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CFO Meghan Frank, who will co-lead the retailer in the interim when McDonald exits, said last week the retailer was looking for experience in growth and transformation for its next CEO.
Dive Insight:
Lululemon’s CEO succession plans have caught the interest of multiple observers.
Founder Chip Wilson last week noted there were “several qualified CEO candidates” that he thought could build on the brand’s legacy, though he did not name them. Wilson also urged the retailer to consult with those with deep knowledge of the brand as the CEO search commences.
Now, investment firm Elliott wants a say as well. The firm believes Nielsen’s experience as a strong strategist will help her in revitalizing the Lululemon brand, according to a person familiar, who also noted significant gains in share price, gross margin expansion and earnings-per-share growth at Ralph Lauren under Nielsen.
Analysts tend to agree. Needham analysts led by Tom Nikic said in emailed comments Thursday that Nielsen would be “an extremely strong candidate for the role,” calling her “one of the most well-respected and capable executives in the industry.” The analysts noted her “immense success” in driving turnarounds at both Ralph Lauren and Coach, though they pointed out that Lululemon is facing different problems than either of those brands.
“Coach and RL were both suffering because of aggressive pushes into downstream distribution (outlets, flash sale sites, off-price, etc.), which stifled margins and diluted the brands' images,” Nikic said, adding that Lululemon’s problems stem from product missteps and increased competition. “Her turnaround experience isn't perfectly aligned with LULU's current ills, but on the bright side, we believe that Coach and RL had much deeper-rooted issues than what LULU is currently facing.”
Jefferies analysts on Wednesday responded to Elliott’s efforts, saying a “refreshed board, a thoughtful CEO with real leadership, and a return to LULU’s roots are critical.” The analysts, led by Randal Konik, outlined their keys to a successful turnaround at Lululemon, including reprioritizing the U.S. market, rationalizing the brand’s store footprint, cutting back on noncore categories like outerwear, rebuilding the innovation pipeline and restoring the brand’s yoga-based DNA.
“Reduce the newness for newness’ sake approach,” Jefferies wrote. “Stop flooding stores w/ disjointed colors, patterns, and logo-heavy designs that dilute brand equity.”
The analysts added that any turnaround will be “a multi-year lift (not easy) but we support the founder’s push and activism.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/activist-investor-elliott-acquires-stake-lululemon-ceo-ralph-lauren-jane-nielsen/808265/,

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.
Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.
But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.
Powell said the Fed is ""well positioned to wait and see"" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a ""one-time"" increase.
That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.
Also, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Natural gas deepens price plummet
Natural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.
Futures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days. After reaching $5 at the end of November, a price not seen since December 2022, the energy product is now trading below $4.30.
The primary catalysts for a price drop have been a one-two punch of weather and supply. Forecasts for the winter have consistently become milder, meaning consumers will be turning on their heaters less than expected. At the same time, US dry gas production is averaging 109.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, a record monthly level, and storage levels are about 3% higher than the average for this time of year.
A larger-than-expected draw out of storage — at 177 bcfd for the week ended Dec. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration — likely moderated the drop, but the move was not enough to stave off a steep drop.
Signs of potential positive movement in peace negotiations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have also pushed prices in Europe steeply down, depressing US prices in sympathy.
Elsewhere in the energy market, international crude oil benchmark Brent (BZ=F) is down roughly 2.1%, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) has lost roughly 2.2%.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees S&P 500 reaching 7,700 by the end of 2026
Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bullishness, is out with his 2026 year-end outlook, in which he calls for another year of a bull market.
Lee sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 10% to reach 7,700 by the end of 2026, driven by the Fed and blockchain adoption. He said the bull market is ""still alive,"" after making significant gains over the past three years.
In his view, earnings and GDP growth will be driven higher by AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street's shift to the blockchain, and the onshoring of manufacturing.
Lee believes a new dovish Fed that favors more cuts could be ""positive for stocks"" in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point but signaled a pause in rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
Lee, also known to be bullish on bitcoin, said the ""best years of growth"" for the cryptocurrency are ""still ahead.""
Some drivers of crypto include Wall Street's ""plans to tokenize all financial products onto the blockchain,"" as well as AI and agentic AI ""creating needs for de-centralized trust and security.""
Lee is the latest strategist to release his S&P 500 2026 year-end target.
Wells Fargo posted its outlook earlier this week. It sees the benchmark index reaching 7,400-7,600 in the year ahead, bolstered by a combination of consumer spending, AI investment, and deregulation.
Both of these add to a string of positive outlooks for the S&P 500 heading into 2026, with forecasts ranging from 7,100 to 8,000, according to data from TKer's Sam Ro.

Nvidia stock falls as Oracle earnings reignite AI spending worries
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 3.5% Thursday morning, as weak earnings from Oracle (ORCL) reignited fears that the AI industry is overspending.
The fall continues tough stretch for the AI chip giant, with shares down roughly 8% over the past month. The leading chipmaker has been caught in worries that, like its Big Tech cohort, the company is overspending on AI development.
At the end of November, Nvidia published a memo to analysts rebutting comparisons between itself and Enron, the scandal-ridden giant whose collapse was instrumental to the stock market crash at the turn of the century.
Additionally, Nvidia faced mixed market reaction to news that the Trump administration has approved export of the company's H200 chips to Chinese buyers. The chipmaker has also faced reports that its signature high-performance Blackwell chips — which are not approved for sale in China — are being used by the Chinese AI developer Deepseek.

US trade deficit narrows in September to hit smallest margin in more than 5 years
The US trade deficit narrowed in September to its smallest margin in more than five years, as exports increased healthily and imports grew slightly.
The deficit shrank by 10.9% to $52.8 billion, according to data released by the Department of Commerce on Thursday, marking the lowest level seen for the measure since June 2020.
Exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion in the month, while imports rose by a much softer 0.6% to $342.1 billion. The month saw noted strength in consumer goods exports, which reached a record high in September, while on the other side, imports of automotive vehicles, engines, and other parts fell to their lowest level since November 2022.
The real goods deficit narrowed by 5.6% on the month, equal to $4.7 billion. Making up that figure, real exports of goods gained 4.2% against a gain in nominal goods exports of 4.9%, while real imports of goods gained 0.7% equal to a gain of 0.7% in nominal goods imports.
Notably, the US' trade deficit with China — a longtime preoccupation of the Trump administration and President Trump personally — shrank to $11.4 billion from a previous $15.4 billion, a change of roughly 25%.

Oil prices extend losses as Maduro responds to tanker seizure, OPEC maintains prediction of balanced 2026 market
Oil prices extended losses by roughly another 1% Thursday morning as the Venezuelan government responded to the seizure of a crude tanker on Wednesday by the US Coast Guard and the OPEC+ cartel disregarded widespread sentiment to predict a balanced oil market in 2026.
Brent crude (BZ=F), the international oil pricing benchmark, traded down by roughly 1.1% to fall below $62, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL=F) lost around 1.2% to trade below $58.
In Caracas, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's government condemned the seizure as an act of ""international piracy."" The vessel, a crude tanker called the Skipper and previously known as the M/T Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for supplying oil to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, according to NPR.
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after news of the seizure broke, marking a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Caracas.
Elsewhere in the oil market, the OPEC+ cartel has maintained its prediction of a balanced oil market in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In a memo seen by Bloomberg, the OPEC+ nations said they will need to produce an average of 43 million barrels per day — roughly the amount of crude they produced last month — to maintain balanced supply and demand.
The posture runs counter to widespread market sentiment that oil is quickly headed for a steep oversupply glut of several million barrels per day, with prices expected to drop heavily in 2026. Analysts at Macquarie have predicted ""punishing oversupply"" coming for the oil market, and JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note that if OPEC does not curb its production, prices on Brent crude could fall as low as the $30s per barrel.

Stocks open mixed as Oracle earnings, jobless claims weigh on market
US stocks diverged at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors weighed fresh insight into the economy alongside signals from Oracle (ORCL) earnings.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and generalist S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, in the first minutes of trading.
The gauges were shaking off deeper premarket drops fueled by Oracle's after-hours earnings on Wednesday. The software maker missed on cloud sales and raised its data center spending by $15 billion, re-stoking fears that tech spending on the AI sector would fail to deliver a payoff.
The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which include fewer tech names, ran in the other direction to gain 0.5%.
After the Fed moved to cut rates for the third time this year, the market's attention turned to a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, reading much higher than expected at 236,000 after falling to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week.
Meanwhile, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Initial jobless claims rise to 236,000, biggest jump since 2020
Data from the Department of Labor published Thursday showed workers filed 236,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 6, the biggest jump since 2020 and an increase of 44,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000 claims. The four-week moving average for initial claims was 216,750.
Ongoing unemployment claims, however, decreased 99,000 to 1.83 million for the week ending Nov. 29.
The data follows a three-year low for initial jobless claims. However, seasonal adjustments and holidays can create volatility around the data. The government shutdown, which disrupted economic data in October and November, has compounded that volatility for major labor market reports.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that ""conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling"" after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

What Is the Bull Case for FNMA Stock Here?,0,,,"Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is once again making waves on Wall Street. And this time, he’s not sounding the alarm on a looming crisis or betting against overvalued stocks. Instead, he’s placing a bullish, long-term wager on one of the most controversial and misunderstood stocks in America: Fannie Mae (FNMA).
In a recent post on his new Substack, Burry revealed that he likes FNMA and views it as a stock worth holding for at least three to five years, signaling unusually high conviction from an investor known for his contrarian instincts. His disclosure comes at a time when Fannie Mae and its sibling Freddie Mac (FMCC) have been thrust back into the spotlight amid growing speculation that President Donald Trump’s administration may move forward with a stake sale, a step that could mark the beginning of the end of more than 17 years of federal conservatorship. That has already sent FNMA shares soaring this year.
So, let’s take a closer look at the bull case for FNMA stock here.
About Fannie Mae Stock
The Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as Fannie Mae, is a government-sponsored enterprise created in 1938 to provide liquidity and stability in the U.S. housing market. Together with Freddie Mac, the company plays a vital role in the U.S. mortgage industry by purchasing mortgages from lenders and bundling them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee the MBS, giving investors confidence that they will be paid even if homeowners default on their mortgages. FNMA’s market cap currently stands at $12.4 billion.
Fannie Mae has been under federal conservatorship since 2008. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed a government bailout in 2008 after the housing bubble burst, as they were exposed to risky loans and securities that included subprime mortgages. The companies suffered billions in losses before Congress created the Federal Housing Finance Agency and placed them into conservatorship. Notably, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have paid billions in dividends to the U.S. government under conservatorship, exceeding the amounts they received in the bailout, and are now profitable.
Shares of the secondary mortgage market giant have more than tripled this year, driven by speculation that the Trump administration will privatize Fannie Mae and its sibling Freddie Mac, bringing an end to federal conservatorship.
Fannie Mae Emerges as One of Michael Burry’s Top Picks
Michael Burry, known for his early bet against the U.S. housing market and for being portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short,” recently revealed his four stock picks. To add some context, Burry shut his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, to outside investors last month, saying he felt “muzzled” by SEC rules, and now shares his views through his new Substack, called “Cassandra Unchained.” And one stock Burry recently revealed he’s betting big on is Fannie Mae.
“You know I own and like LULU, MOH, FOUR,” Burry wrote in a post last Wednesday. “Also FNMA, but as a pink sheet stock, it was never disclosed. These are all 3-5 year holds minimum. I will write each of these up as well as others in future posts. The 2-12B market cap range is the most fertile area as I see it today.”
The four tickers Burry posted correspond to Lululemon Athletica (LULU), Molina Healthcare (MOH), Shift4 Payments (FOUR), and Fannie Mae. The first three have appeared in Scion Asset Management’s portfolio updates over the past year or so, while Fannie Mae trades over the counter, meaning the Big Short investor’s hedge fund wasn’t required to disclose it in its 13F filings. With that, Burry’s holding in FNMA was disclosed for the first time.
Interestingly, Fannie Mae is the only one of Burry’s four recommended stocks that is up this year. FNMA shares have spiked 251.97% year-to-date. Still, Burry recommended it as a “low-priced buy” stock, as it has retreated 38.3% from its recent peak of $15.99.
While Burry said he plans to write about each of his stock picks in future posts, the bull case for Fannie Mae seems obvious, so let’s dive in.
The Bull Case for FNMA Stock
The bullish catalyst for Fannie Mae centers on its potential release from government control. The current market value of FNMA stock is depressed due to its conservatorship status. Any indications that the conservatorship situation could change have prompted traders to flock into Fannie and Freddie shares, betting the stocks could spike if the companies — and their profits — are freed from government control. Billionaire Bill Ackman has supported that thesis, arguing the stocks will soar once the U.S. government unwinds its sizable stakes.
Notably, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), established in 2008 to oversee the struggling mortgage firms, coordinated the largest bailout in U.S. history, totaling $191 billion in taxpayer funding. In exchange, the government assumed effective ownership of Fannie and Freddie, taking control of 80% (technically 79.9%) of their shares.
The Trump administration has been considering a public offering of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Trump is reportedly considering launching the offering as early as year-end or in early 2026. The plan could value the mortgage giants at over $500 billion and involve selling 5% to 15% of their shares, with the offering expected to raise around $30 billion.
Meanwhile, the government will still be the largest shareholder of the mortgage giants even after the offering. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a CNBC interview in September that the government does not want to “sell a lot” of its stake in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA Director Bill Pulte said in September that the Trump administration is considering offering about 5% of each entity. Pulte reiterated that last month, adding that he expects “the president will make a decision either this quarter or early next year as it relates to the IPO.”
With that, market participants are awaiting the outcome. Still, Ackman recently said it “will take significant time” for the government to “deliberately execute” the IPO. But that isn’t a problem for Burry, as he’s already said the stock is a minimum 3-5 year hold.
What Do Analysts Expect for FNMA Stock?
Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts remain cautious on Fannie Mae stock after its strong rally this year. Among the five analysts covering the stock, two rate it a “Strong Buy,” one recommends holding, one gives it a “Moderate Sell” rating, and the remaining one assigns a “Strong Sell” rating. This translates to a consensus rating of “Hold.” The average price target for FNMA stock is $12.88, representing 11.4% upside potential from current levels.
Last week, Wedbush Securities double-upgraded Fannie Mae to “Outperform” from “Underperform” and raised its price target on the stock to $11.50 from $1.00. “Our rating, price target, and investment outlook are based on our analysis of the implications of a range of steps that the Trump Administration might take to recapitalize FNMA, put it on the path to leaving conservatorship, and monetize Treasury’s investments in the company,” said analyst Henry Coffey.

- South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley is uncertain if Madina Okot and Agot Makeer will return for the team's upcoming road trip.
- The Gamecocks defeated Penn State 95-55 with only eight available players.
- Okot, the team's starting center, is dealing with an unspecified illness, while Makeer has been in concussion protocol.
- Despite their absence, both players participated in pre-game warmups before being ruled out.
(This article was updated to add new information)
COLUMBIA — South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley had just eight players in the 95-55 win over Penn State on Dec. 14 and is unsure if she will get Madina Okot and Agot Makeer for the upcoming two-game road trip.
The No. 3 Gamecocks (10-1) did not struggle without Okot in the 40-point win except for losing the rebounding battle 51-43.
But South Carolina could still be without the 6-foot-6 starting center and reserve guard at South Florida (Dec. 18, 7 p.m., ESPN2) and at Florida Gulf Coast (Dec. 20, 2 p.m., ESPN+).
""It's day to day, we're not going to force them to make things worse,"" Staley said after the win.
Staley did not specify what Okot was dealing with. When Okot missed the second half of the previous game vs North Carolina Central on Dec. 7, Staley said it was because she felt ""a little sick.""
Makeer was in concussion protocol as of Dec. 3 and missed the last three games. But along with Okot, she warmed up with the team. The program announced via X they were both ruled out.
""I think we're super conservative, I don't have a say in it, I get a report every day and the report is, we're going to continue but they're not there yet,"" Staley said. ""We'll just adhere to what they're telling us and if we get them back, it's going to help us. If we don't we just have to keep moving forward.""
Not having either player wasn't a total surprise as Staley wasn't confident she'd have everyone available to check in as of Dec. 12 when she spoke to media after practice. With Makeer specifically, Staley said being careful was huge to prevent another concussion.
Neither looked limited during warmups, with no noticeable medical tape or gear on Okot. They went through stretching routines with the other players and were on the bench the entire game.
Okot has seven double-doubles on the season and was just named SEC Player of the Week. She's averaging 14.8 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.
Adhel Tac started in place of Okot but finished with two points. Maryam Dauda, the other reserve forward/post, had three.

COLUMBIA — Landon Duckworth, a four-star South Carolina football commit signed with the Gamecocks despite reports he might flip to LSU and new coach Lane Kiffin.
Duckworth signed on Dec. 4, the second of a three-day early signing period. He is the 13th recruit to sign of 14 commits, with Triston Lewis still unsigned. Lewis is signing at 5:30 p.m. ET on Dec. 4. South Carolina flipped four-star edge rusher Julian Walker from Michigan hours before Duckworth signed.
Duckworth is from Jackson, Alabama, and is the No. 6 player from the state and No. 10 quarterback in his class according to the 247Sports Composite.
The quarterback had been committed to coach Shane Beamer's program since July 18 but went on a visit to LSU in September, before Brian Kelly was fired.
Beamer doesn't know if he will have starting quarterback LaNorris Sellers back next year. Duckworth is the only quarterback in the Class of 2026 for the Gamecocks. He was recruited by former position coach and offensive coordinator Mike Shula, who was fired on Nov. 2.
Landon Duckworth signs with South Carolina
Duckworth had interest from South Carolina, LSU, Auburn, Appalachian State and Alabama State. He took his official visit to Columbia on June 6 and announced his commitment not long after.
Beamer is set to have transfer Air Noland and Cutter Woods, a true freshman, in his quarterback room with Duckworth.

COLUMBIA — South Carolina football is finalizing a deal to hire TCU's Kendal Briles as coach Shane Beamer's offensive coordinator, according to ESPN's Pete Thamel, and one player is already celebrating the news.
A little less than 24 hours after Thamel's report, 2026 signee Landon Duckworth posted two photos on social media, both with Briles, one from his time at Arkansas and the other from TCU. The caption endorsed the hire if finalized, as Duckworth wrote ""Coach @kendalbriles was the first coach to offer me! Let’s work @GamecockFB.""
South Carolina hasn't made any announcement about Briles
Duckworth is a four-star quarterback from Alabama, who had interest from Arkansas, where Briles was the coordinator from 2020-22.
Beamer is making his fourth hire at the position in his five seasons with the Gamecocks. They went 4-8 this season, the worst record under his leadership.
Mike Shula was fired on Nov. 2 after less than one full year and wide receiver coach Mike Furrey called plays for the last three games of the season. Beamer promoted Shula from offensive analyst to coordinator last December when former Dowell Loggains was hired to coach Appalachian State.
Briles joined the TCU staff in January 2023 as associate head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. This will mark Briles' seventh college offensive coordinator job. Before Arkansas, he worked at Baylor, Houston, FAU and Florida State.
Whether Briles will have quarterback LaNorris Sellers or not remains unclear, as Sellers hasn't announced if he's staying or declaring for the NFL draft.

- South Carolina's board of trustees approved the hiring of Stan Drayton as the new running backs coach.
- Drayton's three-year contract is worth $775,000 annually, replacing the recently fired Marquel Blackwell.
COLUMBIA — South Carolina's board of trustees approved the hiring of Stan Drayton as running backs coach for Shane Beamer on Dec. 11.
Drayton's new contract is for three-years, worth $775,000 per year. This move comes a week after Beamer fired Marquel Blackwell after two seasons at the position.
The board also approved the hiring of Kendal Briles as the new offensive coordinator and Randy Clements as offensive line coach, filling all three open positions for Beamer.
Shane Beamer hires Stan Drayton as new RB coach at South Carolina
Drayton was with Penn State for one season after three years at Temple.
Since 1993, he's worked at different schools as either the running back or wide receiver coach. He spent one season in the NFL from 2015-16 with the Chicago Bears before coming back to college to work at Texas in 2017.
The Nittany Lions fired coach James Franklin midway through the season and are 6-6. They'll face Clemson in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium on Dec. 27.
Drayton's group rushed for 2,130 yards, led by Kaytron Allen who had 1,303 yards on the ground and 15 touchdowns. Penn State's Nicholas Singleton added 13 TDs as the Nittany Lions averaged 177.5 rushing yards per game, fourth in the Big Ten.
To compare, Blackwell's group at South Carolina finished last in the SEC with 111.1 rushing yards per game and had a total of 1,333 rushing yards.
Drayton has an impressive resume as a running backs coach, having guided star running backs like Bijan Robinson (Penn State) and Ezekiel Elliott (Ohio State).

South Carolina football coach Shane Beamer capped off a week filled with three new coaching hires with a father-son trip.
Beamer took his son Hunter, 12, to the Army vs. Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, on Dec. 13. Beamer and his son went to the Philadelphia Eagles vs Las Vegas Raiders game on Dec. 14 in Philadelphia.
The Eagles are the hometown team of women's basketball coach Dawn Staley, who Beamer gave a shout-out to when posting a picture from the game. Staley's Gamecocks play Penn State at 3:30 ET (ESPN).
""Not back yet….Day 2 of Father-Son weekend today. Fired up to be in Philly for Eagles-Raiders. I’m trying to do my part for your team @dawnstaley,"" he wrote on X.
This is the second time in five seasons at South Carolina that Beamer isn't preparing for a bowl game. The Gamecocks went 4-8, the worst record in his tenure.
He revealed that this year marked his first Army vs. Navy game, but it's not uncommon for Beamer to attend various college games when he's off.
In 2024, in between the win over Clemson to close the regular season and the Dec. 31 Citrus Bowl, Beamer went to the SEC Championship game in Atlanta.
Why is Shane Beamer at the Eagles vs Raiders game?
Beamer used to coach Jalen Hurts, the Eagles star quarterback, when he was in college at Oklahoma. Beamer was on staff in Norman before he was hired at South Carolina in December 2020.
The Eagles are facing the Las Vegas Raiders, where Tonka Hemingway plays. Hemingway was drafted in the 2025 NFL Draft and played five seasons at defensive tackle for the Gamecocks, four of them under Beamer.

Clemson football brought a piece of home to the Bronx and took advantage of the very wintry conditions.
The Tigers (7-5) are playing Penn State (6-6) in the Pinstripe Bowl on Dec. 27 at Yankee Stadium, hours after just under five inches of snow draped New York City overnight.
Before each home game, Clemson players touch Howard’s Rock, which sits at the top of the hill in Memorial Stadium, before running down the hill onto the field.
The program posted a photo online before kickoff of the bowl game version, which appeared to be a chunk of snow formed together with a rock, dyed orange with a hand-written sign in front. It's located right where Clemson came out on the field.
The caption read ""ready to give 110%"" which is a nod to what the rock and pre-game tradition represents. ABC's broadcast said the last snow game Clemson played in was 2001 and there was a makeshift Howard's Rock then too.
What is Clemson football's Howard's Rock?
Former football coach Frank Howard was given the rock by a friend who found it in Death Valley, California, according to Clemson. The rock was placed at the top of the hill before a game on Sept. 24, 1966, and has been there ever since.
The players began rubbing the rock before each game during the 1967 season. Clemson's home stadium has been referred to as Death Valley since roughly 1945.

US stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points in its final policy decision of the year, while Chair Jerome Powell expressed confidence about the trajectory of inflation and of growth in the US economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 1%, or around 500 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.7%, finishing just below a record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained nearly 0.3%.
The small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) also notched a fresh all-time high.
The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday for the third time this year. But the central bank signaled a slower pace of easing ahead, projecting one more cut for 2026. The decision means the central bank's benchmark interest rate now sits in a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.
The decision drew dissents on both sides. Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid and Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee disagreed with the decision, preferring to hold rates steady. On the other side, Fed governor Stephen Miran pushed to cut rates by a half a percentage point.
In his press conference following the decision, Powell acknowledged the ""tension"" in the central bank's dual mandate. But he suggested that President Trump's tariffs — which he pointed to as the reason for an ""overshoot"" of the Fed's inflation target — were still likely to represent a ""one-time"" price increase. And he touted the US economy's strength, including in AI-related growth.
JPMorgan strategist Stephanie Aliaga told Yahoo Finance there were no ""surprises"" from Powell's press conference.
Meanwhile, tech trade will get a key test Wednesday with an earnings report from Oracle (ORCL), as Wall Street increasingly looks to the cloud firm as one of the proxies for the AI trade. Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) are set for earnings reports on Thursday. Finally, US manufacturer GE Vernova (GEV) shares soared over 15% after doubling its dividend.
