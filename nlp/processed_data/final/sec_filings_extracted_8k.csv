April 3, 2013, we provided an update on our black luon production issues. After an evaluation of our previously disclosed black luon production issues, we concluded that the current specification and testing protocols for our signature fabric
luon that were developed in 2006 have not materially changed. However, production of luon is a complex process with a number of different inputs, and fabric is the key factor. While the fabric involved may have met testing standards, it was on the
low end of our tolerance scale and we have found that our testing protocols were incomplete for some of the variables in fabric characteristics. When combined with subtle style changes in pattern, the resulting end product had an unacceptable level
of sheerness. We intend to take appropriate measures to address what we believe are the contributing causes of the black luon production issues.",nlp\raw_data\sec_filings_8k\lulu\8-K\0001193125-13-140668.txt
