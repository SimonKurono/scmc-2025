(""Aritzia"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: ATZ) today announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") has accepted its notice of intention to proceed with a normal course issuer bid (""NCIB""). Pursuant to the NCIB, Aritzia may purchase up to 4,226,994 of its subordinate voting shares (""Shares""), representing approximately 5% of the public float of 84,539,881 Shares as at April 30, 2025, during the twelve-month period commencing May 7, 2025 and ending May 6, 2026. As at April 30, 2025, there were 94,751,567 Shares issued and outstanding. Under the NCIB, other than purchases made under block purchase exemptions, Aritzia may purchase up to 153,356 Shares on the TSX during any trading day, which represents approximately 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX for the most recently completed six calendar months (being 613,425 Shares) prior to the TSX's acceptance of the notice of the NCIB. Any Shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled. Aritzia's Board of Directors believes that an NCIB represents an appropriate and desirable use of its available cash, after prioritizing investments in boutiques and strategic infrastructure, to increase shareholder value and is in the best interest of Aritzia and its shareholders. As at March 2, 2025, the Company had approximately $286 million of cash and cash equivalents.",nlp\raw_data\sec_can\news_releases\Aritzia_-_NCIB_2025_-_Announcement_Press_Release.pdf

Any purchases made under the NCIB will be made by Aritzia subject to favourable market conditions at the prevailing market price at the time of acquisition through the facilities of the TSX and/or alternative Canadian trading systems.

Any purchases made under NCIB will be made by Aritzia at the prevailing market price at the time of acquisition and through the facilities of the TSX or alternative Canadian trading systems, as applicable. The Company may rely on an automatic share purchase plan during the NCIB. The automatic share purchase plan would allow for purchases by the Company of Shares during certain pre-determined blackout periods, subject to certain parameters and approval of the TSX. Pursuant to the Company's prior normal course issuer bid, the Company sought and received approval from the TSX to purchase up to 3,515,740 of its Shares for the period from January 22, 2024 to January 21, 2025.

This includes the contribution from retail expansion with a minimum of 12 new boutiques and five boutique repositions, including four new boutiques and one reposition in the first half of the fiscal year. Ten new boutiques and two repositions are expected to be in the United States with the remainder in Canada. – Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue to be approximately 14% to 15% compared to 14.8% in Fiscal 2025, driven by IMU improvements, freight tailwinds, savings from the Company's smart spending initiative and expense leverage, offset by the higher US tariffs. – Capital cash expenditures (net of proceeds from lease incentives)2 of approximately $180 million.
