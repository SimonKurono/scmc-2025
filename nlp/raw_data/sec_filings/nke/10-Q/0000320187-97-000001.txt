NOTE 4 - Commitments and contingencies: 
         _____________________________ 
 
     There have been no other significant subsequent developments

NOTE 5 - Change in year-end of certain subsidiaries: 
         __________________________________________ 
 
     Prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of the Company's international 
operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag 
which allowed more time to compile results.  The Company has taken steps 
to improve its internal reporting procedures that has allowed for 
more timely reporting of these operations.  Beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.  As a 
result, the May 1996 loss from operations for these entities of 
$4.1 million was recorded directly to retained earnings in the first 
quarter of the current year.  The change affected the previously reported 
quarterly periods for these operations and thus, the income satement and 
cash flow statement have been presented to show comparable results for the 
quarter and year as if the change had occurred in the prior year.  The effect 
of the change is not material to the consolidated balance sheet and as a 
result the balance sheet as of May 31, 1996 has not been adjusted. 
 
NOTE 6 - Subsequent Event: 
         ______________ 
 
     In December of 1996, the Company issued $200 million seven-year notes 
maturing December 1, 2003, with a stated rate of 6.375%.
 
Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
     Net income increased 81% over the prior year's second quarter, 
rising to $176.9 million, or $0.60 per share, from $97.8 million, or 
$0.34 per share last year.  Year-to-date net income increased 44% to 
$402.9 million, $3 million more than the Company's net income for the 
entire 1995 fiscal year.  Revenues were $2.1 billion, up 55% for the 
quarter and 44% year-to-date.  This quarter is the ninth straight 
quarter of double digit increases in total revenues.  Gross margin 
percentage increased slightly for both the quarter and year-to- 
date, while selling and administrative expenses decreased as a 
percentage of revenues for the quarter, but increased as a percentage 
of revenues on a year-to-date basis. 
 
     Revenues for the quarter increased $750.3 million over 
the $1.4 billion reported in the same period of the prior year.  
U.S. revenues increased $459.9 million, or 63%, for the second quarter, 
and $840.3 million, or 49%, on a year-to-date basis.  U.S. apparel 
increased 93% over last year's second quarter and has increased more 
than 85% in each of the last six quarters.  U.S. footwear increased 
$277.8 million, or 52%, over last year's second quarter due to a 48% 
increase in pairs sold and a 4% increase in average selling price.  
Increases can be seen in almost all categories, the most significant 
being men's basketball up 38%, men's running up 90%, men's cross- 
training up 57%, and women's fitness up 79%.  For the quarter 
international revenues increased $292.2 million, or 60%, with strong 
growth in both footwear and apparel.  Year-to-date, international 
revenues increased $495.0 million, or 46%.  All regions showed double 
digit increases for the quarter with Europe up 42%, comprised of a 37% 
increase in footwear and a 53% increase in apparel; Asia Pacific was up 
96%, with a 111% growth rate in footwear and a 73% increase in apparel; 
and the Americas region was up 45%, increasing 25% in footwear and 135% 
in apparel.  Japan, now the largest country outside the U.S. in 
revenues, increased 171% in the quarter and 111% for the year.  The 
impact of exchange rates on the quarter's revenue was a decrease of $38 
million, or 8%.  For the year, rates have decreased revenues by $93 
million, or 9%.  Other brands, which includes Cole Haan (R), Tetra 
Plastics, Sports Specialties and Bauer Inc., decreased slightly, $1.8 
million, (1%), for the quarter and $3.1 million, (1%), year-to-date.  
The breakdown of revenues follows:

</TABLE> 
 
(1) For comparable purposes with 1996, results for the three and six months 
ended November 30, 1995 have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of 
the one month lag in reporting by certain of the Company's international 
operations.  See further discussion under Note 5. 
 
     Consolidated gross margin percentage was 39.4% for the quarter 
compared to 39.0% for last year's second quarter.  Year-to-date margins 
are at 39.9% compared to 39.8% for last year.  The increase in gross 
margin percentage is primarily attributed to footwear price increases 
taking effect in this quarter as well as changes to product and customer 
mix during the period.  The Company continues to place strong emphasis 
on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange risk and production 
sourcing in order to maximize gross profit.  Gross profit percentages 
for the remainder of fiscal year 1997 are expected to be affected by 
both strong demand for NIKE products and increased pricing levels, 
offset by increased levels of air freight to meet the delivery dates or 
increasing customer orders.  At this time, Management expects the 
percentage for the full year to be up only slightly from last fiscal 
year's percentage.* 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $177 million over the 
previous year's second quarter and $337 million year-to-date.  As a 
percentage of revenues, expenses have decreased to 25.2% for the 
quarter, down from 26.1% for the same period last year.  On a 
year-to-date basis, expenses have increased to 24.2%, up from 23.6%. 
For the quarter, the revenue growth outstripped the expenses, 
resulting in a lower percentage, however, increased spending on 
advertising and marketing, as well as increased infrastructure costs, 
make up the majority of both the dollar and percentage increases.  At 
this time, Management expects selling and administrative expenses as a 
percentage of revenues for the year will approximate the prior year.* 
 
     Interest expense increased for both the quarter and year-to-date 
over the prior year due to increased short-term borrowings for growing 
operations, mostly in Europe and Asia Pacific. Other expense decreased 
$7.5 million for the quarter and $9.1 million year-to-date primarily due 
to decreased conversion loss on foreign transactions, gains on the 
disposal of fixed assets, and income earned from a promotional event in 
Japan. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 38.75% 
compared to 38.5% in the prior year.  The slight increase is due 
primarily to higher state income taxes on U.S. earnings.  At this time, 
Management anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1997 will remain at 
approximately 38.75%.* 
 
     Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from December 1996 through April 1997 were 
approximately $4.1 billion, 54% higher than such orders booked in the 
comparable period of the prior year.  These orders and the percentage 
growth in these orders are not necessarily indicative of the growth in 
revenues which the Company will experience for the subsequent periods.  
This is because the mix of advance futures and "at once" orders has 
shifted significantly toward futures orders as the NIKE brand becomes 
more established in all areas, specifically in the U.S. apparel business 
and in international regions.  The mix of advance orders to "at once" 
orders will continue to vary as the U.S. apparel business and 
international operations continue to account for a greater percentage of 
total revenues and as each places a greater emphasis on futures 
programs.*   Finally, exchange rates can cause differences in the 
comparisons.*
 
     As further explained in Note 5, prior to fiscal year 1997, certain 
of the Company's international operations reported their results of 
operations on a one month lag in order to allow more time for compiling 
results.  The Company has taken steps to improve its internal reporting 
procedures which have allowed for more timely reporting of these 
operations.  Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one 
month lag was eliminated.  As a result, the May 1996 operational results 
for these entities of a $4.1 million loss was recorded to retained 
earnings in the first quarter of the current year.  The change affected 
the previously reported quarterly periods for these operations, and 
thus, the income statement and cash flow statement have been adjusted in 
order to show comparable results for the previous periods as if the 
change had occurred in the prior year.  Throughout this discussion, 
comparisons to last year are also stated as they would have appeared had 
these entities reported on a same month basis. 
 
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
     The Company's financial position remains strong at November 30, 1996.  
Since May 31, 1996, total assets grew $470 million to approximately $4.4 
billion and shareholder's equity increased $388 million to $2.8 billion.  
Working capital increased $346 million, and the Company's current ratio 
increased to 2.10:1 at November 30, 1996 from 1.86:1 at May 31, 1996.  

     Cash provided by operations included year-to-date net income of $403 
million plus the year-to-date non-cash depreciation charge of $58 million.  
Cash used by changes in other working capital components totaled $354 million 
due, in large part, to increases in accounts receivable and inventory. Since 
May 31, 1996, accounts receivable increased $226 million (17%) due to the high 
level of revenues compared to the same period in the prior year.  Inventory 
levels increased $50 million from May 31, as total international inventory 
increased $52 million in order to support revenue volume.  Inventory turns 
increased to 5.56 at November 30, 1996 from 5.01 at May 31, 1996.
 
     Cash used in investing activities totaled $203 million for the first six 
months of fiscal 1997.  Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled 
$188 million with the most significant components related to the continued 
consolidation of European footwear warehouses, the overall expansion of U.S. 
operations and the continued expansion of NIKE Town retail locations in 
the U.S. 
 
     Cash provided from financing activities included an increase from 
May 31, 1996 of $100 million in long-term debt due, primarily, to the 
Company's Japanese subsidiary borrowing 10.5 billion yen in the first 
quarter.  Cash was used to decrease notes payable by $28 million and to 
pay dividends totaling $43 million. 
 
     During the quarter, the Company announced a 33% increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend to $.10 per share from the previous $.075 per share. 

     The Company's commercial paper program requires the support of committed 
and uncommitted lines of credit.  There was $6 million outstanding under 
this program at November 30, 1996.  The Company has $500 million available in 
committed unused lines of credit and, at November 30, 1996, no amounts were 
outstanding under this credit facility. NIKE's debt-to-equity ratio at 
November 30, 1996 remained constant from May 31 at .6:1. 
 
     In December of 1996, the Company issued $200 million of seven-year notes, 
maturing December 1, 2003 (see Note 6).  The proceeds from the sale of the 
notes, received December 13, 1996, will be used for general corporate purposes 
including, without limitation, refinancing, in part, short-term debt. 
 
     Management believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources and long-term debt arrangements,will 
continue to adequately finance anticipated fiscal 1997 expenditures.*

                         SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE SAVINGS PLAN 
 
                                  1995 RESTATEMENT 
 
                                    June 1, 1995 
 
 
NIKE, Inc. 
an Oregon corporation 
One Bowerman Drive 
Beaverton, OR  97005-6453                                    "Company" 
 
 
The Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Savings Plan effective 
February 1, 1994 to provide an opportunity for executive employees 
to set aside additional amounts for retirement on a tax deferred basis 
and to provide a limited make-up of profit sharing contributions lost 
as a result of the $150,000 limit on compensation counted under the 
Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of NIKE, 
Inc. (the "Profit Sharing Plan").   The make-up contribution is being 
expanded effective June 1, 1995 through adoption of a separate NIKE, 
Inc. Supplemental Executive Profit Sharing Plan.  In order to continue 
the provisions for elective tax deferred savings, the Company adopts 
this 1995 Restatement of the Supplemental Executive Savings Plan (the 
"Plan"). 
 
     1.     Employers; Administration; Plan Year. 
 
     1.1    The Plan shall apply to the Company and to other members of 
the Controlled Group designated by the Company.  The "Controlled Group" 
is the controlled group of corporations, as defined in Internal Revenue 
Code Section 1563(a), of which the Company is a member.  The term 
"Employer" refers to the Company and such a designated member of the 
Controlled Group. 
 
     1.2    The Plan shall be administered by the Retirement Committee 
established under the Profit Sharing Plan (the "Committee").  The 
Committee shall interpret the Plan, determine eligibility and the amount 
of benefits, maintain records, and generally be responsible for seeing 
that the purposes of the Plan are accomplished.  The Committee may 
delegate all or part of its administrative duties to others. 
 
     1.3    "Plan Year" means the 12-month period starting each June 1 
and ending on the following May 31. 
 
     2.     Eligibility; Deferral Election. 
 
     2.1    An executive employee of an Employer shall be eligible to 
defer compensation under the Plan for a Plan Year if the employee's 
annual salary rate from the Employer as of the June 1 at the start of 
such Plan Year equals or exceeds $150,000 or such higher amount as is 
fixed with cost-of-living adjustments under Internal Revenue Code 
Section 401(a)(17).  
 
     2.2    An employee eligible under 2.1 may elect to defer 
compensation for each Plan Year by completing a "Deferral Election" 
in a form prescribed by the Committee, signing it and returning it to 
the Committee.  The Deferral Election shall designate a dollar amount 
or percentage to be deferred out of the employee's annual salary and 
annual Performance Sharing Plan bonus, which dollar amount or percentage 
may be different as between salary and bonus.  A deferral of bonus shall 
be controlled by the Deferral Election for the Plan Year in which the 
bonus is paid.  To be effective for any Plan Year, the Deferral Election 
must be returned before June 1 of the Plan Year, except as provided in 
2.3.  A Deferral Election shall apply to a single Plan Year and shall be 
irrevocable after the start of that Plan Year, except as follows.  A 
Participant may elect at any time to reduce the amount or percentage to 
be deferred from salary earned in the remainder of the Plan 
Year to zero.  Such an election shall be effective for the remainder of 
the Plan Year and shall be irrevocable.  A new Deferral Election must be 
returned to continue deferrals for subsequent Plan Years. 
 
     2.3    An executive employee who comes into a position with an 
annual salary rate at or above the level described in 2.1 during a Plan 
Year, whether by hire from outside the Company or promotion to a higher 
salary level, shall be eligible to defer the Participant's salary for 
the remainder of the Plan Year.  To be effective, a Deferral Election by 
such a Participant must be returned within 30 days of the date the 
Participant becomes eligible.  The provisions of 2.2 on irrevocability 
and reduction to zero shall apply to elections under this 2.3.  This 2.3 
shall be effective January 1, 1997.  The 30-day election period for all 
executive employees who moved into an eligible position since June 1, 
1996 shall expire January 30, 1997. 
 
     2.4    The Employer shall reduce the Participant's salary or bonus 
by the amounts deferred under 2.2 or 2.3 and shall credit such amounts 
to the Participant's Account under 3.1.  Amounts due for FICA taxes on 
the elected amounts shall be withheld from the Participant's remaining 
salary and bonus. 
 
     2.5    "Participant" means an executive employee who is eligible 
for and elects deferral of compensation under 2.2 or 2.3. 
 
     3.     Accounts. 
 
     3.1    Each Participant who defers compensation under 2.2 or 2.3 
shall have an "Account" in this Plan.  All deferred compensation amounts 
elected by a Participant shall be credited to the Participant's Account 
as of the date they would have been paid to the Participant if not 
deferred. 
 
     3.2    Each Account shall be credited with Interest monthly until 
the entire Account has been paid out.  "Interest" means an amount 
calculated at a rate equal to 120 percent of the federal mid-term rate 
in effect on the last business day of the month, as published from time 
to time by the Internal Revenue Service. 
 
     3.3    A Participant's Account shall be fully vested at all times. 
 
     4.     Trust.
 
     The Company shall establish a trust (the "Trust") with a financial 
institution as trustee for payment of benefits under the Plan.  The 
Trust shall be a grantor trust for tax purposes.  The Trust shall 
provide that any assets contributed to the trustee shall be used 
exclusively for payment of benefits under this Plan except in the event 
the Company becomes insolvent, in which case the Trust assets shall be 
held for payment of the Company's obligations to its general creditors. 
 
     5.     Payment of Benefits to the Participant. 
 
     5.1    The "Payment Amount" shall be the vested balance in the 
Participant's Account, including deferred compensation and Interest. 
 
     5.2    The Payment Amount shall be payable to a Participant under 
the Plan upon termination of all employment of the Participant with the 
Controlled Group.  A Participant who is receiving benefits from Employer
 on account of disability shall not be treated as having a termination 
of employment until such benefits cease and the Participant does not 
return to work. 
 
     5.3    A Participant's termination under 5.2 shall constitute a 
retirement for purposes of this Plan if at the time of termination the 
Participant has attained age 55 and has been continuously employed for 
five or more years within the Controlled Group. 
 
     5.4    The form of payment shall be as follows.  If the 
Participant's termination of employment under 5.2 is not a retirement as 
described in 5.3, the Payment Amount shall be based on Interest accrued 
to the end of the month of employment termination and payment shall be 
made in a lump sum as soon as practicable after such month end.  If the 
termination is a retirement, the Payment Amount shall be paid in one of 
the following ways as determined under 5.5: 
 
          (a)     In a lump sum on the January 1 following the date of 
employment termination. 
 
          (b)     In ten substantially equal annual installments 
beginning on the January 1 following the date of employment termination. 
 
     5.5    The Participant shall select the form of payment under 5.4 
on a form provided by the Committee for that purpose.  A Participant's 
selection shall be irrevocable for amounts credited to the Participant's 
Account while the selection is in effect and for any Interest 
attributable to such amounts.  A Participant may change the form of 
payment by written notice to the Committee.  Such a change shall be 
effective on the first day of the Plan Year beginning after the 
Committee receives notice of the change.  A change of payment form shall 
apply only to amounts credited to the Participant's Account after the 
change becomes effective and Interest attributable thereto.  
If the Payment Amount as of the January 1 following the date of 
employment termination is less than $100,000, payment shall be made as 
provided in 5.4(a) regardless of the form selected by the Participant.  
If no form of payment is selected by a Participant, payment shall be 
made in the form described in 5.4(b). 
 
     5.6    If all or a portion of any payment of benefits under this 
Section 5 to a Participant would not be deductible for federal income 
tax purposes by the Company because of a limitation on the total amount 
of the Participant's deductible compensation from the Company, including 
any other such compensation already paid to the Participant earlier in 
the same fiscal year of the Company, the following shall apply: 
 
          (a)     Payment of the nondeductible amount shall be deferred 
until the first day of the following fiscal year of the Company. 
 
          (b)     If the amount deferred under (a) would exceed the 
limitation on the total amount of the Participant's deductible 
compensation from the Company for the following fiscal year, the excess 
shall be deferred to the first day of succeeding fiscal years until all 
of the Payment Amount falls underneath the limitation on total 
deductible compensation, subject to (c).
 
          (c)     In no event shall any payment be deferred under this 
5.6 more than three years from the date scheduled for payment under 5.4. 
 
          (d)     Interest shall continue to be credited under 3.3 
during the period of deferral under this 5.6. 
 
     5.7    The Company may withhold from any payments any deductions 
required by law. 
 
     6.     Death Benefits. 
 
     6.1    A Participant's Payment Amount shall be payable under 6.2 
through 6.4 on the Participant's death regardless of the provisions of 
Section 5. 
 
     6.2    On death, the Payment Amount shall be paid to the 
Participant's Beneficiary as follows: 
 
          (a)     If the Beneficiary is the surviving spouse or 
permanent partner of the Participant, the amount for which the 
Participant had selected installments under 5.4(b) shall be paid to the 
Beneficiary by installments in accordance with the selection, beginning 
within 30 days after the Participant's death. 
 
          (b)     Any amount not described in (a) shall be paid to the 
Beneficiary in a lump sum within 30 days after the Participant's death. 

          (c)     If the Payment Amount as of the date of death is 
less than $100,000, payment shall be made as provided in (b) 
regardless of whether the Beneficiary is the surviving spouse or 
permanent partner. 
 
     6.3    "Beneficiary" means the death beneficiary designated by the 
Participant under the Profit Sharing Plan unless the Participant submits 
to the Committee a different designation for this Plan on a form 
provided for the purpose, which shall then control.  If the Participant 
has no surviving Beneficiary designated under either plan, the 
Beneficiary shall be the following, in order of priority: 
 
          (a)     The Participant's surviving spouse. 
 
          (b)     The Participant's surviving children in equal shares. 
 
          (c)    The beneficiaries designated by the Participant under 
the Company's LifeTrek program. 
 
          (d)    The Participant's estate. 
 
     6.4    If a surviving spouse or permanent partner Beneficiary is 
receiving installments and dies when a balance remains, the balance 
shall be paid in a lump sum to the spouse's or permanent partner's 
estate. 
 
     6.5    A designation of a spouse beneficiary by a Participant who 
is subsequently divorced from that spouse shall be automatically revoked 
by the divorce unless the Participant renews the designation after the 
divorce. 
 
     7.     Change of Control.
 
     7.1    Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5 and 6, the 
Payment Amount shall be paid to each Participant, or to the Beneficiary 
of each deceased Participant, in a lump sum within 30 days after the 
date of a Change of Control. 
 
     7.2    A "Change of Control" means any of the following: 
 
          (a)     The purchase or other acquisition by any person, 
entity or group of persons, within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act), or any comparable 
successor provisions, or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of 
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Act) of 30 percent or more of either 
the outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of 
the Company's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote 
generally. 
 
          (b)     The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a 
reorganization, merger, or consolidation with respect to which persons 
who were stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such 
reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, 
own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power entitled to vote 
generally in the election of directors of the reorganized, merged or 
consolidated Company's then outstanding securities.
 
          (c)     A liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
 
          (d)     A sale of all or substantially all of the Company's 
assets.  
 
     8.     Withdrawals. 
 
     8.1    A Participant or a surviving spouse or permanent partner 
Beneficiary may withdraw vested amounts from the Accounts before those 
amounts would otherwise have been paid because of Financial Hardship, as 
determined by the Committee.  The withdrawal shall be limited to the 
amount reasonably necessary to meet the Financial Hardship. 
 
     8.2    "Financial Hardship" means a Participant's or a surviving 
spouse or permanent partner Beneficiary's immediate and substantial 
financial need that cannot be met from other reasonably available 
resources and is caused by one or more of the following: 

          (a)     Medical expenses for the Participant or Beneficiary, a 
member of the Participant's or Beneficiary's immediate family or 
household, or other dependent. 
 
          (b)     Loss of or damage to a Participant's or Beneficiary's 
possessions or property due to casualty. 
 
          (c)     Other extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances 
arising from events beyond the Participant's or Beneficiary's control. 
 
     8.3    The Committee shall establish guidelines and procedures for 
implementing withdrawals.  An application shall be written, be signed by 
the Participant or the surviving spouse or permanent partner Beneficiary 
and include a statement of facts causing the Financial Hardship and any 
other facts required by the Committee. 
 
     8.4    The withdrawal date shall be fixed by the Committee.  The 
Committee may require a minimum advance notice and may limit the amount, 
time and frequency of withdrawals. 
 
     9.     Amendment; Termination.
 
     9.1    The Company may amend this Plan effective the first day of 
any month by notice to the Participants, except the rate of Interest 
credited under 3.2 may not be reduced without the consent of a 
Participant as to the balance in the Participant's Account as of the 
date of the reduction. 
 
     9.2    At any time the Company may terminate the Plan and pay out 
all Accounts to the Participants or Beneficiaries entitled to the 
Payment Amounts and thereby discharge all the benefit obligations of the 
Plan.  Upon such termination any assets remaining in the trust provided 
for in Section 4 shall be returned to the Company. 
 
     9.3    If the Internal Revenue Service issues a final ruling that 
any amounts deferred under this Plan will be subject to current income 
tax, all amounts to which the ruling is applicable shall be paid to the 
Participants within 30 days. 
 
     10.     Claims Procedure.
 
     10.1    Any person claiming a benefit or requesting an 
interpretation, ruling or information under the Plan shall present the 
request in writing to the Committee, which shall respond in writing as 
soon as practicable. 
 
     10.2    If the claim or request is denied, the written notice of 
denial shall state: 
 
          (a)     The reasons for denial, with specific reference to the 
Plan provisions on which the denial is based. 
 
          (b)     A description of any additional materials or 
information required and an explanation of why it is necessary. 
 
          (c)     An explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.
 
     10.3    The initial notice of denial shall normally be given within 
90 days of receipt of the claim.  If special circumstances require an 
extension of time, the claimant shall be so notified and the time limit 
shall be 180 days.
 
     10.4    Any person whose claim or request is denied or who has not 
received a response within 30 days may request review by notice in 
writing to the Committee.  The original decision shall be reviewed by 
the Committee, which may, but shall not be required to, grant the 
claimant a hearing.  On review, whether or not there is a hearing, the 
claimant may have representation, examine pertinent documents and submit 
issues and comments in writing. 
 
     10.5    The decision on review shall ordinarily be made within 60 
days.  If an extension of time is required for a hearing or other 
special circumstances, the claimant shall be so notified and the time 
limit shall be 120 days.  The decision shall be in writing and shall 
state the reasons and the relevant plan provisions.  All decisions on 
review shall be final and bind all parties concerned. 
 
     11.     General Provisions.
 
     11.1    If suit or action is instituted to enforce any rights under 
this Plan, the prevailing party may recover from the other party 
reasonable attorneys' fees at trial and on any appeal. 
 
     11.2    Any notice under this Plan shall be in writing and shall be 
effective when actually delivered or, if mailed, when deposited as first 
class mail postage prepaid.  Mail shall be directed to the Company at 
the address stated in this Plan, to the Participant's last known home 
address shown in the Company's records, or to such other address as a 
party may specify by notice to the other parties.  Notices to an 
Employer or the Committee shall be sent to the Company's address. 
 
     11.3    The rights of a Participant under this Plan are personal.  
Except for the limited provisions of Section 6, no interest of a 
Participant or one claiming through a Participant may be directly or 
indirectly assigned, transferred or encumbered and no such interest 
shall be subject to seizure by legal process or in any other way 
subjected to the claims of any creditor. 
 
     11.4    Following termination of employment, a Participant shall 
not be an employee of an Employer or an affiliate for any purpose, and 
payments under Sections 5 and 6 shall not constitute salary or wages.  
A Participant shall receive such payments as retirement benefits, not as 
compensation for performance of any substantial services. 
 
     11.5    Amounts payable under this Plan shall be an obligation of 
the Company and the Trust provided by Section 4.  If an Employer merges, 
consolidates, or otherwise reorganizes or if its business or assets are 
acquired by another company, this Plan shall continue with respect to 
those eligible individuals who continue in the employ of the successor 
company.  The transition of Employers shall not be considered a 
termination of employment for purposes of this Plan.  In such an event, 
however a successor corporation may terminate this Plan as to its 
Participants on the effective date of the succession by notice to 
Participants within 30 days after the succession. 
 
     11.6    The Committee may decide that because of the mental or 
physical condition of a person entitled to payments, or because of other 
relevant factors, it is in the person's best interest to make payments 
to others for the benefit of the person entitled to payment.  In that 
event, the Committee may in its discretion direct that payments be made 
as follows: 
 
          (a)     To a parent or spouse or a child of legal age; 
 
          (b)     To a legal guardian; or 
 
          (c)     To one furnishing maintenance, support, or 
hospitalization. 
 
     12.     Effective Date 
 
This Restatement shall be effective June 1, 1995, except as follows.  
The changes in 2.1 on eligibility to defer compensation shall be 
effective June 1, 1996 for eligibility in the Plan Year beginning on 
that date.  The change in 2.2 to base deferral of bonuses on the 
election for the Plan Year in which the bonus is paid shall first apply 
to the bonus paid in the Plan Year beginning on June 1, 1996.
