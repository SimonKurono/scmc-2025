Basis of Presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial 
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations 
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 1996 are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 
 
     Net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average 
number of common and common equivalent (stock option) shares outstanding 
for the period(s).  
 
     On October 30, 1995 the Company issued additional shares in connection 
with a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend 
on outstanding Class A and Class B common stock.  The per common share amounts 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been 
adjusted to reflect this stock split. 
 
     In September of 1996, the Company's Board of Directors announced a

NOTE 5 - Change in year-end of certain subsidiaries: 
          __________________________________________ 
 
     Prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of the Company's international 
operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag 
which allowed more time to compile results.  The Company has taken steps 
to improve its internal reporting procedures that has allowed for 
more timely reporting of these operations.  Beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.  As a 
result, the May 1996 loss from operations for these entities of 
$4.1 million was recorded directly to retained earnings.  The change 
affected the quarterly reporting periods for these operations and thus the 
income statement and cash flow statement have been presented to show 
comparable results for the quarter as if the change would have occurred 
in the prior year.  The effect of the change is not material to the 
consolidated balance sheet and as a result the balance sheet as of 
May 31, 1996 has not been adjusted. 
 
 
Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
     Net income increased 24% over the prior year's first quarter 
to $226.1 million, or $1.53 per share, from $182.1 million, or 
$1.25 per share.  Revenues totaled $2.28 billion, up 34% from $1.70 
billion in last year's first quarter, the first time that revenues 
exceeded $2 billion in one quarter.  This period also marks the eighth 
straight quarter of double digit increases in total revenues.  Gross 
margin percentage remained consistent with the prior year's first 
quarter.  Selling and administrative expenses were 23.2% of 
revenue compared to 21.7% in the prior year. 
 
     Revenues for the quarter increased $581.9 million over the $1.7 
billion reported in the same period of the prior year.  U.S. revenues 
increased $380 million, or 39%.  U.S. apparel increased 93% over last 
year's first quarter, the second consecutive quarter that U.S. apparel 
exceeded $200 million in revenues and the first time revenues 
exceeded $1 billion on a trailing twelve month basis.  U.S. footwear 
increased $210.5 million, or 26.6%, over last year due to a 24% increase 
in pairs sold and a 3% increase in average selling price.  These 
increases were primarily due to men's basketball, up 48%, and women's 
business, up 38%.  Golf increased 124%.  For the quarter, international 
revenue increased $202.8 million, or 35%, over last year. All regions 
showed double digit increases with Europe up 29%, Asia Pacific up 50% 
and the Americas region up 36%.  The effect of exchange rates decreased 
the quarter's international revenues $55 million, or 10%, compared to 
the prior year.  Other brands, which includes Cole Haan (R), Tetra 
Plastics, Sports Specialties and Bauer Inc., decreased slightly, $1.3 
million, or 1%.  The breakdown of revenues follows:

(1) For comparable purposes with 1996, results for the three months ended 
August 31, 1995 have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the 
one month lag in reporting by certain of the Company's international 
operations.  See further discussion under Note 5. 
 
     Consolidated gross margin percentage remained relatively flat at 
40.3% for the quarter compared to 40.4% for last year's first quarter, 
due to continued strong demand for NIKE products worldwide combined 
with sound inventory management.  The Company continues to place strong 
emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange risk and 
production sourcing in order to maximize gross profit.  Gross profit 
percentages for the remainder of fiscal year 1997 are expected to be 
affected by strong demand for NIKE products offset by continued 
increased levels of air freight to meet the delivery dates on increasing 
customer orders.  The gross profit percentage for the full year is 
expected to approximate last fiscal year's percentage.* 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $160 million over 
the previous year's first quarter and increased as a percent of sales 
to 23.2%, compared to 21.7% in last year's first quarter.  The majority 
of the increase in absolute dollars and percentage increases occurred in 
the U.S. and Europe due to planned marketing and advertising 
expenditures relating to the Olympics and the European soccer 
championships.  It is expected that selling and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year will approximate last 
year's level.* 
 
     Interest expense increased slightly over the prior 
year due to increased short term borrowings for increased operations.  
The Company's Japanese subsidiary entered into a new long-term debt 
arrangement, as further discussed below.
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38.7% 
compared to 38.5% in the prior year's first quarter.  The slight 
increase was due to higher tax on foreign earnings.  The Company 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1997 will remain at 
approximately 38.7%.* 
 
     Worldwide future and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic 
footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from September 1996 
through January 1997 were approximately $3.5 billion, 66% higher than 
such orders booked in the comparable period of the prior year.*  These 
orders and the percentage growth in these orders are not necessarily 
indicative of the growth in revenues which the Company will experience 
for the subsequent periods.  This is because the mix of advance futures 
and "at once" orders has shifted significantly toward furtures orders as 
the NIKE brand became more established in all areas, specifically in the 
U.S. apparel business and in international regions.  The mix of advance 
orders to "at once" orders will continue to vary as the U.S. apparel 
business and international operations continue to account for a greater 
percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on futures 
programs.*  Finally, exchange rates can cause differences in the 
comparisons. 
 
     As further explained in Note 5, prior to fiscal year 1997, certain 
of the Company's international operations reported their results of 
operations on a one month lag which allowed more time to compile 
results.  The Company has taken steps to improve its internal reporting 
procedures that has allowed for more timely reporting of these 
operations.  Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one 
month lag was eliminated.  The May 1996 loss from operations for these 
entities of $4.1 million was recorded directly to retained earnings.  
The income statement and cash flow statement for the quarter ended 
August 31, 1995 have been presented as if these entities reported on 
a same month basis.  There was no unusual activity in the month of May 
1996 for the entities affected by the change to concurrent month reporting. 
The cash flow for the month was impacted mainly by changes in working 
capital components due to increased operations. 
 
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
_______________________________ 
 
     The Company's financial position remains strong at August 31, 1996.  
Since May 31, 1996, total assets grew $474 million to approximately $4.4 
billion and shareholder's equity increased $226 million to nearly $2.7 
billion.  Working capital increased $257 million as a result of higher 
levels of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable offset by increased 
notes payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. The Company's 
current ratio increased compared to May 31, 1996 from 1.86:1 to 1.93:1. 
 
    Since May 31, 1996, cash and equivalents increased $136 million (52%) 
and accounts receivable increased $281 million (21%) due to the high 
level of first quarter revenues compared to the same period in the prior 
year.  Inventory levels decreased $22 million from May 31, the most 
significant change coming from U.S. footwear which decreased $47 million 
due to the large selling season.
 
     Current liabilities increased $160 million from May 31, 1996, with 
the most significant increases occurring in notes payable ($94 million) 
and accrued liabilities ($45 million) due to higher a level of operations 
and income taxes payable ($62 million) due to timing of tax payments. 
 
     Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first quarter of 
fiscal 1997 were $74 million with the most significant components 
related to the continued consolidation of European footwear warehouses, 
the expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and the expansion of warehouses 
in the U.S. 
 
     Long-term debt increased $98 million from May 31, 1996.  The increase 
was due almost entirely to the Company's Japanese subsidiary which borrowed 
10.5 billion Japanese yen in a private placement with a maturity of 
June 26, 2011. 
 
     Dividends per share of common stock for the first quarter of fiscal 
1997 was $.15 per share compared to $.125 per share for the first 
quarter of fiscal 1996.    
 
     In September of 1996, the Company's Board of Directors announced a 
two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to 
be paid on October 23, 1996 to shareholders of record on October 11, 1996.
 
     The Company's commercial paper program requires the support of 
committed and uncommitted lines of credit.  There was $88 million 
outstanding under this program at August 31, 1996.  The Company has 
$500 million available in committed unused lines of credit and, at 
August 31, 1996, no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility. 
NIKE's debt-to-equity ratio at August 31, 1996 was .7:1, compared to 
 .6:1 at May 31, 1996. 
 
     Management believes that funds generated by operations, together 
with currently available resources and anticipated long-term debt 
arrangements, will continue to adequately finance anticipated fiscal 
1997 expenditures.* 
 
*The marked items are forward-looking statements that involve risks 
and uncertainties detailed from time to time in reports filed by 
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K.
