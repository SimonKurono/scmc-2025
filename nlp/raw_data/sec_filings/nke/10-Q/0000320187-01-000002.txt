              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies:
         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations
for the six (6) months ended November 30, 2000 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2001 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 3 - Net income per common share:
         ___________________________

     Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with
SFAS 128, "Earnings per Share."  This standard requires that basic earnings
per share be calculated using the average common shares outstanding.  Diluted
earnings per share are calculated by taking into consideration the dilutive
effect of issued and outstanding stock options.  Options to purchase 9.7
million and 5.4 million shares of common stock were outstanding at November
30, 2000 and November 30, 1999, respectively but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of common shares and,
therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.  The following represents a
reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share:

NOTE 5 - Operating Segments:

     The Company's major operating segments are defined by geographic regions
for subsidiaries participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.  Other Brands as
shown below represent activity for Cole-Haan Holdings, Inc., Bauer NIKE
Hockey, Inc., and NIKE IHM, Inc. and are considered immaterial for individual
disclosure.  In prior years, the Company's operations in Africa were included
in the Americas region, but effective June 1, 2000, these operations are
included in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region.  Africa
information and certain other prior year segment information has been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.  Where applicable,
"Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to the consolidated
financial statements which generally include corporate activity and corporate
eliminations.  The segments are evidence of the structure of the enterprise's
internal organization.  Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates
predominantly in one industry:  the design, production, marketing and selling
of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on Contribution Profit before Corporate Allocations,
Interest Expense and Income Taxes.  On a consolidated basis, this amount
represents Income Before Taxes less Interest Expense as shown in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.  Other reconciling items for Contribution
Profit represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting and intercompany eliminations for specific
income statement items.

     Accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets for operating segments
are regularly reviewed and therefore provided:

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION

Operating Results
_________________


     Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2001 was $119.4 million,
an 11% increase over the $107.5 million reported in the second quarter of
fiscal year 2000. Fiscal year-to-date net income increased 7% to $329.6
million. The increase in net income for the second quarter was driven by a 7%
increase in revenues and by favorable other income/expense results. These
factors were partially offset by a 30 basis point reduction in gross margin
percentage, increased selling and administrative expenses and higher interest
expense. The 7% increase in year-to-date net income was driven by a 6% increase
in revenues, a 90 basis point improvement in gross margin percentage and
foreign exchange gains reported in other income/expense. These factors were
partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses, and higher
interest expense. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% in the quarter and
11% year-to-date. Due to share repurchases, fewer shares were outstanding at
the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2001 than at the end of the year-ago
quarter.  As a result, earnings per share grew faster than net income.

     Had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant, increases in
revenues for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date of 7% and 6%, respectively,
would have been 12% and 10%, respectively.  The lower real dollar increases
primarily reflected the impact of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar
against the euro.

     Each geographic region achieved revenue growth in the quarter and in the
first half of the fiscal year. The U.S. region, which represents 54% of NIKE
brand revenues, grew 5% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. For the quarter,
U.S. footwear revenues declined 2% while apparel revenues grew 13%. Year-to-
date, U.S. footwear revenues declined 1% while apparel revenues grew 5%.  U.S.
equipment revenues grew 63% and 59%, respectively, for the second quarter and
year-to-date periods. Equipment revenues represented approximately 7% of U.S.
region revenues during these periods. Second quarter revenues in the U.S.
reflect footwear declines in the moderate price segments, but better
performance in the athletic specialty and urban accounts; apparel sales
recovery and growth, particularly in the team replica and women's apparel
business; and strong equipment sales growth driven by the increased popularity
of our golf balls, bags and socks.

     International regions accounted for 46% of NIKE brand revenues in the
second quarter, up from 45% in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year.
Footwear, apparel and equipment revenues increased in all international
regions during the quarter and fiscal year-to-date. For the quarter, revenues
in the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region grew 2%, reflecting a 23%
increase in constant dollars partially offset by the effects of the weak euro.
Year-to-date, revenues in this region grew 5%, an increase of 21% in constant
dollars. These results reflected growth in the footwear, apparel and equipment
businesses, driven by the strength of our brand across the region.  In the
Asia Pacific region, revenues grew 20% in the quarter, an increase of 22% in
constant dollars. Year-to-date, revenues in this region grew 23%, an increase
of 21% in constant dollars. These results reflected strong footwear, apparel
and equipment sales in most countries in the region.  Revenue growth in Japan
was especially strong.  In the Americas region, revenues grew 14% both in real
and constant dollars in the quarter. Year-to-date revenues in this region were
also 14% higher this year, 15% on a constant dollar basis.  The strength of the
brand in Mexico and across the region, combined with the conversion benefits of
the 1999 of Brazil footwear sales from distributors to direct NIKE sales, drove
this revenue growth.

     Compared to last year, other brands revenue (which includes Bauer NIKE
Hockey and Cole Haan) increased 7% for the quarter and 4% for the fiscal
year-to-date period.

</TABLE>


     The gross margin percentage for the second quarter was 39.6% compared to
39.9% in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. The primary driver of
this reduction was foreign exchange rates. Our international revenues are
primarily denominated in foreign currencies whereas a substantial portion of
our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge most significant
foreign exchange exposures through foreign exchange contracts, but the entire
impact of foreign exchange rates, positive or negative, may not immediately
affect the prices we charge customers. For the second quarter, foreign exchange
rates adversely affected results in the EMEA region; however this was partially
offset by positive exchange rate effects in the Asia Pacific and Americas
regions.

     On a global basis, footwear experienced gross margin percentage
reductions while apparel experienced improved gross margins in the quarter.
Equipment gross margins did not change significantly.  Foreign exchange rates
were the most significant factor generating reductions in footwear gross
margins.  Although some apparel is purchased locally and therefore not subject
to foreign currency fluctuations, apparel margins were still negatively
affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.  However, fewer close-outs,
improved retail margins, and higher net pricing margins (largely the result
of a better product mix in EMEA) drove a net improvement in worldwide apparel
margins for the quarter.

     The fiscal year-to-date gross margin percentage was 40.1%, compared to
39.2% for the same period in the previous fiscal year.  This increase is
attributable to improvements in the U.S., Asia Pacific and America regions
offset by lower margins for the EMEA region. The effect of foreign exchange
rates was the most significant factor on regional gross margins for this
period.  On a global basis, apparel gross margins improved while equipment
reported reduced gross margins. Footwear gross margins did not change
significantly. The factors leading to the improvements in apparel gross
margins for the fiscal year-to-date period were the same as described above.
The equipment gross margin percentage was adversely affected by higher close-
outs and lower net pricing margins.

     Selling and administrative expenses increased for both the quarter and
fiscal year-to-date period compared to the prior year. For the quarter, these
expenses were up 8% to $673.1 million, and year-to-date they were up 10% to
$1,374.2 million.  The increases, for both the quarter and the year-to-date
period, were driven primarily by incremental spending for marketing and
operational initiatives undertaken to achieve future revenue growth and
profitability. Marketing initiatives focused on the 2000 Summer Olympics, the
2000 European Soccer Championships, and soccer investments in the Americas
region, where we have increased our on-field presence through additional club
and individual player sponsorships.  Operational initiatives included
continued expansion of new retail outlets; the development of e-commerce;
investments in systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain;
and expansion of NIKE distribution to territories formerly served by
independent distributors.  Partially offsetting these increases was a
reduction in bad debt expense.

     Second quarter interest expense increased by $10.0 million versus last
year, to $16.7 million. Fiscal year-to-date interest expense increased $15.4
million versus last year, to $32.1 million. The increases in current quarter
and year-to-date interest costs were due to higher average levels of debt in
the first half of fiscal 2001 versus the prior year. The Company increased
debt during the second half of fiscal 2000, primarily to fund capital
expenditures, repurchase stock, and finance inventory previously financed by
our trading partner, Nissho Iwai American Corporation.  See the Liquidity and
Capital Resources discussion following for more information on debt balances.

     Other income/expense for the quarter was net income of $6.4 million,
compared to net expense for the same quarter of last year of $16.8 million.
Year-to-date, other income/expense was net expense of $13.6 million, compared
to $23.7 million in the prior year.  The improvement for both the quarter and
year-to-date is primarily attributable to gains from hedging intercompany
charges and net gains from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on recorded assets and liabilities.  These assets and liabilities
include amounts due to and from third parties, intercompany assets and
liabilities, and foreign exchange contracts. The hedging of intercompany
charges generally produces
gains in an environment where the U.S. dollar is strengthening, and losses in
an environment where the U.S. dollar is weakening, based on how and when the
intercompany charges are computed and ultimately paid. The effects of
fluctuations between the British pound and the euro, and between the euro and
the U.S. dollar, were the most significant.

     Our tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date was 36.5%. This rate
compares to 38.0% for the quarter and year-to-date period in the prior year.
This decrease was primarily due to increased utilization of tax loss
carryforwards of certain foreign operations and lower taxes on a portion of
foreign earnings that have been permanently reinvested offshore.

Futures Orders

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear
and apparel scheduled for delivery between December 2000 and April 2001
totaled $3.6 billion, 1% lower than the same period last year.  On a constant
dollar basis, worldwide futures and advance orders for these same periods were
3% higher in the current year. These orders and the relative change in these
orders between years are not necessarily indicative of the change in revenues
that we will experience for subsequent periods. This is due to potential
shifts in the mix of advance orders in relation to at-once orders, and varying
cancellation rates. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can also cause
differences in the comparisons.

Euro Conversion

     On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the
European Union established permanent, fixed conversion rates between their
existing currencies and the European Union's new common currency, the euro.
During the transition period ending December 31, 2001, public and private
parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the
participating country's legacy currency. Beginning January 1, 2002, euro
denominated bills and coins will be issued; the legacy currencies will be
completely withdrawn from circulation on June 30, 2002.

     We have had a dedicated project team working on the euro transition
strategy since January 1998. We have made modifications to information
technology systems supporting marketing, order management, purchasing,
invoicing, payroll, and cash management functions, in order to make them euro
compliant. All major systems have been converted and are euro compliant, well
ahead of the end of the transitional period.

     We believe the introduction of the euro may create a move towards a
greater level of wholesale price harmonization, although differing country
costs and value added tax rates will continue to result in price differences
at the retail level. Over the past year and a half, we have been actively
working to assess and, where necessary, adjust pricing practices to operate
effectively in this new environment.

     The costs of adapting our systems and practices to the implementation of
the euro were generally related to the modification of existing systems and
total approximately $8 million. These costs were expensed as incurred. NIKE
believes that the conversion to the euro will not have a material impact on
our financial condition or results of operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standard

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133).  In May 1999, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board delayed the required implementation date by one
year, extending our implementation date to June 1, 2001. In June 2000, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities--an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" (FAS 138).  FAS
133, as amended, will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value.  We will record changes in the fair value of derivatives
in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the intended
use of the derivative and any resulting designation.  We will recognize the
ineffective portion of all hedges in current-period earnings.  Management is
in the process of determining the complete effect that the adoption of FAS 133
will have on NIKE's results of operations and financial position. The
significance of the FAS 133 transition adjustment is contingent upon the fair
values of derivatives outstanding on adoption date and the impact the changes
in accounting will have on balances recorded as of the transition date.
Because this information is based on future market rates and both current and
future transactions, no determination of the materiality of the adjustment can
be made at this time.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Our financial position remained strong at November 30, 2000. Compared to
May 31, 2000, shareholders' equity increased by 7% to $3.4 billion. Working
capital increased 14% to $1.7 billion and the current ratio was 1.90:1 at
November 30, 2000 compared to 1.68:1 at May 31, 2000. The increase in working
capital and the increase in current ratio resulted primarily from lower
current liabilities than at May 31, 2000.

     Cash provided by operations for the six-month period ended November 30,
2000 was $306.0 million, which was a decrease of $260.1 million from the same
period last year, despite increased net income of $21.8 million in the current
period. The decrease in operating cash flow occurred due to variances in our
working capital. During the six-month period ended November 30, 2000 other
working capital components increased $128.9 million whereas in the six-month
period ended November 30, 1999 other working capital components decreased by
$147.7 million.

     Total cash flows used by investing activities during the six month
period were $145.5 million. A significant portion of this total expenditure
was for computer equipment and software, driven by our supply chain
initiative; investments in new retail outlets; and the continued expansion of
our world headquarters.

     Net cash flows used by financing activities for the six months ended
November 30, 2000 were $139.2 million. This amount included uses of cash for
stock repurchases, dividends to shareholders and payment of a maturing note
payable.  This was partially offset by proceeds from employee stock option
exercises.

     We believe that the significant cash flow generated by operations,
together with access to external sources of funds, will be adequate to meet
our anticipated capital needs. We maintain significant short and long-term
lines of credit with banks, which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate
operating liquidity. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper
program, under which there was $735.1 million outstanding at November 30,
2000. During the second quarter, we entered into a new $1.25 billion committed
credit facility with a group of banks: $750.0 million has a maturity of 364
days from the borrowing date and $500.0 million has a maturity of five years
from the borrowing date. To date, we have not borrowed against the facility.
Each year both facilities can be extended for an additional year. Our
long-term debt rating is now A2 and A by Moody's Investor Service and
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively.

     In the second quarter of fiscal year 2001, we purchased a total of 0.9
million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $33 million. These purchases
were made under a four-year, $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by
our Board of Directors at the beginning the current fiscal year. Funding for
repurchases has, and is expected to continue to come primarily from operating
cash flow. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by
working capital needs and stock market conditions.

     Dividends per share of common stock for the second quarter of fiscal year
2001 remained at $0.12 per share, the same level as the previous year.



Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There were no material changes to the disclosure made in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2000 regarding this
matter.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference
from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other
reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("the Act").  Forward-
looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict,
forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and
may contain the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project,"
"will be," "will continue," "will result," or words or phrases of similar
meaning.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may
cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed
by NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include,
among others, the following:  international, national and local general
economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic
footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; the
size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; fluctuations and
difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation,
the fact that advance "futures" orders may not be indicative of future
revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-once orders; the ability
of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; new product
development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks,
patents, and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of
products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant
customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions;
increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines;
changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated
with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation,
import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes
in government regulations; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE;
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors
referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this
report may include additional factors which could adversely impact NIKE's
business and financial performance.  Moreover, NIKE operates in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from
time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk
factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual
results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information.  Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report.  Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.  Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

                             STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
                       NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

       THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT is made as of _______________, 2000 between
NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and ________________ (the
"Optionee").

       On __________________, 2000 the Compensation Plan Subcommittee of the
Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. instructed the Company to grant Optionee a
stock option (the "Option") under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the
"Plan") and on the terms and conditions set forth below and in the Plan.

       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

       1.    The Company hereby grants Optionee the right and option to
purchase all or any part of an aggregate of ______ shares (the "Shares") of the
Company's authorized and unissued Class B Common Stock at the exercise price of
$________ per Share.

       2.    Subject to reductions in the Option period as provided in the
Plan in the event of termination of service or death of Optionee, the Option
shall continue in effect through ____________, 20__.  Optionee's right to
purchase the Shares pursuant to the Option shall accrue with respect to 100% of
the Shares on the first anniversary date of this Agreement.  Once acquired,
such rights shall continue for as long as the Option remains in effect.
Optionee's accrued rights under the Option may be exercised from time to time
in whole or in part for as long as the option remains in effect, provided that
the Option may not be exercised for fractional shares.

      3.    The Company hereby designates the Option to be a non-statutory
stock option rather than an Incentive Stock Option, as defined in Section 422A
of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      4.    As a condition to the grant of the Option and the issuance of
Shares covered by the Option, Optionee agrees to timely pay, without
reimbursement by the Company, all national and local taxes at any time imposed
on, or required to be withheld by the Company as a result of, the grant,
vesting, exercise, or sale of the Option or the Shares.

      5.   All rights hereunder are subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Plan.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Stock Option
Agreement in duplicate as of the day and year written above.

NIKE, Inc.                                      Optionee

        discretion and not subject to the amount of its Facility A Commitment,

                (a)    Facility A.  Each Ratable Facility A Advance hereunder
shall consist of borrowings made from the several Facility A Banks ratably in
proportion to the amounts of their respective Facility A Commitments.  The
aggregate outstanding amount of Competitive Facility A Bid Advances shall
reduce each Facility A Bank's Facility A Commitment ratably in the proportion
such Facility A Bank's Facility A Commitment bears to the Facility A
Commitments regardless of which Facility A Bank or Facility A Banks make such
Competitive Facility A Bid Advances.  No Facility A Bank shall be obligated to
make a Facility A Loan hereunder if the aggregate principal amount of such
Bank's Facility A Loans outstanding would exceed its Facility A Commitment.
Ratable Facility A Advances shall be evidenced by the Ratable Facility A Notes.

                (b)    Facility B.  Each Ratable Facility B Advance hereunder
shall consist of borrowings made from the several Facility B Banks ratably in
proportion to the amounts of their respective Facility B Commitments.  The
aggregate outstanding amount of Competitive Facility B Bid Advances shall
reduce each Facility B Bank's Facility B Commitment ratably in the proportion
such Facility B Bank's Facility B Commitment bears to the Facility B
Commitments regardless of which Facility B Bank or Facility B Banks make such
Competitive Facility B Bid Advances.  No Facility B Bank shall be obligated to
make a Facility B Loan hereunder if the aggregate principal amount of its
Facility B Loans outstanding would exceed such Bank's Facility B Commitment.
Ratable Facility B Advances shall be evidenced by the Ratable Facility B Notes.

        2.2.2.   Ratable Advance Rate Options.  The Ratable Advances may be
Floating Rate Advances or Eurodollar Ratable Advances, or a combination
thereof, selected by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2.3, and as
converted or continued in accordance with Section 2.2.4; provided that (a) no
Facility A Advance may mature after the Facility A Termination Date, and (b) no
Facility B Advance may mature after the Facility B Termination Date.
        2.2.3.   Method of Selecting Rate Options and Interest Periods for

(San Francisco time) (a) on the Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date of

Advance or a Ratable Facility B Advance;
                (b)    the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of
such Ratable Advance;
                (c)    the aggregate amount of such Ratable Advance;

                (e)    in the case of each Fixed Rate Advance, the Interest
Period applicable thereto (which may not end after the Applicable Termination
Date).
        2.2.4.  Conversion and Continuation Elections.
                (a)   Subject to subsection 2.2.4(d), the Borrower may, upon
irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
subsection 2.2.4(b):  (i) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of a
Floating Rate Advance, or as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
in the case of a Eurodollar Ratable Advance, to convert such Advance into an
Advance bearing interest based on another Rate Option; or (ii) elect, as of the
last day of the applicable Interest Period, to continue a Eurodollar Ratable
Advance or Floating Rate Advance having an Interest Period expiring on such
day; except, that during the existence of a Default or Unmatured Default, the
Borrower may not elect to have any Advance converted into or continued as a
Eurodollar Ratable Advance unless (1) with respect to any conversion or
continuation of a Facility A Advance, the Majority Facility A Banks consent
thereto, or (2) with respect to any conversion or continuation of a Facility B
Advance, the Majority Facility B Banks consent thereto.  All conversions and
continuations of Advances shall be made ratably according to the respective
outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the notice was
given held by each Applicable Bank.
                (b)   The Borrower shall deliver a notice of
conversion/continuation in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (a "Notice of
Conversion/Continuation") to be received by the Administrative Agent not later
than 8:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) (i) on the Business Day preceding the

<PAGE>
continued as a Floating Rate Advance, and (ii) three Business Days before the
Conversion/Continuation Date if the Advance is to be converted into or
continued as a Eurodollar Ratable Advance; specifying:

                      (i)     whether such Ratable Advance to be converted or
                continued is a Facility A Advance or a Facility B Advance;

                      (ii)    the Conversion/Continuation Date, which shall be
                a Business Day, of such Ratable Advance;

                      (iii)  the aggregate amount of such Ratable Advance to
                be converted or continued;

                       (iv)   the Rate Option for such Ratable Advance
                resulting from the conversion or continuation; and

                        (v)   in the case of each Fixed Rate Advance, the
Interest Period applicable thereto (which may not end after the Applicable
Termination Date).

              (c)   If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
a Eurodollar Ratable Advance, the Borrower has failed to select timely a new
Interest Period to be applicable to such Advance, or if any Default or
Unmatured Default then
exists, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Advance
into a Floating Rate Advance effective as of the expiration date of such
Interest Period.

              (d)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Borrower may not (i) convert a Facility A Advance into a Facility B Advance, or
(ii) convert a Facility B Advance into a Facility A Advance.

       2.3.    Competitive Bid Advances.

       2.3.1.  Competitive Bid Option.  In addition to Ratable Advances
pursuant to Section 2.2, but subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including any limitations as to the maximum aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Facility A Advances and any limitations as to the
maximum aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Facility B Advances
hereunder), the Borrower may, as set forth in this Section 2.3, request the
Applicable Banks, prior to the Applicable Termination Date, to make offers to
make Competitive Bid Advances to the Borrower.  Each Applicable Bank may, but
shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall
have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this
Section 2.3.  Competitive Facility A Bid Advances shall be evidenced by the
Competitive Facility A Bid Notes and Competitive Facility B Bid Advances shall

request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans under this Section 2.3, it shall
transmit to the Administrative Agent by telecopy a Competitive Bid Quote

specifying:
              (a)   whether the Borrower is requesting offers to make

              (b)   the proposed Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day,
for the proposed Competitive Bid Advance;
              (c)  the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid

        The Borrower may request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans for more

Loans and offers to make Competitive Facility B Bid Loans in a single
Competitive Bid Quote Request.  No Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be given

Applicable Banks, such other number of days as the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent may agree) of any other Competitive Bid Quote Request.
Each Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be in Dollars in a minimum amount of

Competitive Bid Quote Request that does not conform substantially to the format
of Exhibit C hereto shall be rejected, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Borrower of such rejection by telecopy.
       2.3.3. Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes.  Promptly and in any event

              (a) Each Applicable Bank may, in its sole discretion, submit a

than, less than or equal to the Facility A Commitment or the Facility B
Commitment, as the case may be, of the quoting Bank, (2) must be at least
$5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (3) may not exceed the
principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers were requested,
                  (iv)  in the case of a Eurodollar Auction, the Competitive
Bid Margin offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan,
                  (v)   the minimum or maximum amount, if any, of the
Competitive Bid Loan which may be accepted by the Borrower,
                  (vi)  in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the Absolute

                  (vii) the identity of the quoting Bank.
              (c) The Administrative Agent shall reject any Competitive Bid
Quote that:
                  (i)   is not substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto or

                                      23
<PAGE>
                    (iii)  proposes terms other than or in addition to those
set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes; or
                    (iv)   arrives after the time set forth in Section
2.3.4(a).
       If any Competitive Bid Quote shall be rejected pursuant to this Section
2.3.4(c), then the Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Bank of such
rejection as soon as practical.
       2.3.5. Notice to Borrower.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower of the terms (i) of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by
an Applicable Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.3.4, and (ii) of any
Competitive Bid Quote that is in accordance with Section 2.3.4 and amends,
modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote
submitted by such Applicable Bank with respect to the same Competitive Bid
Quote Request.  Any such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote shall be disregarded
by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote
specifically states that it is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in
such former Competitive Bid Quote.  The Administrative Agent's notice to the
Borrower shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans
for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the
related Competitive Bid Quote Request and the respective principal amounts and
Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered.
       2.3.6. Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Not later than (i) 10:00 a.m.
(San Francisco time) at least three Business Days prior to the proposed
Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurodollar Auction, or (ii) 10:00 a.m. (San
Francisco time) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate
Auction (or, in either case upon reasonable prior notice to the Applicable
Banks, such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
may agree), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its
acceptance or rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section
2.3.5; provided, however, that the failure by the Borrower to give such notice
to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection of all such
offers.  In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Competitive Bid Borrowing
Notice") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each
Interest Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid
Quote in whole or in part (subject to the terms of Section 2.3.4(b)(v));
provided that:
              (a)  the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid
Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related
Competitive Bid Quote Request;
              (b)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
ascending Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and
              (c)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in
Section 2.3.4(c) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of
this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining a Competitive Bid Loan under this
Agreement.
       2.3.7. Allocation by Administrative Agent.  If offers are made by two or
more Banks with the same Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case
                                      24
<PAGE>

may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of
which offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount
of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be
allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible
(in such multiples, not less than $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may
deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such
offers; provided, however, that no Bank shall be allocated a portion of any
Competitive Bid Advance which is less than the minimum amount which such Bank
has indicated that it is willing to accept.  Allocations by the Administrative
Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly, but in any
event on the same Business Day, notify each Bank of its receipt of a
Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the aggregate principal amount of such
Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each participating Bank.
       2.4.   Fees.

       2.5.   General Facility Terms.

       2.5.1. Method of Borrowing.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco
time) on each Borrowing Date, each Bank shall make available its Loan or Loans
in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office.  Unless otherwise instructed by the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent shall deposit the funds so received from the Banks in
the Borrower's account at Bank of America's main office in San Francisco.

       2.5.2. Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Ratable Advance, and each
conversion and continuation with respect to a Ratable Advance, shall be in the
minimum amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in
excess thereof); provided, however, that (a) any Floating Rate Facility A
Advance may be in the aggregate amount of the unused Facility A Commitments,
and (b) any Floating Rate Facility B Advance may be in the aggregate amount of
the unused Facility B Commitments.
       2.5.3. Repayment.  Except for optional payments pursuant to Section
2.5.4, (a) each Competitive Bid Advance shall be paid in full by the Borrower
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (b) each Ratable
Advance shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, unless such Ratable Advance is converted or
continued in accordance with Section 2.2.4; provided that in any event all
Facility A Advances shall be paid in full on the Facility A Termination Date
and all Facility B Advances shall be paid in full on the Facility B Termination
Date (provided that if the Facility B Term Loans are made, the Facility B Term
Loans shall be paid in full on the Facility B Term Loan Maturity Date).
       2.5.4. Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may from time to time
pay all outstanding Ratable Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof), any portion
of the outstanding Ratable Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice to
the Administrative Agent.  All such payments shall be made in immediately
available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
Office by 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the date of payment.  A
Competitive Bid Advance may not be prepaid prior to the last day of its
applicable Interest Period without the prior consent of the Bank which
originally made such Loan, which consent may be given or withheld at the Bank's
sole and absolute discretion.  Any prepayment of a Fixed Rate Advance prior to
the end of an applicable Interest Period shall be subject to the
indemnification provided in Section 3.4.
       2.5.5. Interest Periods.  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.5.6,
each Advance shall bear interest from the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to the earlier of (a) the last day of such Interest Period,
or (b) the date of any earlier prepayment as permitted by Section 2.5.4, at the
interest rate determined as applicable to such Advance, subject to the
Borrower's right to convert or continue Ratable Advances pursuant to
Section 2.2.4.  The Borrower shall not request a Fixed Rate Advance if, after
giving effect to the requested Fixed Rate Advance, more than 20 separate Fixed
Rate Advances would be outstanding.
       2.5.6. Rate after Maturity.  Except as provided in the next sentence,
any Advance not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall
bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
                                      27
<PAGE>

Base Rate plus 1% per annum.  In the case of a Fixed Rate Advance the maturity
of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the
remainder of the applicable Interest Period, at the higher of (a) the rate
otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 1% per annum, or (b) the
Alternate Base Rate plus 1% per annum.
       2.5.7. Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis.  Interest accrued on each
Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period and
on any date on which such Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or
otherwise.  Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest
Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each
three-month interval during such Interest Period.  Interest on all Floating
Rate Advances calculated on the basis of the Base Rate shall be calculated on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual
number of days elapsed.  Interest on all other Advances shall be calculated for
the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the
actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to the payee
thereof than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days.  Interest shall be
payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on
the amount paid if payment is received prior to 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time)
at the place of payment.  If any payment of principal or interest on an Advance
shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.
       2.5.8. Method of Payment.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall
be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense,
recoupment or setoff, without prejudice to Borrower's right to later assert any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as specifically provided
in this Agreement and in the following sentence, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Banks to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m.
(San Francisco time) on the date when due and shall be applied (i) first,
ratably among the Applicable Banks with respect to any principal and interest
due in connection with Ratable Advances, (ii) second, after all amounts
described in clause (i) have been satisfied, ratably among those Applicable
Banks for whom any payment of principal and interest is due in connection with
any Competitive Bid Advances, and (iii) third, after all amounts described in
clauses (i) and (ii) have been satisfied, ratably to any other Obligations then
due to the Applicable Banks.  If such payment is received by the Administrative
Agent by 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) such delivery to the Banks shall be
made on the same day and if received thereafter shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to
charge the account of the Borrower held at Bank of America for each payment of
principal, interest and fees owing by the Borrower as it becomes due hereunder.
       2.5.9. Notes; Telephonic Notices; Designation of Borrower.  Each Bank is
hereby authorized to record on the schedule attached to each of its Notes, or
otherwise record in accordance with its usual practice, the date and amount of
each of its Loans of the type evidenced by such Note; provided, however, that
any failure to so record shall not affect the Borrower's Obligations under this
Agreement or any Note.  The Borrower hereby authorizes the Banks and the
Administrative Agent to extend, continue and convert Advances, effect Rate
Option selections and submit Competitive Bid Quotes based on telephonic notices
                                     28
<PAGE>
made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Bank in good
faith believes to be an authorized officer or an officer, employee or agent of
the Borrower designated by an authorized officer.  The Borrower agrees to
deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written or telecopy confirmation
of each telephonic notice signed by an authorized officer.  If the written or
telecopy confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Administrative Agent and the Banks, the records of the Administrative Agent
and the Banks shall govern absent manifest error.
       2.5.10. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments.  The
Administrative Agent will notify each Applicable Bank of the contents of each
Ratable Borrowing Notice, Notice of Conversion/Continuation (or automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 2.2.4(c)), and payment notice received by it
hereunder promptly and in any event (provided such items were timely received
by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower) before the close of business on
the same Business Day of receipt thereof (or, in the case of borrowing notices
with respect to Floating Rate Advances, within one hour of receipt thereof).
The Administrative Agent will notify each Applicable Bank of the interest rate
applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such
interest rate and will give each Applicable Bank prompt notice of each change
in the Alternate Base Rate in respect of any outstanding Floating Rate Advance.
       2.5.11. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the
Borrower or a Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior
to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative
Agent of (i) in the case of a Bank, the proceeds of a Loan, or (ii) in the case
of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Applicable Banks, that it does not intend to make
such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been
made.  The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the
amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon
such assumption.  If such Bank or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in
fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such
payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the
Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the
Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in
the case of payment by a Bank, the Federal Funds Rate for such day, or (y) in
the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the
relevant Loan.
       2.5.12. Cancellation.  The Borrower may, at any time after the Effective
Date, upon not less than five Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, terminate or permanently reduce the Facility A
Commitments and/or the Facility B Commitments in whole, or in a minimum
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof); unless, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of
Loans made on the effective date thereof, (a) with respect to any termination
or permanent reduction of the Facility A Commitments, the then-outstanding
principal amount of the Facility A Loans would exceed the amount of the
                                 29
<PAGE>
combined Facility A Commitments then in effect, or (b) with respect to any
termination or permanent reduction of the Facility B Commitments, the then-
outstanding principal amount of the Facility B Loans would exceed the amount of
the combined Facility B Commitments then in effect.  Any reduction of the
Facility A Commitments shall be applied to each Facility A Bank according to
its Facility A Pro Rata Share, and any reduction of the Facility B Commitments
shall be applied to each Facility B Bank according to its Facility B Pro Rata
Share.  All accrued commitment fees to, but not including, the effective date
of any reduction or termination of Commitments shall be paid on the effective
date of such reduction or termination.  Once the Facility A Commitments or the
Facility B Commitments are reduced in accordance with this Section, they may
not be increased.
       2.5.13. Lending Offices.  Each Bank may from time to time, by written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, change its
Lending Office and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
       2.6.    Extension of Facility A Termination Date.
               (a) The Borrower may, from time to time, by written notice to
the Administrative Agent (each such notice being a "Facility A Extension
Notice") given no later than 30 days but not sooner than 60 days prior to
November 17 of each year beginning 2001 (each such November 17 called an
"Extension Date"), extend the Facility A Termination Date to a date one year
after the then applicable Facility A Termination Date.  Such extension shall
not be effective with respect to a Facility A Bank which, by a notice (a
"Facility A Withdrawal Notice") to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
given within 30 days following the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
Facility A Extension Notice, declines to consent to such extension or which has
failed to respond to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent within said
30-day period (each Facility A Bank giving a Facility A Withdrawal Notice or
failing to respond in a timely manner being called a "Facility A Withdrawing
Bank" and each Facility A Bank other than a Facility A Withdrawing Bank being a
"Facility A Continuing Bank").  Such extension shall be effective only if the
aggregate of the Facility A Commitments of the Facility A Continuing Banks is
66-2/3% or more of the Facility A Commitments in effect on the date of this
Agreement.
               (b) If Facility A Banks with less than 66-2/3% of the Facility A
Commitments elect to be Facility A Continuing Banks, the Facility A Termination
Date shall not be extended and the Facility A Banks (including Facility A
Withdrawing Banks) shall be obligated to make Facility A Loans to the Borrower
in accordance with the original terms of this Agreement (including any
previously approved extensions).  If Facility A Banks with 66-2/3% or more, but
less than 100%, of the Facility A Commitments elect to be Facility A Continuing
Banks, the Borrower may, at any time prior to the then applicable Extension
Date, invite the Facility A Continuing Banks to increase their Facility A
Commitments and/or invite other banks to become party to the Agreement as
Facility A Banks in accordance with Section 13.3, in an aggregate amount not to
exceed the Facility A Commitments of the Facility A Withdrawing Banks.  If the
Borrower fails to receive new or increased Facility A Commitments equal to the
Facility A Commitments of the Facility A Withdrawing Banks prior to the then
applicable Extension Date, the Borrower may, at its option, elect to cancel the
requested extension of the Facility A Termination Date and the Facility A
Banks, including the Facility A Withdrawing Banks, shall continue to be
obligated to make Facility A Loans in accordance with the original terms of
this Agreement (including any previously approved extensions).  If the Borrower
                                       30
<PAGE>

receives the consent of Facility A Banks having 66-2/3% or more, but less than
100%, of the Facility A Commitments, and the Borrower elects not to cancel the
requested extension, the Facility A Termination Date shall be extended by one
year, provided, however, that the Facility A Commitment of each Facility A
Withdrawing Bank shall terminate on the then applicable Facility A Termination
Date without giving any effect to such extension.  In such event, the Borrower
shall pay in full all Facility A Loans outstanding from each Facility A
Withdrawing Bank on such Facility A Termination Date, provided, however, that
so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists, the Borrower may, at any
time prior to such Facility A Termination Date and by not less than five
Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and any
Facility A Withdrawing Bank, cancel such Facility A Bank's Facility A
Commitment, and thereupon prepay all Facility A Loans made by such Facility A
Bank, together with interest and fees accrued to the date of such prepayment
and breakage costs due under Section 3.4, if any, whereupon such Facility A
Bank shall cease to be obliged to make further Facility A Loans hereunder, its
Facility A Commitment shall be reduced to zero and it shall be released from
all unaccrued obligations with respect to Facility A Commitments under this
Agreement.

             (c) The Administrative Agent shall notify each Facility A Bank of
its receipt of a Facility A Extension Notice within two Business Days after the
Administrative Agent's receipt thereof.  The Borrower may deliver only one
Facility A Extension Notice per year.
             (d) Each Facility A Withdrawing Bank shall be obliged, at the
request of the Borrower and subject to the Facility A Withdrawing Bank
receiving payment in full of all amounts owing to it under this Agreement prior
to completion of an assignment, to assign, without recourse or warranty and by
an assignment agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit J attached hereto,
and in accordance with Section 13.3, all of its rights and obligations
hereunder to another financial institution which is an Eligible Assignee
nominated by the Borrower and willing to participate in the facility in the
place of such Facility A Withdrawing Bank; provided that such transferee
satisfies all the requirements of this Agreement.
              (e) If the Facility A Termination Date shall have been extended
in respect of Facility A Continuing Banks in accordance with this Section 2.6,
any Ratable Borrowing Notice or Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect
to any Facility A Loans or Facility A Advances specifying a Borrowing Date or
Conversion/Continuation Date occurring after the Facility A Termination Date
applicable to a Facility A Withdrawing Bank or requesting an Interest Period
extending beyond such date (i) shall have no effect in respect of such
Facility A Withdrawing Bank, and (ii) shall not specify a requested aggregate
principal amount exceeding, when combined with all then outstanding Facility A
Advances, the Facility A Commitments of the Facility A Continuing Banks.
               (f) If the Facility A Termination Date shall have been extended
in respect of Facility A Continuing Banks in accordance with this Section 2.6,
all references herein to the "Facility A Termination Date" shall, with respect
to all parties hereto other than Facility A Withdrawing Banks, refer to the
Facility A Termination Date as so extended.
                                       31
<PAGE>

       2.7.    Extension of Facility B Termination Date
               (a) The Borrower may, from time to time, by written notice to
the Administrative Agent (each such notice being a "Facility B Extension
Notice") given no later than 30 days but not sooner than 60 days prior to the
then applicable Facility B Termination Date, beginning November 16, 2001,
extend the Facility B Termination Date to a date 364 days after the then
applicable Facility B Termination Date.  Such extension shall not be effective
with respect to a Facility B Bank which, by a notice (a "Facility B Withdrawal
Notice") to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent given within 30 days
following the Administrative Agent's receipt of such Facility B Extension
Notice, declines to consent to such extension or which has failed to respond to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent within said 30-day period (each
Facility B Bank giving a Facility B Withdrawal Notice or failing to respond in
a timely manner being called a "Facility B Withdrawing Bank" and each
Facility B Bank other than a Facility B Withdrawing Bank being a "Facility B
Continuing Bank").  Such extension shall be effective only if the aggregate of
the Facility B Commitments of the Facility B Continuing Banks is 66-2/3% or
more of the Facility B Commitments in effect on the date of this Agreement.
               (b) If Facility B Banks with less than 66-2/3% of the Facility B
Commitments elect to be Facility B Continuing Banks, the Facility B Termination
Date shall not be extended and the Facility B Banks (including Facility B
Withdrawing Banks) shall be obligated to make Facility B Loans to the Borrower
in accordance with the original terms of this Agreement (including any
previously approved extensions and Advances pursuant to Section 2.8).  If
Facility B Banks with 66-2/3% or more, but less than 100%, of the Facility B
Commitments elect to be Facility B Continuing Banks, the Borrower may, at any
time prior to the then applicable Facility B Termination Date, invite the
Facility B Continuing Banks to increase their Facility B Commitments and/or
invite other banks to become party to the Agreement as Facility B Banks in
accordance with Section 13.3, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the
Facility B Commitments of the Facility B Withdrawing Banks.  If the Borrower
fails to receive new or increased Facility B Commitments equal to the
Facility B Commitments of the Facility B Withdrawing Banks prior to the then
applicable Facility B Termination Date, the Borrower may, at its option, elect
to cancel the requested extension of the Facility B Termination Date and the
Facility B Banks, including the Facility B Withdrawing Banks, shall continue to
be obligated to make Facility B Loans in accordance with the original terms of
this Agreement (including any previously approved extensions and Advances
pursuant to Section 2.8).  If the Borrower receives the consent of Facility B
Banks having 66-2/3% or more, but less than 100%, of the Facility B
Commitments, and the Borrower elects not to cancel the requested extension, the
Facility B Termination Date shall be extended by 364 days, provided, however,
that the Facility B Commitment of each Facility B Withdrawing Bank shall
terminate on the then applicable Facility B Termination Date without giving any
effect to such extension.  In such event, the Borrower shall pay in full all
Facility B Loans outstanding from each Facility B Withdrawing Bank on such
Facility B Termination Date, provided, however, that so long as no Default or
Unmatured Default exists, the Borrower may, at any time prior to such
Facility B Termination Date and by not less than five Business Days' prior
written notice to the Administrative Agent and any Facility B Withdrawing Bank,
cancel such Facility B Bank's Facility B Commitment, and thereupon prepay all
Facility B Loans made by such Facility B Bank, together with interest and fees
                                     32
<PAGE>

accrued to the date of such prepayment and breakage costs due under Section
3.4, if any, whereupon such Facility B Bank shall cease to be obliged to make
further Facility B Loans hereunder, its Facility B Commitment shall be reduced
to zero and it shall be released from all unaccrued obligations with respect to
Facility B Commitments under this Agreement.
              (c) The Administrative Agent shall notify each Facility B Bank of
its receipt of a Facility B Extension Notice within two Business Days after the
Administrative Agent's receipt thereof.  The Borrower may deliver only one
Facility B Extension Notice per year.
              (d) Each Facility B Withdrawing Bank shall be obliged, at the
request of the Borrower and subject to the Facility B Withdrawing Bank
receiving payment in full of all amounts owing to it under this Agreement prior
to completion of an assignment, to assign, without recourse or warranty and by
an assignment agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit J attached hereto,
and in accordance with Section 13.3, all of its rights and obligations
hereunder to another financial institution which is an Eligible Assignee
nominated by the Borrower and willing to participate in the facility in the
place of such Facility B Withdrawing Bank; provided that such transferee
satisfies all the requirements of this Agreement.
              (e) If the Facility B Termination Date shall have been extended
in respect of Facility B Continuing Banks in accordance with this Section 2.7,
any Ratable Borrowing Notice or Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect
to any Facility B Loans or Facility B Advances specifying a Borrowing Date or
Conversion/Continuation Date occurring after the Facility B Termination Date
applicable to a Facility B Withdrawing Bank or requesting an Interest Period
extending beyond such date (i) shall have no effect in respect of such
Facility B Withdrawing Bank, and (ii) shall not specify a requested aggregate
principal amount exceeding, when combined with all then outstanding Facility B
Advances, the Facility B Commitments of the Facility B Continuing Banks.
              (f) If the Facility B Termination Date shall have been extended
in respect of Facility B Continuing Banks in accordance with this Section 2.7,
all references herein to the "Facility B Termination Date" shall, with respect
to all parties hereto other than Facility B Withdrawing Banks, refer to the
Facility B Termination Date as so extended.
       2.8.   Facility B. Term Loans.
       2.8.1. Advances.  In the event that the Borrower elects not to extend
the Facility B Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.7, each Facility B Bank
severally agrees on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement to
advance to the Borrower (upon request of the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement) on the then applicable Facility B Termination Date an amount up to
the outstanding principal amount of the Facility B Loans made by such
Facility B Bank and outstanding as of the opening of business on such
Facility B Termination Date.  The aggregate of such advances is collectively
called the "Facility B Term Loans" and shall be made by each Facility B Bank in
accordance with its Facility B Pro Rata Share.  The Facility B Term Loans will
mature and are due and payable one year after such Facility B Termination Date
(the "Facility B Term Loan Maturity Date").  Amounts borrowed under this
Section 2.8 and subsequently repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.
                                   33
<PAGE>

       2.8.2. Notice.  The Facility B Term Loans shall be made upon the
irrevocable written notice (including notice via facsimile confirmed
immediately by a telephone call) of the Borrower in the form of a Facility B
Term Loan Borrowing Notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 8:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) not less than three
Business Days prior to the Facility B Termination Date), specifying: (A) the
amount of the Facility B Term Loans which shall be in an aggregate principal
amount not more than the aggregate principal amount of the Facility B Loans
which will be outstanding as of the opening of business on the Facility B
Termination Date; (B) the Rate Option selected for such Facility B Term Loans;
and (C) the Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loans included in
such notice.

       2.8.3. Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the Facility B Term Loans will
first be used to pay the principal amount of the Facility B Loans which are
outstanding at the time the Facility B Term Loans are made and then in
accordance with Section 6.2.
                                  ARTICLE III
                         TAXES, CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
       3.1.   Taxes.
              (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to each Bank or the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes.
In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay all Other Taxes.
               (b) If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, then:
                   (i)    the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that,
       after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
       deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under
       this Section), such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
       be, receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have
       received and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been made;

                   (ii)   the Borrower shall make such deductions and
       withholdings;

                   (iii)  the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or
       withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable Law; and

                    (iv)  the Borrower shall also pay to each Bank or the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, at the time interest is
paid, Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank specifies as
necessary to preserve the after-tax yield

                                      34
<PAGE>

the Bank would have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had
not been imposed.
              (c)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Bank
and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of (i) Taxes, (ii) Other
Taxes, and (iii) Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank specifies
as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would have received if
such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed, and any
liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other
Taxes or Further Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.  Payment under this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Bank or the
Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.
               (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower
of Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to each Bank
or the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to such
Bank or the Administrative Agent.
       3.2. Yield Protection. If, after the date hereof, because of the
enactment of, or any change in, any Law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or
not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof (other than such
enactments or changes that are not effective as of August 31, 2000 but are
scheduled to become effective thereafter pursuant to such laws, rules,
regulations, policies, guidelines, directives or interpretations that are
effective as of August 31, 2000), which
            (a) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank
(other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the
interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate Advances), or
            (b) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
the cost to any Bank of making, funding or maintaining loans or reduces any
amount receivable by any Bank in connection with loans, or requires any Bank to
make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of loans held or
interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Bank, or
             (c) affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling any Bank and such Bank
determines the amount of capital required is increased by or based upon the
existence of this Agreement or its obligation to make Loans hereunder or of
commitments of this type,
Then, within 15 days of demand by such Bank through the Administrative Agent,
the Borrower shall pay such Bank that portion of such increased expense
incurred (including, in the case of Section 3.2(c), any reduction in the rate
of return on capital to an amount below that which it could have achieved but
for such law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive and after taking
into account such Bank's policies as to capital adequacy) or reduction in an
amount received which such Bank determines is attributable to making, funding
                                   35

and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Bank fails to make a claim within 90 days after it becomes, or ought
reasonably to have become, aware of any event giving rise to a claim under this
Section 3.2, then such Bank shall be entitled to make any claim under this
Section 3.2 only in respect of any amounts due under this Section 3.2 that are
attributable to the period following the 90th day preceding the day upon which
the Bank makes such claim.

       3.3. Availability of Rate Options. If any Bank determines that
maintenance of any of its Fixed Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Office would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent and
the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Rate
Option and require any Fixed Rate Advances outstanding under the affected Rate
Option to be repaid; or if any Bank determines that (i) deposits of a type or
maturity appropriate to match fund Fixed Rate Advances are not available, the
Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Rate Option
with respect to any Fixed Rate Advances made after the date of any such
determination, or (ii) a Rate Option does not accurately reflect the cost of
making a Fixed Rate Advance at such Rate Option, such Bank shall so notify the
Administrative Agent and then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the
availability of the affected Rate Option with respect to any Fixed Rate
Advances made after the date of any such determination.
       3.4. Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment, automatic conversion or otherwise,
or the Borrower requests a Fixed Rate Advance, or the continuation or
conversion of an Advance as or to a Fixed Rate Advance, and the Borrower does
not borrow, continue or convert such Fixed Rate Advance on the date specified
by the Borrower except by reason of default by the Applicable Banks, the
Borrower will indemnify each Applicable Bank for any loss or cost incurred by
it resulting therefrom, including any loss or cost in liquidating or employing
deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Fixed Rate Advance.
       3.5. Regulation D Compensation. Each Applicable Bank may through the
Administrative Agent request the Borrower to pay and upon such request the
Borrower shall pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the
Borrower's Eurodollar Ratable Loans, additional interest on such Loans at a
rate per annum determined by such Bank up to but not exceeding the excess of
(i) (A) the Eurodollar Base Rate divided by (B) one minus the Reserve
Requirement with respect to Eurodollar liabilities over (ii) the Eurodollar
Base Rate.  Any Applicable Bank wishing to require payment of such additional
interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in
which case such additional interest on the Eurodollar Ratable Loans of such
Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the place indicated in such notice with
respect to each Interest Period commencing at least five Business Days after
the giving of such notice, and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five
Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Eurodollar
Ratable Loans of the amount then due it under this Section.
       2.6. Bank Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Bank shall designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to
its Fixed Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Bank under
                                    36
<PAGE>

Section 3.1 or 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability of a Rate Option under
Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not prohibited by applicable legal
and regulatory restrictions and not disadvantageous to such Bank as determined
in its sole discretion.  Each Bank shall deliver to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent a written statement of such Bank as to the amount due, if
any, under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4, simultaneously with making a request for
payment under said Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4.  Such written statement shall set
forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Bank determined
such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the
absence of manifest error.  Determination of amounts payable under such
Sections in connection with a Fixed Rate Loan shall be calculated as though
each Bank funded its Fixed Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the
type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in
determining the Fixed Rate for such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or
not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
statement shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of the
written statement.  The Obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and
3.4 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
       3.7. Removal of Banks. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or
continue any Loans as, or convert Loans to, Eurodollar Ratable Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 3.3, or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
under Section 3.1 or 3.2, the Borrower may elect to terminate this Agreement as
to such Bank, provided that (i) the Borrower notifies such Bank through the
Administrative Agent of such election at least five Business Days before any
date fixed for a borrowing, (ii) the Borrower repays all of such Bank's
outstanding Obligations at the end of the respective Interest Periods
applicable thereto and (iii) no Default or Unmatured Default exists.  Upon
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the Commitment of such Bank
shall terminate.

             (f) One copy of the Articles of Incorporation (or comparable

            (a) There exists no Default or Unmatured Default.
            (b) The representations and warranties contained in Article V are
true and correct as of such Borrowing Date except for changes in the Schedules
hereto reflecting transactions permitted by this Agreement.
       Each Ratable Borrowing Notice or Competitive Bid Quote Request with
respect to each such Advance shall constitute a representation and warranty by
the Borrower that the conditions contained in Sections 4.2(a) and (b) have been
satisfied.

                                  ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Banks that:
       5.1. Corporate Existence. The Borrower is a corporation duly
incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon and is
duly qualified and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
       5.2. Authorization and Validity.  The Borrower has the corporate power
and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to
perform its Obligations thereunder.  The execution and delivery by the Borrower
of the Loan Documents and the performance of its Obligations thereunder have
been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents
constitute legal, valid and binding Obligations of the Borrower enforceable
against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.
       5.3. No Conflict; Government Consent.  Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any Law, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's
articles of incorporation or bylaws or the provisions of any indenture,
instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or
is subject, or by which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien in, of or on the property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the
terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement.  No order, consent,
approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, any Governmental Authority, or any
subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is required in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of, or the legality, validity,
binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents.
       5.4. Financial Statements.  The August 31, 2000 consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the
Banks were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present the
consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations for
the period then ended.
       5.5. Material Adverse Change. Since May 31, 2000, there has been no
change in the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could have a
Material Adverse Effect.
       5.6. Taxes. The Borrower and the Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns and all other United States and foreign tax returns
which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said
                                   39
<PAGE>

returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and
as to which adequate reserves have been provided.  The United States income tax
returns of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended May 31, 1994.  No tax liens have
been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes.
The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are
adequate.
       5.7. Litigation and Contigent Obligations.  There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of the Borrower's officers, threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary which might materially adversely
affect the business, properties, financial condition prospects, or results of
operations of the Borrower or the ability of the Borrower to perform its
Obligations under the Loan Documents.  The Borrower has no material contingent
obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred
to in Section 5.4.
       5.8. Subsidiaries. Schedule 1 hereto contains an accurate list of all of
the presently existing Subsidiaries of the Borrower, setting forth their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation and the percentage of their
respective capital stock owned by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Date.  All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
such Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable.  Each Subsidiary is duly organized or formed and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
and is duly qualified and has all requisite power and authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
       5.9. ERISA. There are no material Unfunded Liabilities.  Each Plan
complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of Law and
regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan, neither
the Borrower nor any other members of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from
any Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to terminate
any Plan.
      5.10. Accuracy of Information.  No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Administrative Agent or to
any Bank in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan
Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a
material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein
not misleading.
      5.11. Regulation U.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary owns any
margin stock (as defined in Regulation U).
      5.12. Material Agreements.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which might have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in (i)
any agreement to which it is a party, which default might have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing
Indebtedness.
                                40
<PAGE>

      5.13. Compliance With Laws.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective properties where failure to
comply might have a Material Adverse Effect.
      5.14. Ownership of Properties.  Except as set forth on Schedule 2 hereto,
on the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will have good
title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15, to all of
the properties and assets reflected in the financial statements as owned by
them.
      5.15. Post-Retirement Benefits.  The amount of the present value of the
expected cost of post-retirement medical and insurance benefits payable by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries to their employees and former employees, as
estimated by the Borrower in accordance with reasonable procedures and
assumptions, is not material to the financial condition of the Borrower.
      5.16. Environmental and Safety and Health Matters.  To the best of the
knowledge of the Borrower, the Borrower and each Subsidiary are in compliance
with all Environmental Laws and Occupational and Health Laws where failure to
comply would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder.  Neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received notice of any claims that any of them
is not in compliance in all material respects with the Environmental Laws where
failure to comply would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations.

                                ARTICLE VI
                                COVENANTS
       During the term of this Agreement, unless the Majority Facility A Banks
and the Majority Facility B Banks (if the Facility B Commitments are in effect
or any Facility B Loans are outstanding) shall otherwise consent in writing:
       6.1. Financial Reporting.  The Borrower will maintain, for itself and
each Material Subsidiary, a system of accounting established and administered
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and furnish to the
Administrative Agent with sufficient copies for each Bank:
            (a) Within 120 days after the close of each of its fiscal years,
an unqualified audit report certified by independent certified public
accountants, acceptable to the Banks, prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles on a consolidated basis for itself and the
Subsidiaries, including balance sheets as of the end of such period, related
profit and loss and reconciliation of surplus statements, and a statement of
cash flows.
            (b) Within 60 days after the close of each of the first three
quarterly periods of each of its fiscal years, for itself and the
Subsidiaries, a consolidated unaudited balance sheet as at the close of such
period, and a
                                      41
<PAGE>

consolidated profit and loss statement and a consolidated statement of cash
flows for the period from the beginning of such fiscal year to the end of such
quarter, all certified by its chief financial officer.
            (c) Together with the financial statements required hereunder, a
compliance certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit I hereto signed by
its chief financial officer showing the calculations necessary to determine
compliance with this Agreement and stating that no Default or Unmatured Default
exists or, if any Default or Unmatured Default exists, stating the nature and
status thereof.
            (d) Promptly upon the furnishing thereof to the shareholders of
the Borrower, copies of all financial statements, reports and proxy statements
so furnished.

            (e) Promptly upon the filing thereof, copies of all S-1's, 10-Ks
and 10-Qs (and any substitute which may hereafter be required) which the
Borrower or any Material Subsidiary files with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
            (f) Such other information (including non-financial information)
as the Administrative Agent or any Bank may from time to time reasonably
request.
       6.2. Use of Proceeds.  The Borrower will, and the Borrower will cause
each Subsidiary to, use the proceeds of the Advances for working capital
purposes and general corporate purposes; provided that the proceeds of the
Advances shall not be used for the direct financing of an Unfriendly
Acquisition, a bid to make an Unfriendly Acquisition or any steps preliminary
to an Unfriendly Acquisition or a bid to make an Unfriendly Acquisition.  The
Borrower will not, nor will the Borrower permit any Subsidiary to, use any of
the proceeds of the Loans to purchase or carry any "margin stock" (as defined
in Regulations U and X) or to extend credit to any person to purchase or carry
any margin stock, or extend credit to any person for any of the aforesaid
purposes.
       6.3. Notice of Default.  The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give prompt notice in writing to the Administrative Agent and
Banks of (i) the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default, (ii) any
other development, financial, legal or otherwise, which the Borrower
reasonably expects will have a Material Adverse Effect or would materially
adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to repay the Obligations, and
(iii) receipt of any notice that the operations of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary are not in compliance with requirements of any applicable
Environmental Law or any Occupational Safety and Health Law where failure to
comply would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations hereunder, or receipt of
notice that any properties or assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary are
subject to an Environmental Lien securing obligations in excess of
$20,000,000. As used herein, "Environmental Lien" means a Lien in favor of any
Governmental Authority for (i) any liability under any Environmental Law, or
(ii) damages arising from or costs incurred by such Governmental Authority in
response to a spillage, disposal or release into the environment of any
hazardous or toxic substance.
                                    42

duly incorporated and validly existing as a corporation in its jurisdiction of
incorporation and maintain all requisite authority to conduct its business in
each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted; provided that the
Borrower may liquidate or dissolve any Subsidiary into the Borrower or any
other Subsidiary, provided, however, that a Material Subsidiary may not
liquidate or dissolve into a Subsidiary that is not a Material Subsidiary.
The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, engage in any
material line of business substantially different from those lines of business
carried on by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof or such
other lines of business as are reasonably related thereto.
       6.5 Taxes.  The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, pay
when due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or
its income, profits or property, except those which are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which adequate
reserves have been set aside.

       6.6 Insurance.  The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance,

Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon any Bank's request
full information as to the insurance carried.
       6.7. Compliance with Laws.  The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs,
judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject.
       6.8. Maintenance of Properties; Trademarks and Franchises.  The
Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, do all things necessary to
maintain, preserve, protect and keep its properties in good repair, working
order and condition, and make all necessary and proper repairs, renewals and
replacements so that its business carried on in connection therewith may be
properly conducted at all times.  The Borrower and each Subsidiary own, are
licensed or otherwise have the lawful right to use, and will continue to own,
be licensed or have the lawful right to use, all permits and other
governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights,
technology, know-how and processes used in or necessary for the conduct of
their businesses as currently conducted.  The use of such permits and other
governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights,
technology, know-how and processes by the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person.
       6.9. Inspection.  Subject to Section 10.12 hereof, the Borrower will,
and will cause each Subsidiary to, permit the Administrative Agent or any
Bank, by their respective representatives and agents, to inspect any of the
properties, corporate books and financial records of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary, to examine and make copies of the books of accounts and other
financial records of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, and to discuss the
affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with, and
to be advised as to the same by, their respective officers at such reasonable
times and intervals as the Administrative Agent or any Bank may designate.

giving effect thereto, the Borrower or any Subsidiary is in violation of any
of the provisions hereof.
       6.11. Merger.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Material
Subsidiary to, merge or consolidate with or into any other Person, except that

another Material Subsidiary, provided, that in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Borrower, the Borrower is the surviving entity,
and (b) the Borrower or a Material Subsidiary may merge or consolidate with
any other Person to effect an Acquisition permitted by Section 6.14, provided,
that the Borrower or such Material Subsidiary, as applicable, is the surviving
entity.

       6.12. Sale of Assets.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any
Subsidiary to, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of its property,
assets or business to any other Person except (i) sales of inventory in the
ordinary course of business, and (ii) any other disposals of assets (including
sale and leasebacks but excluding the sale and leaseback of the Borrower's

twelve consecutive months, commencing on or after the date hereof, does not
exceed 20% of the aggregate book value of the assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ("Substantial Portion"), as of the end of the
fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of calculation.

       6.13. Sale and Leaseback.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit
any Subsidiary to, sell or transfer any property in order to concurrently or
subsequently lease as lessee such or similar property except with respect to
sales of property or sale and leaseback transactions which would be permitted
by Section 6.12.
       6.14. Acquisitions.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any
Subsidiary to, make any Acquisition if the Acquisition is of a Person engaged
in businesses not permitted by Section 6.4.
       6.15 Liens.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, create, incur, or suffer to exist any Lien in, of or on the property of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, except:
            (a) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies

any material way affect the marketability of the same or interfere with the
use thereof in the business of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries.

             (f) Liens incurred in connection with the purchase by the

             (g) Liens incurred in connection with the acquisition of real

taken by such Rating Agency.

                                ARTICLE VIII
                    ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES
       8.1. Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.5, 7.6 or 7.7
occurs, the obligations of the Banks to make Loans to the Borrower hereunder
shall automatically terminate and the Obligations of the Borrower shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part
of the Administrative Agent or any Bank.  If any other Default occurs, (a) the
Majority Facility A Banks may terminate or suspend the obligations of the
Facility A Banks to make Facility A Loans to the Borrower hereunder, or declare
the Facility A Obligations of the Borrower to be due and payable, or both, and
(b) the Majority Facility B Banks may terminate or suspend the obligations of
the Facility B Banks to make Facility B Loans to the Borrower hereunder, or
declare the Facility B Obligations of the Borrower to be due and payable, or
both, whereupon such Facility A Obligations or such Facility B Obligations, as
the case may be, shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby
expressly waives.
       If, within 14 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Facility A
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Facility A Banks to make
Facility A Loans hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default
as described in Section 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 or 7.10) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Facility A Obligations due shall have been
obtained or entered, the Majority Facility A Banks (in their sole discretion)
shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower,
rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.
       If, within 14 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Facility B
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Facility B Banks to make
Facility B Loans hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default
as described in Section 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 or 7.10) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Facility B Obligations due shall have been
obtained or entered, the Majority Facility B Banks (in their sole discretion)
shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower,
rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.
       8.2. Amendments and Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement, and no consent with respect to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and (A)
signed by (i) the Majority Facility A Banks (or by the Administrative Agent at
the written request of the Majority Facility A Banks) if such waiver, amendment
or consent affects the Facility A Banks, (ii) the Majority Facility B Banks (or
                                     48
<PAGE>
by the Administrative Agent at the written request of the Majority Facility B
Banks) if such waiver, amendment or consent affects the Facility B Banks, and
(iii) the Borrower, and (B) acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and then
any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such
waiver, amendment or consent shall, without the consent of each Applicable Bank
affected thereby, do any of the following:
              (a) Extend the scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note or reduce
the principal amount thereof (other than as permitted by this Agreement), or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon.
              (b) Reduce the percentage specified in the definitions of
Majority Banks, Majority Facility A Banks, or Majority Facility B Banks.
              (c) Subject to Sections 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8, extend the Facility A
Termination Date or the Facility B Termination Date, increase the amount of the
Commitment of any Bank hereunder, or permit the Borrower to assign its rights
under this Agreement.
              (d) Amend or waive the provisions of Article IV.
              (e) Amend this Section 8.2.
       No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the
Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the
Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee
required under Section 10.7(a) or 13.3.3 without obtaining the consent of any
of the Banks.
       8.3. Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Banks or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an
acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of
a Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent
to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or
partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other
variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents
whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Banks and the
Administrative Agent required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the
extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies contained in the
Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to (a) the Administrative Agent until the Obligations have been paid
in full, (b) the Facility A Banks until the Facility A Obligations have been
paid in full, and (c) the Facility B Banks until the Facility B Obligations
have been paid in full.

                            GENERAL PROVISIONS
      10.1. Survival of Representations.  All representations and warranties
made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive
the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and
warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and
each Bank, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or
any Bank or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent
or any Bank may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Unmatured
Default at the time of any Loan or Commitment, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation shall remain unpaid or
unsatisfied.

      10.2. Governmental Regulation.  Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, no Bank shall be obligated to extend credit to
the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.
      10.3. Taxes.  Any taxes (excluding income taxes) or other similar
assessments or charges payable or ruled payable by any Governmental Authority
in respect of the Loan Documents shall be paid by the Borrower, together with
interest and penalties, if any.
      10.4. Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any
of the provisions of the Loan Documents.
      10.5. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, on such subject matter.  In the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
                                  50
<PAGE>
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the
Banks in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement.  Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

      10.6. Several Obligations.  The respective obligations of the Banks
hereunder are several and not joint and no Bank shall be the partner or agent
of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is
authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Bank to perform any of its
obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer
any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and assigns.
      10.7. Expenses; Indemnification.
            (a)  The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for the
costs and expenses incurred in the preparation, execution and administration of
the Loan Documents as set forth in a letter agreement between the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower dated October 5, 2000.
            (b)  The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and each
Bank for all itemized, reasonable costs and expenses (including attorney's fees
and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent and each Bank, which
attorneys may be employees of a Bank) (hereinafter, collectively, "Attorney
Costs") paid or incurred in connection with the collection and enforcement of
the Loan Documents during the existence of a Default or after acceleration of
the Advances (including in connection with any "workout" or restructuring
regarding the Advances, and including in any insolvency proceeding).  The
Borrower further agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Co-Arrangers
and each Bank, and each of their respective directors, officers and employees
against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
expenses (including all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether
or not the Administrative Agent or any Bank is a party thereto, including
Attorney Costs) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated
hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the
proceeds of any Loan hereunder (together, "Indemnified Liabilities"), subject
to Oregon Revised Statutes (section mark) 20.096.  The Obligations of the
Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
      10.8. Numbers of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to
each of the Applicable Banks.

accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.  The Borrower will not make any change in its fiscal year or in the
accounting principles and methods used in preparing its financial statements.
                                     51
<PAGE>
      10.10. Severability of Provisions.  Any provision of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
      10.11. Nonliability of Banks.  The relationship between the Borrower and
the Banks and the Administrative Agent with respect to this Agreement shall be
solely that of borrower and lender.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Bank shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower with respect to
this Agreement.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank undertakes under
this Agreement any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business
or operations.
      10.12. Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
and not disclose the Information to any Person who is not an officer or
employee of the Administrative Agent or the Banks (or counsel to them) involved
with the lending facilities contemplated by this Agreement; except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors,
officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other
advisors who are involved with the lending facilities contemplated by this
Agreement (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made
will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed
to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority; (c) to the extent  required by applicable Laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party
to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible

such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional
advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the
Borrower; (g) with the consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach
of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any
Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i)
to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to
information about a Bank's or its Affiliates' investment portfolio in
connection with ratings issued with respect to such Bank or its Affiliates.
For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received
from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in
the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery as
confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
                                     52
<PAGE>
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.  The obligations under this Section
10.12 shall survive for two years following (a) the termination of this
Agreement, or (b) with respect to a Withdrawing Bank, when such Withdrawing
Bank withdraws.
      10.13. CHOICE OF LAW.  THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF OREGON BUT
GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.
      10.14. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS
TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR OREGON STATE
COURT SITTING IN PORTLAND, OREGON IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT
ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY BANK TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
      10.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND
EACH BANK HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

                                ARTICLE XI
                          THE ADMINISTRATION AGENT
       11.1. Appointment and Authorization; "Administrative Agent"  TC  .  Each
Bank hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 11.9) appoints, designates and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein and therein, nor shall the Administrative
Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this
Agreement with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote
any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable Law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter
of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.
       11.2. Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of
its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible to any Bank for the negligence or misconduct of
any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.
       11.3. Liability of Administrative Agent.  No Administrative
Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set
forth herein or therein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Bank or
participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer
thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other party to any Loan
Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Administrative
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or
to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements
contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.
       11.4. Reliance by Administrative Agent.
                                 54
             (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Majority Banks, the Majority Facility A Banks or the
Majority Facility B Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.  The Administrative Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of
the Majority Banks, the Majority Facility A Banks or the Majority Facility B
Banks, as applicable, or all the Banks, if required hereunder, and such request
and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon
all of the Banks and participants.  Where this Agreement expressly permits or
prohibits an action unless the Majority Banks, the Majority Facility A Banks or
the Majority Facility B Banks otherwise determine, the Administrative Agent
shall, and in all other instances, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not
be required to, initiate any solicitation for the consent or a vote of the
Banks.
             (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.1, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Bank
for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Bank.
       11.5. Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured
Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest
and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Applicable Banks, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written
notice from a Bank or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default."  The Administrative Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of any
such notice.  The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Unmatured Default as may be requested by the Majority Banks in
accordance with Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent has received any such request, the Administrative Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking
such action, with respect to such Default or Unmatured Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.
       11.6. Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that none of the
Administrative Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to
it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any
consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Administrative Agent-Related Person to any Bank as to any
                                 55
<PAGE>
matter, including whether Administrative Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession.  Each Bank represents to the
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Administrative Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition
and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable
bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to
the Borrower hereunder.  Each Bank also represents that it will, independently
and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative
Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates which
may come into the possession of any of the Administrative Agent-Related
Persons.
       11.7. Indemnification of Administrative Agent.  Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify
upon demand the Administrative Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the obligation
of the Borrower to do so), pro rata, from and against any and all Indemnified
Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for
the payment to any Administrative Agent-Related Person of any portion of such
Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or
willful misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with
the directions of the Majority Banks, the Majority Facility A Banks or the
Majority Facility B Banks shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or
willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for
its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney
Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any
other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to
the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by
or on behalf of the Borrower.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Commitments, the payment of all Obligations hereunder and
the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
       11.8. Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity.  Bank of America and
its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
the Borrower and its Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the
                                  56
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks.
The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its
Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of the Borrower or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the
Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information
to them.  With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank," "Banks,"
"Applicable Bank" and "Applicable Banks" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.
       11.9. Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may, and
at the request of the Majority Banks shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon
30 days' notice to the Banks.  If the Administrative Agent resigns under this
Agreement, the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor
agent for the Banks.  If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective
date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Borrower, a successor
agent from among the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and
Section 10.7 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  If no
successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Banks
appoint a successor agent as provided for above.
      11.10. Foreign Banks.  Each Bank that is a "foreign corporation,
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding
under the Code (or after accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two
duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
(relating to such Person and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction
of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto
(relating to all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent that such Person is entitled to an exemption from, or
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax.  Thereafter and from time to time, each
such Person shall (a) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such
additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such
successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United
States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United
States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or
reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be
                                 57
<PAGE>
made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (b) promptly
notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would
modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (c) take such
steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable
judgment of such Bank, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-
designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws
that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts
payable to such Person.  If such Person fails to deliver the above forms or
other documentation, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable
withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without
reduction.  If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent
did not properly withhold any tax or other amount from payments made in respect
of such Person, such Person shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor,
including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs
and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent.  The
obligations of the Banks under this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
      11.11. Other Agents; Co-Lead Arrangers.  None of the Persons identified
in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Co-Documentation Agent" or "Co-
Arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or
duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks as such.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Persons so identified shall have or
be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank.  Each Bank
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Persons
so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not
taking action hereunder.
                                ARTICLE XII
                          SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS
       12.1. Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any
Default or Unmatured Default occurs and is continuing, each Bank is authorized
at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, any
such notice being waived by the Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at
any time owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank, now or hereafter
existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Bank
shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Bank agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such
set-off and application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.
      12.2. Ratable Payments.  If any Bank, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
payment made to it upon its Loans in a greater proportion than that received by
any other Bank (except as specifically contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement), such Bank agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Facility A Loans or Facility B Loans, as the case may be, held by the other
Applicable Banks so that after such purchase each Applicable Bank will hold its
                                   58
<PAGE>
ratable proportion of Facility A Loans or Facility B Loans, as the case may be.
If any Bank, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be
subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its
Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to set off, such Bank agrees,
promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Banks share
in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In
case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate
further adjustments shall be made.  Nothing in this Section shall impair the
right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have
and apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of
the Borrower other than the Obligations.
                                ARTICLE XIII
               BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

       13.1. Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Banks and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or Obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Bank (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and any
assignment by any Bank must be made in compliance with Section 13.3.  The
Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for
all purposes hereof unless and until such payee complies with Section 13.3 in
the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a
written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative Agent.  Any
assignee or transferee of a Note agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by
all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or
consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or
Notes issued in exchange therefor.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the
extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Administrative Agent-Related Persons)
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.

       13.2. Participations.
       13.2.1. Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Bank may, in the ordinary
course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable
law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other financial institutions
("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any
Note held by such Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or any other interest of
such Bank under the Loan Documents.  Participations in Competitive Bid Loans
may be sold to any entity.  In the event of any such sale by a Bank of
participating interests to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under the
Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under
this Agreement shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such
participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall
                                59
<PAGE>
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such
Bank's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
      13.2.2. Voting Rights.  Each Bank shall retain the sole right to approve,
without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification
or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has
an interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest
rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, postpones any
date fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or
fees on, any such Loan or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan
or releases any substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such
Loan.
      13.2.3. Benefit of Setoff.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 12.1 in respect
of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the
same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly
to it as a Bank under the Loan Documents, provided that each Bank shall retain
the right of setoff provided in Section 12.1 with respect to the amount of
participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Banks agree to share
with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
provided in Section 12.1, agrees to share with each Bank, any amount received
pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in
accordance with Section 12.2 as if each Participant were a Bank.
       13.3. Assignments.
       13.3.1. Permitted Assignments by Facility A Banks.  Any Facility A Bank
may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business, in accordance
with applicable law, with the prior consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and
provided that no such consent shall be necessary in connection with assignments
to Purchasers that are Affiliates of such Bank and provided further that no
consent of the Borrower shall be required if there exists a Default), at any
time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees ("Purchasers") all or any part of
its rights and obligations as a Facility A Bank and all or any part of its
Facility A Obligations, ratably, under the Loan Documents, provided that each
assignment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and in
increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the remaining amount
of Facility A Commitment and Facility A Loans held by the assignor) and further
provided, that assignments of Competitive Facility A Bid Loans may be made to
any entity on a ratable or non-ratable basis.  Such assignment shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit J hereto or such other form based on the
LSTA model as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  Such
consent shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 2 to Exhibit J
hereto.
       13.3.2. Permitted Assignments by Facility B Banks.  Any Facility B Bank
may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business, in accordance
with applicable law, with the prior consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and
provided that no such consent shall be necessary in connection with assignments
to Purchaser that are Affiliates of such Bank and provided further that no
consent of the Borrower shall be required if there exists a Default), at any
                               60
<PAGE>
time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees ("Purchasers") all or any part of
its rights and obligations as a Facility B Bank and all or any part of its
Facility B Obligations, ratably, under the Loan Documents, provided that each
assignment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and in
increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the remaining amount
of Facility B Commitment and Facility B Loans held by the assignor) and further
provided, that assignments of Competitive Facility B Bid Loans may be made to
any entity on a ratable or non-ratable basis.  Such assignment shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit J hereto or such other form based on the
LSTA model as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  Such
consent shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 2 to Exhibit J
hereto.
      13.3.3. Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative
Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit
1 to Exhibit J hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents
required by Section 13.3.1 or Section 13.3.2, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee
to the Administrative Agent from the assignor for processing such assignment,
such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such
Notice of Assignment.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such
Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Bank party to this Agreement and any
other Loan Document executed by the Banks and shall have all the rights and
Obligations of a Bank under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it
were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by the
Borrower, the Banks or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release
the transferor Bank with respect to the percentage of the Commitments and Loans
assigned to such Purchaser.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 13.3.3, the transferor Bank, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so
that replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Bank and new Notes or, as
appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in
principal amounts reflecting their Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such
assignment.
      13.3.4. Federal Reserve Banks.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any Bank may at any time create a security
interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interests in
this Agreement (and the Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank
in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR (section mark)203.14, and may
assign all or any portion of its rights under or interests in this Agreement
(and the Notes held by it) to any Affiliate for purposes of creating such a
security interest or pledge, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such
security interest or pledge in any manner permitted under applicable law.

November 17, 2000

To the Administrative Agent and Banks who are parties to the
Credit Agreement described below:

Re:    Opinion of Counsel

Ladies and Gentlemen:

       I serve as General Counsel of NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the
"Borrower").  In that capacity, I provide this Opinion Letter in connection
with the Credit Agreement dated as of November 17, 2000 among the Borrower,
Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the Banks named therein,
providing for loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding
$1,250,000,000 at any one time outstanding, and the Ratable Notes, Competitive
Facility A Bid Notes, and Competitive Facility B Bid Notes executed in
connection therewith (collectively, the "Agreement").  Capitalized terms used
in this Opinion Letter are defined as set forth in the Agreement or the Accord
(see below).

       This Opinion Letter is governed by, and shall be interpreted in
accordance with, the Legal Opinion Accord (the "Accord") of the ABA Section of
Business Law (1991).  As a consequence, it is subject to a number of
qualifications, exceptions, definitions, limitations on coverage and other
limitations, all as more particularly described in the Accord, and this Opinion
Letter should be read in conjunction therewith.  The Law covered by the
opinions expressed herein is limited to the Federal Laws of the United States
and the Law of the State of Oregon.  This Opinion Letter is limited to matters
about which I possess Actual Knowledge.

       Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

       1.     The Agreement is enforceable against the Borrower.

       2.     Execution and delivery by the Borrower of, and performance of its
agreements in, the Agreement do not (i) violate its Constituent Documents, (ii)
breach or result in a default under any existing obligation of the Borrower, or
result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien, under any contract
filed by the Borrower with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or
(iii) breach or otherwise violate any existing obligation of the Borrower under
any Court Order.

       3.     Execution and delivery by the Borrower of, and performance by the
Borrower of its agreements in, the Agreement do not violate applicable
provisions of statutory law or regulation.

                                      F-1
<PAGE>

       4.    There are no actions or proceedings against the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, pending, or overtly threatened in writing, before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator which (a) seek to affect the enforceability
of the Agreement, or (b) would would result in a material adverse effect on the
business or financial condition of the Borrower.

       The General Qualifications apply to the opinions set forth in paragraphs
1 and 3 above and the Other Common Qualifications apply to all of the opinions
set forth above.  This Opinion Letter may be relied upon only by you and your
assignees and the Banks in connection with the Transaction and may not, without
our prior written consent, be used or relied upon by you or any other person
for any purpose whatsoever, except to the extent authorized in the Accord.

                                 Very truly yours,



                                 James C. Carter

liable for any mistake, error of judgment, or action taken or omitted to be
taken in connection with the Loans or the Loan Documents, except for its or
their own bad faith or willful misconduct.
       6.     INDEMNITY. The Assignee agrees to indemnify and hold the Assignor
harmless against any and all losses, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and liabilities incurred by the
Assignor in connection with or arising in any manner from the Assignee's

shall have the right pursuant to Section 13.3 of the Credit Agreement to assign
the rights which are assigned to the Assignee hereunder to any Person, provided
that (i) any such subsequent assignment does not violate any of the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents or any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction or decree and that any consent required under the terms of
the Loan Documents has been obtained, and (ii) the Assignee is not thereby
released from any of its obligations to the Assignor hereunder.
