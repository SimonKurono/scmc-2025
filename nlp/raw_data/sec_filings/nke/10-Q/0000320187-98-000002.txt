         ___________________________________________ 
 
Basis of Presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial 
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations 
for the three (3) and six (6) months ended November 30, 1997 are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 
 
     Net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average 
number of common and common equivalent (stock option) shares outstanding 
for the period(s). 
 
     On October 23, 1996 the Company issued additional shares in connection 
with a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend 
on outstanding Class A and Class B common stock.  The per common share amounts 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been 
adjusted to reflect this stock split.

NOTE 5 - Change in year-end of certain subsidiaries: 
         __________________________________________ 
 
     Prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of the Company's non-U.S.
operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag 
which allowed more time to compile results. Beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.  As a 
result, the May 1996 charge from operations for these entities of 
$4.1 million was recorded to retained earnings in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997. 
 

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 1998 decreased 20% to 
$141.0 million or $0.48 per share compared to $176.9 million or $0.60 
per share last year.  Year to date, net income was $394.2 
million or $1.33 per share compared to $402.9 million or $1.36 per share 
last year, a decrease of two percent.  Revenues increased seven percent 
(14% year to date) over the prior year's second quarter, rising to $2.3 
billion for the quarter from $2.1 billion last year.  Gross margins for 
the quarter were 37.5 percent of sales and 38.8 percent year to date, 
compared to 39.4 percent and 39.9 percent last year, respectively.  
Selling and administrative expenses were 26.3 percent of second quarter 
revenues, compared to 25.2 percent last year, and 24.9 percent year to 
date compared with  24.2percent for the prior year. 
 
Revenues increased $148.2 million for the quarter and $632.4 million 
year-to-date, which represents a seven percent  and 14% increase over 
last year's revenues, respectively.  Non-U.S. brand revenues, which 
represent the majority of the growth, increased 14% for the quarter and 
30% on a year-to-date basis over the prior year.  Had the dollar 
remained constant with that of the prior year, non-U.S. revenues would 
have increased 24% for the quarter and 41% on a year-to -date basis.  
For the quarter, Europe increased five percent (17% on a constant dollar 
basis), Asia Pacific increased 18% (28% on a constant dollar basis), 
with the largest country, Japan, increasing 24% (35% on a constant 
dollar basis), and the Americas (which includes Canada and Latin 
America) increased 40% (42% on a constant dollar basis).  Year 
to date, Europe increased 20% (34% on a constant dollar basis), Asia 
Pacific increased 39% (49% on a constant dollar basis), Japan 
increased 58% (71% on a constant dollar basis), and the Americas 
increased 48% (50% on a constant dollar basis). 
 
Total U.S. brand revenues increased two percent for the quarter and six 
percent year to date compared to the prior year.  U.S. apparel revenues 
increased 12% in the quarter and 17% on a year-to-date basis.  Training, 
the largest apparel category, increased four percent in the quarter.  
The key apparel growth categories of golf, running, outdoor and soccer 
all experienced double-digit increases in the quarter.  U.S. footwear 
revenues were down three percent in the quarter and increased one 
percent on a year-to-date basis.  The primary reason for the decline in 
U. S. footwear revenues for the quarter and relative flat comparison on 
a year-to-date basis is due to the relative slow down in the U.S. retail 
markets as well as the difficult comparison against significant growth 
rates experienced in the prior periods and the resulting increased 
revenue base.  For the quarter, basketball revenues, including the 
Jordan brand, increased nine percent; running, after almost three years 
of double-digit quarterly gains, was down nine percent; training 
declined 15%, while soccer and golf posted increases of 106% and 94%, 
respectively. 
 
Other and Other Brands, which includes NIKE brand equipment, Bauer Inc., 
Cole Haan, Sports Specialties, and Tetra Plastics, increased 13% to 
$158.6 million for the quarter and five percent to $307.0 million year 
to date.  The increase for the quarter and year to date was primarily 
due to NIKE brand equipment increases against a relatively small base 
partially offset by a decline in the Other Brands. 
 
The Company expects total revenue growth for fiscal 1998 to be slightly 
higher than the prior year.  The reduced level of growth 
rates compared with recent years reflects the sluggish U.S. retail 
environment and the significant downturn in the Asian markets, offset by 
growth in Europe and the Americas. 
 
The breakdown of revenues follows:

</TABLE> 

The reduction in gross margins as a percentage of revenues, compared 
with the prior year's second quarter, was primarily attributable to a 
higher percentage of close-out product sales and, to a lesser extent, 
higher levels of research, design and development costs.  The increased 
mix of close-out product sales compared to total sales is a result of 
increased inventory levels from the sudden slow-down in key Asian 
markets, the sluggish U.S. retail environment and European sales 
returning to a more normal level of close-out sales as a percentage of 
total sales.  Management expects the fiscal 1998 gross margin percentage 
to be lower than the prior year, primarily due to higher levels of 
close-out sales and increased sales of lower priced products, higher 
product costs and increased spending on infrastructure to support the 
higher levels of operations. 
 
Selling and administrative expenses increased $62.6 million over the 
previous year's second quarter and $192.0 million year-to-date.  The 
majority of the increase wass attributable to planned increased spending 
to support the long-term growth in the business, including personnel - 
and other infrastructure-related costs and endorsement contracts.  The 
Company continues to invest in long-term growth plans, more 
predominately outside the U.S., and expects that selling and 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will be higher than 
the prior year. 
 
Interest expense increased for both the quarter and year-to-date over 
the prior year due to increased short-term borrowings for growing 
operations, predominately outside the U.S., financing increased 
inventories and receivables.  Other expense increased a net 
$6.5 million for the quarter due to non-recurring income items 
experienced in the prior year, principally a promotional event in Japan 
and conversion gains on foreign transactions. 
 
Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear 
and apparel scheduled for delivery from December 1997 through April 1998 
totaled $4.2 billion, one percent lower than such orders for the same 
period last year. These orders and the percentage change in these orders 
are not necessarily indicative of the change in revenues which the 
Company will experience for subsequent periods.  This is due to 
potential shifts in the mix of advance futures orders in relation to at 
once orders and varying cancellation rates.  Finally exchange rate  
fluctuations will also cause differences in the comparisons.  The 
relative flat rate of growth in futures compared with the same period 
last year is a result of lower than expected orders in the Asian 
markets, most notably Japan, difficult growth comparisons against high 
prior year base levels and the sluggish U.S. retail environment. 
 
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
_______________________________ 
 
The Company's financial position remained strong at November 30, 1997.  
Compared to May 31, 1997, total assets were relatively unchanged at $5.4 
billion while shareholder's equity increased $300 million to $3.5 billion.  
Working capital increased $216 million, to $2.2 billion, and the Company's 
current ratio increased to 2.5 at November 30, 1997 from 2.1 at 1997 
fiscal year-end.  The increase in working capital was due to higher 
inventory levels resulting from the slowdown in the Asian economies and an 
increase in order cancellations coupled with the shift in debt from 
short-term to long-term. 
 
Cash provided by operations was $289 million for the six months ended 
November 30, 1997, an increase of $164 million over last year's first 
six months, primarily due to decreased working capital requirements as a 
result of lower growth rates in the U.S. compared to the first six months 
of fiscal 1997.  
 
Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first six months of 
fiscal 1998 were $242 million.  Additions in the U.S. totaled $102 
million due to continued overall expansion of U.S. operations which included 
warehouse locations, world headquarters expansion, management information 
systems and the continued development of NIKETOWN retail locations.  Outside 
the U.S., additions totaled $131 million and was largely attributable to the 
development and expansion of new and existing warehouse facilities.  In 
addition to the increases in property, plant and equipment, other assets 
increased from May 31, 1997 due, in large part, to advance payments made in 
the first quarter for long-term endorsement contracts. 
 
Additions to long-term debt totaled $101 million for the first six months 
of fiscal 1998.  In fiscal 1997 the Company filed a shelf registration with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of up to $500 million 
of debt securities.  Under this program, the Company issued $100 million 
medium term notes in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, maturing in three 
to five years.  The proceeds were swapped into Dutch Guilders and 
the Company used this long-term fixed rate debt financing, in addition to 
excess cash, to pay down the Company's European short-term debt.  This 
resulted in a net reduction of $311 million in notes payable in the first 
two quarters of fiscal 1998. 
 
Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, together 
with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs.  
Significant short and long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks 
which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity.  
Liquidity is also provided by the Company's commercial paper program under 
which there was $0 outstanding at November 30, 1997. 
 
During the quarter, the Company announced that its Board of Directors 
approved a plan to repurchase a maximum of $1 billion shares of NIKE Class B 
Common Stock over a period of up to four years.  Funding has, and is 
expected to continue to, come from operating cash flow in potential 
combination with short or medium-term borrowings.  The timing and 
the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working capital needs 
and stock market conditions.  As of November 30, 1997, the Company had 
purchased a total of 21.4 million shares for approximately $341.9 million 
in the open market in conjunction with the $450 million share repurchase 
program previously approved in July 1993.  During the second quarter, the 
Company purchased a total of 801,400 shares, for approximately $40.2 million.
 
During the quarter the Company announced a 20% increase in the quarterly cash 
dividend to $.12 per share from the previous $.10 per share.
