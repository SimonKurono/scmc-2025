         ___________________________________________ 
 
Basis of presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial

NOTE 3 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 

SFAS 128, "Earnings per Share," replaces primary and fully diluted 
earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share.  Under the new 
requirements, the dilutive effect of stock options is excluded from the 
calculation of basic earnings per share.  Diluted earnings per share is 
calculated similarly to fully diluted earnings per share as required under 
APB 15.  SFAS 128 became effective for the Company's fiscal 1998 financial 
statements.  All prior period earnings per share data presented have been 
restated to conform to the provisions of this statement.  The following 
represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings 
per share:

NOTE 5 - Restructuring charge:
         _____________________

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 the Company recorded a 
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's 
actions to better align its cost structure with expected revenue growth rates. 
The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular format) primarily related 
to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities company-wide, resulting in 
costs to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease abandonments 
related to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and elimination of, 
certain job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong, 
resulting in reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and other costs of 
downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the Company's 
Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-down of assets no longer in 
use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term endorsement 
contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; and 5) the decision to exit 
certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer subsidiary, resulting in the 
reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the write-down of assets no longer in 
use and the estimated loss on divestiture of certain manufacturing plants.

     No increases to the original estimated restructuring charge were made 
during the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  All activity during the quarter 
related to cash payments to settle severance agreements, lease commitments, 
endorsement contracts and other various items.

     As of August 31, 1998, there were a total of 1,208 employees terminated, 
with 1,135 having left the Company as of that date.


Detail of the restructuring charge is as follows:

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results
_________________

     Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 was $163.8 million, a 
35% decrease compared to the $253.1 million in the prior year's first quarter. 
Results for the first quarter were driven by a 9% decrease in consolidated 
revenues, a gross margin percentage drop of 220 basis points, and selling and 
administrative expenses, that while decreased in terms of absolute dollars, 
increased as a percentage of revenue.  Operations continue to be affected by
the economic crisis in the Asia Pacific region.  In order to better align its 
overall cost structure and organization with planned revenue levels, the 
Company plans on making certain cost cutting measures, including the
elimination of an additional 300 positions throughout its Asia Pacific region in
fiscal 1999. 

     Consolidated revenues for the quarter decreased 9%, or $261.3 million. 
 U.S. brand revenues declined $152.5 million, or 10%, with a 13% decrease in 
footwear and a 5% decrease in apparel revenues.  The $138.6 million decline in 
U.S. footwear revenues was a result of an 11% decrease in pairs sold and a 3% 
reduction in average selling price.  Most core footwear categories showed 
decreases for the quarter, however, Brand Jordan was up 104%, and outdoor was 
up 35%.  U.S. apparel revenues decreased $20.0 million for the quarter.  While 
the core category of basketball was down 20%, men's training and women's 
fitness were up 21% and 61%, respectively.

     Total revenues in Europe were up 12%, or $71.1 million.  Had the dollar 
remained constant, revenues would have increased 9%.  Apparel revenues 
increased 42% over last year, where footwear revenues were down 8%.  France,
Italy, Spain and Germany all had double digit increases in the quarter.

     Revenues in the Asia Pacific region decreased 46%, or $168.4 million.  
Had the dollar remained constant, revenues would have decreased 35%.  Footwear 
and apparel revenues were down 58% and 20%, respectively.  Revenues in Japan 
declined 53% (45% on a constant dollar basis).

     The Americas region, which includes Canada, Mexico and South America, 
decreased 15% compared to last year.  The strengthening of the dollar, 
primarily in Canada, had a significant effect on the quarter, as revenues 
would have decreased 10% on a constant dollar basis.

     Other Brands, which includes Bauer Inc., Cole Haan, Sports Specialties, 
and NIKE IHM (which includes what was formally Tetra Plastics), increased 12% 
to $132.1 million.  The increase was primarily due to Bauer's increase in ice 
hockey sales. 

The breakdown of revenues follows:

     The Company's gross margin percentage for the first quarter was 37.6%, 
down from 39.8% in the prior year.  Margins were adversely affected by 
continued efforts to liquidate the Company's closeout inventories around the 
world, particularly in Asia and in U.S. apparel.  In Europe margins were also 
affected by increased sales of lower priced product and the effect of the 
strengthening US dollar, inhibiting the Company's ability to price product 
competitively. 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% from last year's 
first quarter, but were up as a percentage of revenues, to 26.1% compared to 
23.8%.  While sports marketing expenses increased with significant 
expenditures surrounding the World Cup event in France, wage-related 
expenses were up less than 1% and advertising spending was down, more than 
offsetting the increase in sports marketing expenses.  Selling and 
administrative spending reflects management's continuing efforts to control 
expenditures in a changing industry and general economic environment while not 
jeopardizing long-term growth objectives.  Selling and administrative expenses 
for the full year are expected to be slightly higher than last year's levels 
as a percentage of revenue.

     Interest expense decreased in the first quarter compared to last year 
as less short term debt was needed to finance lower levels of inventories 
and accounts receivable.  Other expense also decreased from the prior 
year, mainly due to less foreign currency transaction losses, offset by 
decreased profit sharing expense and lower interest income.

     The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.5% compared to 
38.5% in the prior year.  The increase in the rate was primarily due to the 
non-deductibility of certain foreign entity losses. 

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear and 
apparel scheduled for delivery from September 1998 through January 1999 
totaled $3.2 billion, 15% lower than such orders for the same period last 
year.  These orders and the percentage change in these orders are not 
necessarily indicative of the change in revenues which the Company will 
experience for subsequent periods.  This is due to potential shifts in the mix 
of advance orders in relation to at once orders and varying cancellation 
rates.  Finally exchange rate fluctuations will also cause differences in the 
comparisons. 

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company recorded a 
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's 
actions to better align its overall cost structure and organization with 
planned revenue levels. The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular 
format) primarily related to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities 
company-wide, resulting in costs to sever employees and related asset write-
downs and lease abandonments related to the affected employees; 2) the 
relocation of, and elimination of, certain job responsibilities of the Asia 
Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong, resulting in reduction in workforce, lease 
abandonments and other costs of downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the 
downsizing of the Company's Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-
down of assets no longer in use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic 
long-term endorsement contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; 
and 5) the decision to exit certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer 
subsidiary, resulting in the reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the 
write-down of assets no longer in use and the estimated loss on divestiture of 
certain manufacturing plants.

     A total of 1,208 employees were terminated due to the above activities, 
1,135 of which have left the Company as of August 31, 1998.

     No increases to the original estimated restructuring charge were made 
during the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  All activity during the quarter 
related to cash payments to settle severance agreements, lease commitments, 
endorsement contracts and other various items.  Future cash outlays are 
anticipated to be completed by the end of this fiscal year, excluding certain 
lease commitments that will continue through July 2001.



Detail of the restructuring charge is as follows:

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative 
instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133).  FAS 133 is effective for all 
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 (June 1, 2000 
for the Company).  This statement will require the Company to recognize all 
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of 
derivatives will be recorded in current earnings or other comprehensive income, 
depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  
The ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current-period 
earnings.  Management of the Company has not yet determined the impact that the 
adoption of FAS 133 will have on the Company's results from operations or its 
financial position.

Year 2000 issue
_______________

	The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs using two digits 
rather than four to define the applicable year.  Such software may recognize a 
date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This could result 
in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the Company's 
activities and operations (the "year 2000" or "Y2K" issue).  If the Company or 
its significant suppliers or customers fail to make necessary modifications, 
conversions, and contingency plans on a timely basis, the year 2000 issue 
could have a material adverse effect on NIKE's business, operations, cash 
flow, and financial condition.  However, the effect cannot be quantified at 
this time because NIKE cannot accurately estimate the magnitude, duration, or 
ultimate impact of noncompliance by suppliers, customers, and third parties 
that have no direct relationship to NIKE.  The Company believes that its 
competitors face a similar risk.  Although not quantifiable, the disclosure 
below is intended to summarize NIKE's actions to minimize that risk.

	In May 1997, the Company established a corporate-wide project team to 
identify non-compliant software and complete the corrections or plans required 
to mitigate the year 2000 issue.  NIKE has identified three categories of 
software and systems that require attention:  

(1)	information technology ("IT") systems, such as mainframes, PCs, 
networks, and production control system, 

(2)	non-IT systems, such as equipment, machinery, climate control, and 
security systems, which may contain microcontrollers with embedded 
technology, and 

(3)	partner (supplier and customer) IT and non-IT systems.  

     The Company intends to fix or replace non-compliant IT and non-IT 
software and systems through the following project phases:

(1)	inventory systems, 

(2) 	assess risks and impact, 

(3)	prioritize projects, 

(4)	fix, replace, or develop contingency plans for non-compliant 
systems, 

(5)	test and on-going quality control, and 

(6)	audit results.  

Currently, NIKE's remediation projects are at different phases of completion.  
Remediation and testing activities are underway on all of the Company's core 
business applications. NIKE engages the services of independent consultants to 
analyze and develop testing standards, quality assurance, and contingency
plans. NIKE's internal auditing department audits the process and remediation
testing, and NIKE's independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, will,
in turn, audit those results. 

	NIKE's assessments have identified 121 major internal I.T. remediation 
projects worldwide.  Forty-three of them have been completed (including 
testing).  NIKE has performed approximately 50 percent of the work believed to 
be required on the remaining projects.  The Company's current target is to 
resolve compliance issues in critical business information systems by December 
31, 1998.  This target date has not changed since NIKE's previous statement on 
the year 2000 issue in its 1998 Form 10-K. 

	The Company is also assessing the compliance of its major customers and 
suppliers.  NIKE has relationships with certain significant suppliers and 
customers in most of the locations in which it operates. The level of 
preparedness of significant suppliers and customers can very greatly from 
country to country.  These relationships are material to many local operations 
and, in the aggregate, are material to the Company.  NIKE relies on suppliers to
timely deliver a broad range of goods and services worldwide, including raw 
materials, footwear, apparel, accessories, equipment, advertising, 
transportation services, banking services, telecommunications and utilities.  
Moreover, NIKE's suppliers rely on countless other suppliers, over which NIKE 
may have little or no influence regarding year 2000 compliance.  NIKE believes 
that suppliers and customers presents  the area of greatest risk to the Company 
in part because of the Company's limited ability to influence actions of third 
parties, and in part because of the Company's inability to estimate the level 
and impact of noncompliance of third parties throughout the extended supply 
chain.

	NIKE is sending surveys to and conducting formal communications with its 
significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which it may be 
affected by those third parties' Y2K preparedness plans.  Some of NIKE's 
significant suppliers and customers have not responded to inquiries from NIKE, 
have refused to respond for liability reasons, or have not responded with 
sufficient detail for NIKE to determine (a) whether the supplier or customer is 
or timely will be Y2K compliant, or (b) if any noncompliance will have a 
material adverse effect on NIKE's business or financial condition.  In the 
absence of adequate responses and disclosures, NIKE is attempting to make 
independent assessments of significant vendors and customers.  However, a 
compliance failure by a major supplier or customer, or one of their suppliers or
customers, could have a material adverse effect on NIKE's business or financial 
condition.  The size of that effect cannot be quantified at this time because of
variables such as the type and importance of the non-responding suppliers and 
customers, the unknown level and duration of noncompliance of suppliers and 
customers (and their suppliers and customers), the possible effect on NIKE's 
operations, and NIKE's ability to respond.  Thus, there can be no assurance that
there will not be a material adverse effect on the Company if third party 
governmental or business entities do not convert or replace their systems in a 
timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the Company's systems. 

	As a result, in some cases NIKE will develop contingency plans that 
assume some estimated level of noncompliance by, or business disruption to, 
suppliers and customers.  The Company intends to have contingency plans 
developed by mid-1999 for significant suppliers and customers determined to be 
at high risk of noncompliance or business disruption.  The contingency plans 
will be developed on a case-by-case basis, and may include booking orders and 
producing products before anticipated business disruptions, manual intervention,
or finding alternative suppliers.  Even so, judgments regarding contingency 
plans - such as how to develop them and to what extent - are themselves subject 
to many variables and uncertainties.  There can be no assurance that NIKE will 
correctly anticipate the level, impact or duration of noncompliance by suppliers
and customers that provide inadequate information, or that its contingency plans
will be sufficient to mitigate the impact.  Thus, some material adverse effect 
to NIKE may result from one or more third parties regardless of defensive 
contingency plans.

	Costs related to the year 2000 issue are funded through operating cash 
flows.  Through the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company expended 
approximately $23 million in remediation efforts, including the cost of new 
software and modifying the applicable code of existing software.  Approximately 
$6.4 million of these expenditures was for new hardware and software, and has 
been capitalized.  The remainder has been expensed as incurred.  The Company 
estimates total costs related to the year 2000 issue will be in the range of
$45 to $50 million, approximately $10 million of which will be capitalized.  The
Company presently believes that the total cost of achieving year 2000 compliant 
systems is not expected to be material to NIKE's financial condition, liquidity,
or results of operations.

	Estimates of time, cost, and risk estimates are based on currently 
available information.  Developments that could affect estimates include, but 
are not limited to, the availability and cost of trained personnel; the ability 
to locate and correct all relevant computer code and systems; cooperation and 
remediation success of the Company's suppliers and customers (and their 
suppliers and customers); and the ability to correctly anticipate risks and 
implement suitable contingency plans in the event of system failures at NIKE or 
its suppliers and customers (and their suppliers and customers).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
     The Company's financial position remained strong at August 31, 1998.  
Compared to May 31, 1998, total assets decreased 2%, or $92.8 million, to 
$5.3 billion.  Shareholder's equity increased $87.5 million, or 2.7%, 
remaining at $3.3 billion.  Working capital increased $47.4 million, to 
$1.9 billion, and the Company's current ratio was 2.22:1 at August 31, 1998 
compared to 2.07:1 at May 31, 1998. 

     Despite lower net income compared with the first quarter of fiscal 1998, 
cash provided by operations increased by $231.5 million to $368.9 million for 
the quarter ended August 31, 1998.  The most significant affect on cash 
provided by operations was the change in the Company's working capital.  At 
August 31, 1998, cash provided by operations was positively affected by changes 
in working capital, primarily the liquidation of inventory since May 31, 1998.
The decreased inventory levels reflect the Company's continued effort to 
reduce overall quantities, particularly closeout product.  Footwear closeout 
levels fell in nearly all regions, which more than offset the slight buildup 
of closeout apparel inventories in the U.S. and Europe.  

     Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first quarter of fiscal
1999 were $85.6 million, split evenly between the U.S. and non-U.S. 
operations, compared to $108.7 million for the first three months of fiscal 
1998.  Additions in the U.S. were comprised primarily of U.S. headquarters 
expansion, customer service distribution facilities, ongoing investment in 
systems infrastructure, and retail expansion. Outside the U.S., the majority 
of the increase related to expansion of the customer service distribution 
center in Europe and retail expansion in all regions. 
 
     Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, 
together with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs. 
Significant short- and long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks 
which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity. 
Liquidity is also provided by the Company's commercial paper program, under 
which there was $0.3 million outstanding at August 31, 1998. 
 
     Dividends per share of common stock for the first quarter of fiscal 1999 
was $.12 per share compared to $.10 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 
1998.

     As of August 31, 1998, the Company has purchased a total of 2.5 million 
shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $105.9 million in the open market 
since the $1 billion share repurchase program was approved in December 
1997.  During the first quarter, the Company purchased a total of 1.3 million 
shares for $52.0 million.  Funding has, and is expected to continue to, come 
from operating cash flow in conjunction with short-term borrowings.  The 
timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working 
capital needs and stock market conditions.

limitation, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic 
instability; changes in government regulations; liability and other claims 
asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and 
other reports.  

     The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this 
report may include additional factors which could adversely impact NIKE's 
business and financial performance.  Moreover, NIKE operates in a very 
competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from 
time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk 
factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's 
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may 
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not 
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual 
results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, 
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE"s policy to disclose 
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial 
information.  Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with 
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of 
the statement or report.  Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or 
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.  Thus, to the 
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, 
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
