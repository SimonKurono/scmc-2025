              NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the nine (9) months ended February 28, 2003 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2003 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
 results of operations or shareholders' equity.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" (FAS 143).  This statement requires that a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized at fair value in
the period the obligation is incurred and the associated retirement costs be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the tangible long-lived asset.
All provisions of this statement will be effective for the Company on June
1, 2003.  It is not expected that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

     In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (FAS 144). This statement
supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (FAS 121), and amends
Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 30, "Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" (APB 30). FAS 144 requires
that long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, that are to
be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value
less costs to sell. FAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions of FAS 121
for (a) recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets
to be held and used and (b) measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed
of by sale. This statement also retains APB 30's requirement that companies
report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations. All
provisions of FAS 144 were effective for the Company on June 1, 2002. The
adoption of FAS 144 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations, and we do not expect any impact
in the foreseeable future.

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (FAS 146).  This statement
supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to
Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)".
FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  Under EITF
94-3, a liability is recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit
plan.  FAS 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be
measured and recorded at fair value.  The provisions of FAS 146 are
effective for any exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002.  We have not entered into any significant exit or disposal activities
since the effective date of this rule.  As such, FAS 146 has not had any
impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45,
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45).  FIN 45
requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a
liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee.
FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim
and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with
guarantees issued.  The recognition provisions of FIN 45 are effective for
any guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure
requirements of FIN 45 are effective for the current quarter ended February
28, 2003.

     In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company
provides routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of
intellectual property, coverage for legal issues that arise, and other items
that fall under the scope of FIN 45. Currently, the Company has several such
agreements in place.  However, based on the Company's historical experience
and estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that
the fair value of such indemnifications is not material.  Hence, the
adoption of FIN 45 has not had an impact on the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations, and no impact is expected in
the foreseeable future.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123" (FAS 148).  This statement amends SFAS No. 123
"Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" (FAS 123) to provide alternative
methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  FAS 148 also amends the
disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require disclosure of the method used
to account for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements.
The disclosure provisions will be effective for the Company beginning with
the Company's year ended May 31, 2003 10-K filing.  The annual impact of a
change to the fair value model prescribed by FAS 123 has been disclosed in
the Company's previous annual 10-K filings.  At this time, the Company plans
to continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", rather than change to the FAS
123 fair value method.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46,
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46).  This interpretation
of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements",
addresses consolidation of variable interest entities.  FIN 46 requires
certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary
beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the
parties involved.  The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for
those variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003.  The
provisions are effective for the first period beginning after June 15, 2003
for those variable interests held prior to February 1, 2003.  The Company
does not currently have any variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46.
Accordingly, the Company does not expect the provisions of FIN 46 to affect
the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 2 - Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill:
         ___________________________________________

Adoption of FAS 142

     The Company adopted  SFAS No. 142,"Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" (FAS 142) effective June 1, 2002.  In accordance with FAS 142,
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized but instead will be measured for impairment at least annually, or
when events indicate that an impairment exists.  Intangible assets that are
determined to have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives.

     As required by FAS 142, the Company performed impairment tests on
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consisted
only of certain trademarks, as of June 1, 2002.  As a result of the
impairmenttests, the Company recorded a $266.1 million cumulative effect of
accounting change.  Under FAS 142, goodwill impairment exists if the net
book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.  The
Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units by using a
combination of discounted cash flow analyses and comparisons with the market
values of similar publicly-traded companies.

     Included in the Company's $266.1 million impairment charge was a $178.5
million charge related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the
Bauer NIKE Hockey ("Bauer") and Cole Haan reporting units.  These reporting
units are reflected in the Company's "Other" operating segment.  Since the
Company's purchase of Bauer in 1995, the hockey equipment and apparel
markets have not grown as fast as expected and the in-line skate market has
contracted significantly.  As a result, we determined that the goodwill
acquired at Bauer had been impaired.  The goodwill impairment at Cole Haan
reflected the significantly lower fair value calculated on the basis of
reduced operating income in the year following the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks.

     The remaining $87.6 million of the impairment charge relates to
trademarks associated with Bauer.  Under FAS 142, impairment of an
indefinite-lived asset exists if the net book value of the asset exceeds its
fair value.  The Company estimated the fair value of trademarks using the
relief-from-royalty approach, which is a standard form of discounted cash
flow analysis typically used for the valuation of trademarks.  The
impairment of the Bauer trademarks reflects the same circumstances as
described above related to the Bauer goodwill impairment.

     The following table summarizes the Company's identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill balances as of February 28, 2003 and May 31, 2002:

</TABLE>
     Amortization expense, which is included in selling and administrative
expense, was $0.9 million and $2.7 million for the three-month and nine-month
periods ended February 28, 2003, respectively.  The estimated amortization
expense for intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the
succeeding years ended May 31, 2003 through May 31, 2007 are as follows:
2003: $3.5 million; 2004: $3.0 million; 2005: $2.8 million; 2006: $2.7
million; 2007: $2.1 million.

     The results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended February
28, 2002 do not reflect the provisions of FAS 142.  The reported net income
before cumulative effect of accounting change was $126.3 million and $459.9
million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended February 28, 2002,
respectively.  Had the Company adopted FAS 142 on June 1, 2001, for the
three-month period ending February 28, 2002, we would have recorded net
income before cumulative effect of accounting change of $129.6 million as a
result of not recording $2.2 million in goodwill amortization and $1.1
million in trademark amortization.  For the nine-month period ended February
28, 2002, net income before cumulative effect of accounting change would have
been $470.0 million as a result of not recording $6.7 million in goodwill
amortization and $3.4 million in trademark amortization.  Basic and diluted
earnings per common share before accounting change would have increased $0.01
and $0.04 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended February 28, 2002,
respectively.

NOTE 4 - Earnings Per Common Share:
         ________________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per
share to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase 12.0 million
and 4.5 million shares of common stock were outstanding at February 28, 2003
and February 28, 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation
of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the
effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 6 - Operating Segments:
         __________________


     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions with operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity.  Each NIKE
brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:  the design,
production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and
equipment. The "Other" category shown below represents activities of Cole Haan
Holdings, Inc., Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf,
and NIKE IHM, Inc., which are considered immaterial for individual disclosure.

     In prior years, operating activity for NIKE Golf was classified within
each region.  Effective June 1, 2002, NIKE Golf revenues and income from the
Company's largest golf markets have been reclassified to the Other category,
which reflects that the Company has begun managing these operations as a
separate business.  Certain NIKE Golf inventories, receivables, and property,
plant, and equipment continue to be managed by the regions, and as a result,
no reclassifications for these balances have been made.  NIKE Golf information
for the applicable prior year period has been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations.  Certain miscellaneous operating
activities have been reclassified between Corporate and the applicable
regional operating segment as of June 1, 2002, reflecting a change in the
management of these activities.  With respect to these classifications, the
applicable prior year period has been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on management pre-tax income.  On a consolidated
basis, this amount represents Income before income taxes and cumulative effect
of accounting change as shown in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Income.  Reconciling items for management pre-tax income
represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating segments for
management reporting and intercompany eliminations for specific items in the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income.

     Accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment for
operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided below:

NOTE 7 - Commitments and Contingencies:
         _____________________________

     At February 28, 2003, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling $847.5 million.  These letters of credit were issued for the
purchase of inventory.

     There have been no other significant subsequent developments
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the
Company's most recent Form 10-K.


Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies
_________________________

     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the
accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial
statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.
Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could
differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments
under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in
the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since
our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these
estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the
financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the
timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.

     As a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (FAS 142), we have
made changes to our accounting policy for goodwill and intangible assets since
May 31, 2002.  The revised policy is described following.

     We adopted FAS 142 effective June 1, 2002.  In accordance with FAS 142,
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized but instead will be measured for impairment at least annually, or
when events indicate that an impairment exists.  As required by FAS 142, in
our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible
assets to the carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of
fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over
our estimate of fair value.  Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill
and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number
of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating
performance of our reporting units.  Our estimates may change in future
periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions,
or changes to our business operations.  Such changes may result in impairment
charges recorded in future periods.

     As discussed further below, upon adoption of FAS 142 on June 1, 2002, we
recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets of $266.1 million.  This charge is shown on our statement of
income as the cumulative effect of accounting change.  In future periods, any
goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our
statement of income as part of income from continuing operations.  Other
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as
other expense, also as part of income from continuing operations.

     Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for
impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may
be impaired.  In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows
to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential
impairment exists.  If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future
undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any
impairment charges would be classified as other expense.

Operating Results
_________________

      Revenue growth in our international regions drove a 6% increase in
consolidated revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the
third quarter of fiscal 2002, due in part to the strengthening of the euro
versus the U.S. dollar.  Changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the
euro, drove 4% of the consolidated revenue growth.  Consolidated revenues
increased 7% in the first nine months of fiscal 2003 as compared to the first
nine months of fiscal 2002, also driven by increased revenues in our
international regions.  These year-to-date revenues reflected 3% growth due to
the change in currency exchange rates.

     Our largest international region, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA),
reported 8% revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to the
third quarter of fiscal 2002.  This growth reflected a 15% improvement due to
translation of sales at a higher euro exchange rate and an 11% reduction due
to changes in shipment timing due to our December 2002 supply chain system
implementation.  Consistent with our approach to the systems implementation in
the U.S. last year, we closed our European distribution center from November
27, 2002 to December 6, 2002 to prepare for the new system implementation.
Prior to the shut down period, we accelerated futures orders and deliveries
from December to October and November.  In addition, we aggressively
liquidated closeout inventory prior to the shutdown.  We estimate that these
operational adjustments moved approximately $66 million of revenue from the
third quarter to the second quarter, reducing third quarter fiscal 2003
revenue growth by approximately eleven points.  Excluding the benefit from the
change in exchange rates, revenue growth for the region was led by increased
sales in Spain and Portugal.  Although year-to-date revenues for the UK market
were essentially the same as the prior year, excluding the benefit of the
change in exchange rates, revenues for the third quarter declined year-over-
year partially as a result of the acceleration of third quarter shipments into
the second quarter.

     In the first nine months of fiscal 2003, EMEA reported revenues grew 19%
as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2002; 12 points of this growth
were due to changes in currency exchange rates.  Excluding the benefit of the
change in exchange rates, revenues grew in all three business units (footwear,
apparel, and equipment) and in most countries across the region, especially
the emerging markets in central and eastern Europe.

     EMEA management pre-tax income declined from $106.4 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 2002 to $80.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
The decline was driven by the shift in third quarter revenues to the second
quarter and incremental selling and administrative costs, partially offset by
an improvement in EMEA's gross margin percentage.  In contrast, for the first
nine months of fiscal 2003, EMEA management pre-tax income grew 27%, to $367.8
million from $289.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2002.  Higher
year-to-date revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase, more than
offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs.

     In Asia Pacific, revenues increased 17% in the third quarter of fiscal
2003; 5 points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Revenues increased 18% in the first nine months of fiscal 2003; 3 points of
this growth came from changes in currency exchange rates.  As in recent
quarters, each of our three business units experienced growth across the
region, and most countries in Asia Pacific reported higher revenues,
particularly China, Korea, and Japan.

     Management pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific region increased from
$55.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 to $81.3 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2003 and from $172.3 million in the first nine months
of fiscal 2002 to $216.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2003.
These increases reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more
than offset higher selling and administrative costs incurred to support the
higher level of revenues.

     In the Americas region, third quarter fiscal 2003 revenues decreased 4%
compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2002, which reflected a higher level
of sales more than offset by a 15% decline due to weaker currencies in Latin
American markets.  Likewise, year-to-date revenues decreased 10%, driven by a
16% decline due to changes in currency exchange rates.  Excluding the currency
exchange rate impact, the region experienced sales growth in Latin America
partially offset by weakness in Canada.

     Third quarter management pre-tax income for the Americas region grew from
$13.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $18.2 million in fiscal 2003.  On a year-to-
date basis, management pre-tax income grew 6% from $67.8 million in fiscal
2002 to $71.9 million in fiscal 2003.  For both periods, management pre-tax
income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved
gross margin percentage.

     In the U.S. region, reported revenues grew 3% in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003 versus the third quarter of last year, but declined 1% in the
first nine months of fiscal 2003 versus the first nine months of last year.
The improved revenue trend in the third quarter was partially due to last
year's acceleration of deliveries from the third quarter to the second quarter
in advance of the U.S. supply chain system implementation in December 2001.
We estimate last year's revenue acceleration improved the U.S. third quarter
fiscal 2003 revenue growth rate by four points. This revenue acceleration did
not affect year-to-date revenue growth.

     Our U.S. apparel and equipment businesses grew on a quarterly and year-
to-date basis as compared to the same periods last year.  However, our U.S.
footwear business experienced declines during the third quarter and year-to-
date period as compared to the same periods last year.  Lower sales to our
largest customer, Foot Locker, and a lower average price per pair sold drove
the year-over-year decline in U.S. footwear revenues.  We expect U.S. sales to
Foot Locker to be below prior year levels at least through the first half of
fiscal 2004.  This is a result of both lower orders from Foot Locker and
limitations we have imposed on this customer's purchase of certain products.
We are continuing to pursue incremental sales with other retailers in order to
offset the decline in revenues from Foot Locker.  Although we do not expect to
fully offset the revenue loss from Foot Locker in the U.S. in the short term,
we believe we will ultimately succeed in realigning distribution of our
products to meet consumer demand and generate profitable revenue growth in the
U.S. footwear business.

     The reduction in average price per pair in U.S. footwear between fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2002 reflected a shift in sales mix toward classic footwear
and kids models, which have a lower average price than our more complex adult
performance models.  Outstanding futures orders indicate that this trend will
continue in the near term, although we expect the rate of decline versus the
prior year to slow.

     U.S. region management pre-tax income declined 2%, from $213.6 million in
the third quarter of fiscal 2002 to $210.0 million in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003 as higher selling and administrative costs more than offset the
increase in revenues and a slight increase in gross margin percentage.  On a
year-to-date basis, U.S. management pre-tax income declined 8%, from $721.7
million in the first nine months of fiscal 2002 to $664.9 million in the first
nine months of fiscal 2003, reflecting lower revenues and higher selling and
administrative costs, partially offset by improvement in gross margins.

     Other revenues include revenues from Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Cole Haan
Holdings, Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE Golf.  Beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2003, the revenues from NIKE Golf operations in our
largest golf markets have been excluded from the revenues of the regions and
reported in the Other category, reflecting that we have begun managing these
operations as a separate business.  This NIKE Golf information for the prior
year period has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

     Other revenues grew 10% in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared
to the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and 13% in the first nine months of fiscal
2003 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2002.  The addition of
revenues from our Hurley business, purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002, drove the increase in Other revenues in both the third quarter and year-
to-date period.  Lower NIKE Golf revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2003
partially offset the increase from the Hurley business in the third quarter.
(NIKE Golf business further discussed below.)

     Other management pre-tax income declined from income of $2.7 million in
the third quarter of fiscal 2002 to a loss of $10.0 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003, and declined from income of $9.5 million in the first
nine months of fiscal 2002 to a loss of $13.8 million in the first nine months
of fiscal 2003.  Reduced NIKE Golf profits drove these declines.  The reduced
NIKE Golf profits resulted from weaker demand in the U.S. golf market in the
current year and start-up issues we experienced at a third-party distribution
facility.  We expect that demand for golf products throughout the industry and
for our business may remain weak in the near term due to the current slowdown
of the U.S. economy.  In addition, while we are actively working to resolve
the startup issues at our new distribution facility, those issues may continue
to affect our NIKE Golf revenues and profitability during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003.

     The breakdown of revenues follows:

     The previous discussion includes disclosure of "management pre-tax
income" for our operating segments.  We have reported management pre-tax
income in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".  As
discussed in Note 6-Operating Segments in the attached Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not
included in the management pre-tax income of our operating segments.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from March 2003 to July 2003 were 5.8% higher than such
orders booked in the comparable period of fiscal 2002. The percentage growth
in these orders is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue
growth in subsequent periods. This is because the mix of orders can shift
between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate
fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause
differences in the comparisons between future orders and actual revenues.
Moreover, a significant portion of our revenues is not derived from futures
orders, including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel,
Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, NIKE Golf, Hurley, and retail sales across all
brands.

     In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, our quarterly gross margin
percentage improved 1.6 points as compared to the third quarter of fiscal
2002, continuing the trend of quarter-on-quarter increases over the previous
four quarters.  Likewise, for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 compared to
the first nine months of fiscal 2002, our gross margin percentage improved 1.9
points. The primary driver of the consolidated gross margin improvement was
higher in-line apparel margins, reflecting our global initiatives to lower
sourcing and distribution costs.  The apparel improvement was partially offset
by apparel sourcing issues related to production scheduling and factory
deliveries we have experienced in the U.S. region throughout fiscal 2003.
Lower pricing of NIKE Golf products as a result of the market conditions
discussed above also had a negative impact on margins during the third quarter
of fiscal 2003.

     Third quarter selling and administrative expense increased as a
percentage of revenues from 30.2% in fiscal 2002 to 31.4% in fiscal 2003.
Year-to-date selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of
revenues from 28.5% in fiscal 2002 to 30.0% in fiscal 2003.  Both demand
creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues
in the third quarter and year-to-date period.  Third quarter demand creation
expense grew from $242.1 million to $271.7 million while year-to-date demand
creation expense increased from $734.2 million to $867.6 million.  Higher
costs incurred in the EMEA region drove the growth in demand creation expense,
reflecting, 1) a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the U.S.
dollar, which resulted in higher U.S. dollar expenses for costs that are euro-
denominated, 2) our new endorsement agreement with the Manchester United
soccer team that became effective in August 2002, and 3) a comparison to
relatively low spending in the third quarter of the prior year as we shifted
resources to the World Cup marketing campaign beginning in late fiscal 2002.
For the year-to-date period, the increase in demand creation expense also
reflected significant first quarter costs for our World Cup 2002 campaign. In
addition, we increased demand creation spending in the U.S. region despite
lower revenues, in order to drive continued consumer demand while we undergo
the realignment of product distribution discussed above.

     Operating overhead increased between the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and
the third quarter of fiscal 2002, from $440.4 million to $482.2 million, and
increased between the first nine months of fiscal 2003 and the first nine
months of fiscal 2002, from $1,322.2 million to $1,444.0 million.  Major
drivers of these increases were the stronger euro, costs related to the supply
chain systems implementation in EMEA, investments in our NIKE Golf business
infrastructure, and overhead costs associated with our recently acquired
Hurley business.

     Third quarter interest expense decreased from $12.1 million in fiscal
2002 to $10.8 million in fiscal 2003, a decline of 11%.  Year-to-date interest
expense decreased from $37.4 million in fiscal 2002 to $32.2 million in 2003,
a decline of 14%. The decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower
average debt levels, as we have continued to use operating free cash flow to
reduce total debt.

     Other income/expense was a net expense of $23.9 million compared to net
income for the same quarter of last year of $0.1 million.  Year-to-date, other
income/expense was a net expense of $48.3 million compared to a net expense of
$11.8 million in the prior year.  Significant amounts included in other
income/expense were interest income, profit sharing expense, goodwill
amortization (fiscal 2002 only), and certain foreign currency gains and
losses.

     An increase in net foreign currency losses drove the increase in other
expense versus the third quarter and first nine months of last year.  These
foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany
charges to a European subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro.  The
hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we
entered into the related hedge contracts.  These losses were offset by
favorable translation of foreign-currency denominated profits.  Therefore, the
net year-over-year effect of these hedge losses and favorable translation of
foreign currency-denominated profits is not material to our consolidated net
income for either the third quarter or the year-to-date period.  We expect
these hedge losses will continue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and will
continue to largely offset the positive translation impact of stronger foreign
currencies on consolidated net income.

     In the third quarter, we adjusted our year-to-date tax rate to 34.2%, our
estimate of our full year effective tax rate.  This rate is relatively
consistent with the effective rate for all of fiscal 2002 of 34.3%.  This
reflects that we expect higher taxes on foreign earnings due to increased
taxable income at a foreign tax jurisdiction with a relatively high tax rate,
offset by additional research credits as compared to fiscal 2002.

     Included in net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 is a
$266.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing FAS 142.  This
charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with
our Bauer NIKE Hockey subsidiary and the goodwill of our Cole Haan subsidiary,
reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than
the carrying values.  In addition, the adoption of this accounting standard
resulted in a reduction to goodwill and intangible asset amortization of $3.3
million in each quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 ($10.1
million over the year-to-date period).  See the accompanying Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

     Current world events, including the conflict in Iraq, have created
uncertainty about the future prospects for the U.S. and world economies.
Although to date we do not believe these events have had a material impact on
our business, the overall effect these events will ultimately have on the
demand for NIKE products around the world and our cost of doing business is
unclear.  In the face of this uncertainty, we are monitoring each of our
markets closely to ensure that we respond quickly to changes in local
economies and consumer trends.  As of the current date, these world events
have not caused us to revise our revenue and profit growth goals for the
remainder of fiscal 2003.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
____________________________________

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" (FAS 143).  This statement requires that a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized at fair value in
the period the obligation is incurred and the associated retirement costs be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the tangible long-lived asset.
All provisions of this statement will be effective for the Company on June 1,
2003.  We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (FAS 144). This statement
supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (FAS 121), and amends Accounting
Principles Board Statement No. 30, "Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions" (APB 30). FAS 144 requires that long-lived assets
such as property, plant, and equipment, that are to be disposed of by sale be
measured at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell. FAS 144
retains the fundamental provisions of FAS 121 for (a) recognition and
measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and (b)
measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. This statement
also retains APB 30's requirement that companies report discontinued
operations separately from continuing operations. All provisions of FAS 144
were effective for us on June 1, 2002. The adoption of FAS 144 did not have an
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, and we
do not expect any impact in the foreseeable future.

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (FAS 146).  This statement
supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)".  FAS 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  Under EITF 94-3, a
liability is recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan.  FAS
146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and
recorded at fair value.  The provisions of FAS 146 are effective for any exit
and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.  We have not
entered into any significant exit or disposal activities since the effective
date of this rule.  As such, FAS 146 has not had any impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45,
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45).  FIN 45 requires that
upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the
fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee.  FIN 45 also requires
additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued.  The
recognition provisions of FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are
effective for our third quarter of fiscal 2003.

     In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine
indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property,
coverage for legal issues that arise, and other items that fall under the
scope of FIN 45. Currently, we have several such agreements in place.  However
based on our historical experience and estimated probability of future loss,
we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not
material.  Hence, the adoption of FIN 45 has not had an impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations, and no impact is
expected in the foreseeable future.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation- Transition and Disclosure- an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 123" (FAS 148).  This statement amends SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation" (FAS 123) to provide alternative methods of voluntarily
transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.  FAS 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of FAS
123 to require disclosure of the method used to account for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both
annual and interim financial statements.  The disclosure provisions will be
effective for us beginning with our fiscal 2003 10-K filing.  The annual
impact of a change to the fair value model prescribed by FAS 123 has been
disclosed in our previous annual 10-K filings.  At this time, we plan to
continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees", rather than change to the FAS 123 fair value
method.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46,
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46).  This interpretation
of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements",
addresses consolidation of variable interest entities.  FIN 46 requires
certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary
beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the
parties involved.  The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for
those variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003.  The
provisions are effective for the first period beginning after June 15, 2003
for those variable interests held prior to February 1, 2003.  We do not
currently have any variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46.
Accordingly, we do not expect the provisions of FIN 46 to affect our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
_______________________________

     Cash provided by operations was $428.8 million in the first nine months
of fiscal 2003, compared to $504.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal
2002.  Our primary source of operating cash flow in the current period was
Income before accounting change of $493.9 million.  Cash provided by
operations was less than that of last year primarily due to a greater increase
in working capital during the current period.

     Cash used by investing activities during the first nine months of fiscal
2003 was $168.2 million, compared to $199.0 million in the same period last
year.  These amounts were comprised primarily of capital expenditures.  The
most significant capital expenditures in both periods were for computer
equipment and software related to our supply chain initiative, the spending
for which declined in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002.  In addition,
during both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, we continued investment in NIKE-owned
retail stores, primarily outside the U.S.  Finally, we incurred costs in
various distribution center projects, the most significant of which is the
construction of a new storage building in Japan during the current fiscal
year, with scheduled opening in the second half of fiscal 2004.

     Cash used by financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal
2003 was $383.9 million, up from $249.3 million in the same period in fiscal
2002.  In both years, these amounts included cash used to reduce short-term
debt, repay current maturities of long-term debt, pay dividends to
shareholders, and repurchase shares of company stock.  These uses of cash were
partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt issuances (discussed further
below) and the exercise of employee stock options and other stock issuances.

     The share repurchases were part of a $1 billion, four-year, share
repurchase program that began in fiscal 2001.  In the third quarter of fiscal
2003, we purchased 0.6 million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $26.6
million, and in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, we purchased 2.6 million
shares for $115.0 million.  To date under the program, we have purchased 10.9
million shares for $509.7 million.  We expect to fund this program from
operating free cash flow. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will
be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.

     In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for $1.0 billion.  In May 2002, we
commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows
us to issue up to $500.0 million in medium-term notes, as our capital needs
dictate.  As described in our most recent Form 10-K, during the first quarter
of fiscal 2003, we issued a total of $90.0 million in notes under this
program.  The notes have coupon rates that range from 4.80% to 5.66%. The
maturities range from July 9, 2007 to August 7, 2012. For each of the notes,
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we receive fixed
interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest
payments based on the six-month London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus a
spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as its
respective note. After issuance of these notes, $410.0 million remains
available to be issued under our medium-term note program, and another $500.0
million remains available to be issued under the remainder of the shelf
registration.  We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in
the near future depending on working capital and general corporate needs.

     As disclosed in our Form 10-K as of May 31, 2002, as of that date, we had
two committed credit facilities in place, a $600.0 million, 364-day credit
facility and a $500.0 million, multi-year facility with a group of banks.  The
364-day facility matured in November 2002, and at that time we renewed and
reduced the facility to $500.0 million.  Thus, a total of $1.0 billion is
available under the two facilities.  No borrowings are currently outstanding
under these facilities.  No other terms for these facilities have changed from
those described in our Form 10-K as of May 31, 2002.  We are currently in full
compliance with each of the covenants contained in these credit agreements and
believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the
foreseeable future.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was $106.9 million and $338.3 million outstanding at February 28, 2003
and May 31, 2002, respectively.

     Our long-term unsecured debt ratings remain at A and A2 from Standard and
Poor's Corporation (S&P) and Moody's Investor Services (Moody's),
respectively.  Our short-term debt ratings remain at A1 and P1 from S&P and
Moody's, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to
meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003 were $.14 per share.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     a)  Within the 90-day period prior to the date of this report, the
         Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
         participation of the Company's management, including the Company's
         Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
         effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure
         controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the
         Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").  Based
         upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
         Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
         procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
         information relating to the Company (including its consolidated
         subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company's Exchange Act
         filings.

     b)  There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal
         controls or in other factors which could significantly affect
         internal controls subsequent to the date the Company carried out its
         internal control evaluation.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; and that futures ordering periods may vary among products and
regions; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property; performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

                           Part II - Other Information

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings:

     NIKE settled the securities class action lawsuits that were consolidated
under the caption IN RE NIKE, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION, CV-01-332-KI, in the
United States District Court for the District of Oregon.  The settlement was
approved by the court on February 24, 2003.  We paid $8.9 million in cash,
funded by the Company's directors and officers liability insurance.  In the
settlement, NIKE and the officers and directors named in the lawsuits do not
admit, and continue to deny, any and all allegations of wrongdoing, and they
received a full release of all claims asserted in the litigation.

     In a related shareholder derivative lawsuit, Metivier v. Denunzio, et
al., 0104-04339, in the Multnomah County Circuit Court of the State of Oregon,
the defendants, including the Company and certain directors and officers,
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on March 31, 2003.  A decision on the
motion is expected in the next several months.

     There have been no other material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 3 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2002.

                                   NIKE, INC.
                   FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
                      (As adopted on February 14, 2003)
     1.     Purpose of the Plan.  NIKE, Inc. (the "Company") believes that
ownership of shares of its common stock by employees of Participating Foreign
Subsidiaries (as defined below) is desirable as an incentive to better
performance and improvement of profits, and as a means by which employees may
share in the rewards of growth and success.  The purpose of the Company's
Foreign Subsidiary Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan") is to provide a
convenient means by which employees of Participating Foreign Subsidiaries may
purchase the Company's shares and a method by which the Company may assist
and encourage such employees to become share owners.  The Company has
previously operated its Employee Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which
employees of the Company and selected U.S. subsidiaries have had a similar
opportunity to purchase Company shares.

     2.     Shares Reserved for the Plan.  There are 1,000,000 shares of the
Company's authorized but unissued or reacquired Class B Common Stock reserved
for purposes of the Plan.  The number of shares reserved for the Plan is
subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the outstanding
Class B Common Stock of the Company.  The determination of whether an
adjustment shall be made and the manner of any such adjustment shall be made
by the Board of Directors of the Company, which determination shall be
conclusive.

     3.     Administration of the Plan.  The Plan shall be administered by or
under the direction of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
which may delegate some or all of its duties and authority to one or more
Company employees.  The Compensation Committee may promulgate rules and
regulations for the operation of the Plan which may vary with local
requirements, adopt forms for use in connection with the Plan, and decide any
question of interpretation of the Plan or rights arising thereunder.  The
Compensation Committee may consult with counsel for the Company on any matter
arising under the Plan.  All determinations and decisions of the Compensation
Committee shall be conclusive.

     4.     Eligible Employees.  All Eligible Employees (as defined below) of
each subsidiary of the Company that is designated by the Compensation
Committee as a participant in the Plan (such participating subsidiary being
hereinafter called a "Participating Foreign Subsidiary") are eligible to
participate in the Plan.  An "Eligible Employee" is an employee who has been
employed by a Participating Foreign Subsidiary for at least one full month
prior to the Offering Date (as defined below) excluding, however, (a) any
employee who does not meet such additional eligibility criteria as may be
established from time to time by the Compensation Committee for defined
groups of employees, and (b) any employee who would, after a purchase of
shares under the Plan, own or be deemed (under Section 424(d) of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) to own stock
(including stock subject to any outstanding options held by the employee)
possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of
all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the
Company.

     5.     Offerings.

              (a)     Offering and Purchase Dates.  The Plan shall be
implemented by a series of six-month offerings (the "Offerings"), with a new
Offering commencing on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning with
April 1, 2003.  Each Offering commencing on April 1 of any year shall end on
September 30 of that year, and each Offering commencing on October 1 of any
year shall end on March 31 of the following year.  The first day of each
Offering is the "Offering Date" for that Offering and the last day of each
Offering is the "Purchase Date" for that Offering.

             (b)Grants; Limitations.  On each Offering Date, each Eligible
Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan to purchase shares of
Class B Common Stock on the Purchase Date for the Offering for the price
determined under paragraph 7 of the Plan exclusively through payroll
deductions or other contributions authorized under paragraph 6 of the Plan;
provided, however, that (i) no option shall permit the purchase of more than
1,000 shares, and (ii) no option may be granted under the Plan that would
allow an employee's right to purchase shares under all employee stock
purchase plans of the Company and its parents and subsidiaries to accrue at a
rate that exceeds US$25,000 of fair market value of shares (determined at the
date of grant) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding.

     6.     Participation in the Plan.

              (a)     Initiating Participation.  An Eligible Employee may
participate in an Offering under the Plan by submitting to the Company or its
agent a subscription in a form specified by the Company.  The subscription
must be submitted no later than the "Subscription Deadline," which shall be a
number of days prior to the Offering Date with the exact number of days being
established from time to time by the Compensation Committee by written notice
to Eligible Employees.  Once submitted, a subscription shall remain in effect
unless amended or terminated, and upon the expiration of an Offering the
participants in that Offering will be automatically enrolled in the new
Offering starting the following day.

              (b)     Payroll Deductions or Other Contributions.  Unless
otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with this
paragraph 6(b), each subscription shall include a payroll deduction
authorization that will authorize the employing corporation to make payroll
deductions in an amount designated by the participant from each of the
participant's paychecks during the Offering.  The designated amount to be
deducted from each paycheck must be a whole percentage of not less than one
percent or more than 10 percent of the participant's Compensation (as defined
below) for the period covered by the paycheck.  If the Compensation Committee
determines that payroll deductions are either illegal or inadvisable in any
particular jurisdiction, the Committee may provide for alternate methods of
contributing to the Plan for all participants in that jurisdiction, provided
that no participant shall be permitted to contribute less than one percent or
more than 10 percent of the participant's aggregate Compensation paid during
the Offering.  Each Participating Foreign Subsidiary will promptly remit the
amount of payroll deductions or other contributions to the Company.

               (c)     Definition of Compensation.  "Compensation" means the
gross amount of participant's base salary, hourly compensation including
overtime pay, performance bonus compensation and sales commissions, or such
other definitions of Compensation as may be established from time to time by
the Compensation Committee for defined groups of employees.

               (d)     Amending Participation.  After a participant has begun
participating in the Plan by initiating payroll deductions, the participant
may amend the payroll deduction authorization (i) once during any Offering to
decrease the amount of payroll deductions, and (ii) effective for the first
paycheck of a new Offering to either increase or decrease the amount of
payroll deductions.  A request for a decrease in payroll deductions during an
Offering must be submitted to the Company in a form specified by the Company
no later than the Change Deadline (as defined below) for that Offering, and
shall be effective for any paycheck only if the request is received by the
Company no later than the last business day of the immediately preceding
calendar month, or by such other deadline as may be established from time to
time by the Compensation Committee for defined groups of employees.  A
request for an increase or decrease in payroll deductions effective for the
first paycheck of a new Offering must be submitted to the Company in a form
specified by the Company no later than the Subscription Deadline for the new
Offering.  In addition, if the amount of payroll deductions from any
participant during an Offering exceeds the maximum amount that can be applied
to purchase shares in that Offering under the limitations set forth in
paragraph 5(b) above, then (x) as soon as practicable following a written
request from the participant, payroll deductions from the participant shall
cease and all such excess amounts shall be refunded to the participant, and
(y) payroll deductions from the participant shall restart as of the
commencement of the next Offering at the rate set forth in the participant's
then effective payroll deduction authorization.  If the Compensation
Committee provides an alternative to payroll deduction as a method of
contributing to the Plan in any jurisdiction, the Committee shall also
specify terms for amending contribution levels in that jurisdiction.

               (e)     Terminating Participation.  After a participant has
begun participating in the Plan, the participant may terminate participation
in the Plan by notice to the Company in a form specified by the Company.  To
be effective to terminate participation in an Offering, a notice of
termination must be submitted no later than the "Change Deadline," which
shall be a number of days prior to the Purchase Date for that Offering with
the exact number of days being established from time to time by the
Compensation Committee by written notice to participants.  Participation in
the Plan shall also terminate when a participant ceases to be an Eligible
Employee for any reason, including death or retirement.  A participant may
not reinstate participation in the Plan with respect to a particular Offering
after once terminating participation in the Plan with respect to that
Offering.  Upon termination of a participant's participation in the Plan, all
amounts deducted from the participant's Compensation or otherwise contributed
by the participant, and not previously used to purchase shares under the
Plan, shall be returned to the participant.

     7.     Option Price.  The price at which shares shall be purchased in an
Offering shall be in US dollars and shall be the lower of (a) 85% of the fair
market value of a share of Class B Common Stock on the Offering Date of the
Offering or (b) 85% of the fair market value of a share of Class B Common
Stock on the Purchase Date of the Offering.  The fair market value of a share
of Class B Common Stock on any date shall be the closing price on the
immediately preceding trading day of the Class B Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange or, if the Class B Common Stock is not traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, such other reported value of the Class B Common Stock as
shall be specified by the Board of Directors.

     8.     Purchase of Shares.  All amounts withheld from the Compensation
of a participant or otherwise contributed by a participant shall be credited
to his or her account under the Plan.  No interest will be paid on such
accounts, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or required
under local law.  If amounts are withheld in any currency other than US
dollars, the amounts in participants' accounts shall be converted into US
dollars based on the closing exchange rates between local currencies and US
dollars on the fourth business day prior to each Purchase Date as reported in
the Wall Street Journal.  On each Purchase Date, the amount of the account of
each participant will be applied to the purchase of shares (including
fractional shares) by such participant from the Company at the price
determined under paragraph 7 above.  Any cash balance remaining in a
participant's account after a Purchase Date as a result of the limitations
set forth in paragraph 5(b) above shall be repaid to the participant.

     9.     Delivery and Custody of Shares.  Shares purchased by participants
pursuant to the Plan will be delivered to and held in the custody of such
investment or financial firm (the "Custodian") as shall be appointed by the
Compensation Committee.  The Custodian may hold in nominee or street name
certificates for shares purchased pursuant to the Plan, and may commingle
shares in its custody pursuant to the Plan in a single account without
identification as to individual participants.  By appropriate instructions to
the Custodian, a participant may from time to time sell all or part of the
shares held by the Custodian for the participant's account at the market
price at the time the order is executed.  If a participant desires to sell
all of the shares in his or her account, the Custodian or the Company will
purchase any fraction of a share in the account at the same price per share
that the whole shares are sold on the market.  By appropriate instructions to
the Custodian, a participant may obtain (a) transfer into the participant's
own name of all or part of the whole shares held by the Custodian for the
participant's account and delivery of such whole shares to the participant,
or (b) transfer of all or part of the whole shares held for the participant's
account by the Custodian to a regular individual brokerage account in the
participant's own name, either with the firm then acting as Custodian or with
another firm; provided, however, that no shares may be transferred under (a)
or (b) until two years after the Offering Date of the Offering in which the
shares were purchased.

     10.     Records and Statements.  The Custodian will maintain the records
of the Plan.  As soon as practicable after each Purchase Date each
participant will receive a statement showing the activity of his or her
account since the preceding Purchase Date and the balance on the Purchase
Date as to both cash and shares.  Participants will be furnished such other
reports and statements, and at such intervals, as the Compensation Committee
shall determine from time to time.

     11.     Expense of the Plan.  The Company will pay all expenses incident
to operation of the Plan, including costs of record keeping, accounting fees,
legal fees, commissions and issue or transfer taxes on purchases pursuant to
the Plan, on dividend reinvestments and on delivery of shares to a
participant or into his or her brokerage account.  The Company will not pay
expenses, commissions or taxes incurred in connection with sales of shares by
the Custodian at the request of a participant.  Expenses to be paid by a
participant will be deducted from the proceeds of sale prior to remittance.

     12.     Rights Not Transferable.  The right to purchase shares under
this Plan is not transferable by a participant, and such right is exercisable
during the participant's lifetime only by the participant.  Upon the death of
a participant, any cash withheld or contributed and not previously applied to
purchase shares, together with any shares held by the Custodian for the
participant's account shall be transferred to the persons entitled thereto
under the laws of the domicile of the participant upon a proper showing of
authority.

     13.     Dividends and Other Distributions; Reinvestment.  Stock
dividends and other distributions in shares of Class B Common Stock of the
Company on shares held by the Custodian shall be issued to the Custodian and
held by it for the account of the respective participants entitled thereto.
Cash distributions other than dividends, if any, on shares held by the
Custodian will be paid currently to the participants entitled thereto.  Cash
dividends, if any, on shares held by the Custodian will be reinvested in
Class B Common Stock on behalf of the participants entitled thereto.  The
Custodian shall establish a separate account for each participant for the
purpose of holding shares acquired through reinvestment of the participant's
dividends.  On each dividend payment date, the Custodian shall receive from
the Company the aggregate amount of dividends payable with respect to all
shares held by the Custodian for participants' accounts under the Plan.  As
soon as practicable thereafter, the Custodian shall use all of the funds so
received to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock in the public market, and
shall then allocate such shares (including fractional shares) among the
dividend reinvestment accounts of the participants pro rata based on the
amount of dividends reinvested for each participant.  A participant may sell
or transfer shares in the participant's dividend reinvestment account in
accordance with paragraph 9 above, except that there shall be no holding
period required for a transfer from a dividend reinvestment account.

     14.     Voting and Shareholder Communications.  In connection with
voting on any matter submitted to the shareholders of the Company, the
Custodian will cause the shares held by the Custodian for each participant's
accounts to be voted in accordance with instructions from the participant or,
if requested by a participant, furnish to the participant a proxy authorizing
the participant to vote the shares held by the Custodian for his or her
accounts.  Copies of all general communications to shareholders of the
Company will be sent to participants in the Plan.

     15.     Tax Withholding.  In connection with purchases of shares under
the Plan, the Company shall determine the amounts, if any, required to be
withheld to satisfy any applicable tax or other withholding obligations of
Participating Foreign Subsidiaries under the laws of the jurisdictions in
which participants perform services.  The Participating Foreign Subsidiaries
shall withhold such amounts from other amounts payable to the participants,
including all forms of Compensation, subject to applicable law.

     16.     Responsibility and Indemnity.  Neither the Company, its Board of
Directors, the Compensation Committee, the Custodian, any Participating
Foreign Subsidiary, nor any member, officer, agent, or employee of any of
them, shall be liable to any participant under the Plan for any mistake of
judgment or for any omission or wrongful act unless resulting from gross
negligence, willful misconduct or intentional misfeasance.  The Company will
indemnify and save harmless its Board of Directors, the Compensation
Committee, the Custodian and any such member, officer, agent or employee
against any claim, loss, liability or expense arising out of the Plan, except
such as may result from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or
intentional misfeasance of such entity or person.

     17.     Conditions and Approvals.  The obligations of the Company under
the Plan shall be subject to compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations, compliance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the
Company's securities may be listed, and approval of such governmental
authorities or agencies as may have jurisdiction over the Plan or the
Company.  The Company will use its best effort to comply with such laws,
regulations and rules and to obtain such approvals.

     18.     Amendment of the Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company
may from time to time amend the Plan in any and all respects.

     19.     Termination of the Plan.  The Plan shall terminate when all of
the shares reserved for purposes of the Plan have been purchased, provided
that the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may at any time terminate
the Plan, either completely or with respect to any Participating Foreign
Subsidiary, without any obligation on account of such termination, except as
hereinafter in this paragraph provided.  Upon termination of the Plan, the
cash and shares, if any, held in the accounts of each participant shall
forthwith be distributed to the participant or to the participant's order,
provided that if prior to the termination of the Plan, the Board of Directors
and shareholders of the Company shall have adopted and approved a
substantially similar plan, the Board of Directors may in its discretion
determine that the accounts of each participant under this Plan shall be
carried forward and continued as the accounts of such participant under such
other plan, subject to the right of any participant to request distribution
of the cash and shares, if any, held for his accounts.

RECITALS

     (a)     NIKE, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Supplemental Executive
Savings Plan effective February 1, 1994 (the "SESP").  The SESP was adopted to
provide an opportunity for eligible employees to set aside additional amounts
for retirement on a tax deferred basis and to provide a limited make-up of
profit sharing contributions lost as a result of the limit on compensation
under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code")
under the Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for employees of
NIKE, Inc. (the "Profit Sharing Plan").  The SESP is a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan for the benefit of a select group of management or highly-
compensated employees of the Company.

     (b)     The Company adopted the Supplemental Executive Profit Sharing
Plan effective as of June 1, 1995 (the "SEPSP") to expand the make-up of
profit sharing contributions lost under the Profit Sharing Plan and to
separate the restoration provisions from the elective deferral provisions of
the SESP.

     (c)     Effective as of January 1, 1998, the Company combined the SEPSP
and the SESP and made certain other changes.  The resulting plan was renamed
the NIKE, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The Company amended
and restated the Plan, effective as of January 1, 2000.

     (d)     Effective January 1, 2003, the Company wishes again to amend and
restate the Plan to reflect a change in trustee, the addition of an
opportunity for Participants to defer payments under the Long Term Incentive
Plan of NIKE, Inc., and other administrative changes in the Plan.

     (e)     Under the Plan, the Company is obligated to pay vested accrued
benefits to Plan Participants and their Beneficiary or Beneficiaries from the
Company's general assets.

     (f)     In connection with the Plan, the Company has established an
irrevocable trust (the "Trust").  The Company intends to make contributions to
the Trust so that such contributions will be held by the Trustee and invested,
reinvested and distributed, all in accordance with the provisions of this Plan
and the Trust Agreement.

     (g)     The Company intends that amounts contributed to the Trust and the
earnings thereon shall be used by the Trustee to satisfy the liabilities of
the Company under the Plan in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

     (h)     The Company intends that the Trust be a "grantor trust" with the
principal and income of the Trust treated as assets and income of the Company
for federal and state income tax purposes.

     (i)     The Company intends that the assets of the Trust shall at all
times be subject to the claims of the general creditors of the Company as
provided in the Trust Agreement.

     (j)     The Company intends that the existence of the Trust shall not
alter the characterization of the Plan as "unfunded" for purposes of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and
shall not be construed to provide income to Plan Participants prior to actual
payment of the vested accrued benefits thereunder.

     NOW THEREFORE, the Company does hereby adopt this amended and restated
Plan as follows:

PARTICIPATION

2.1     Participation
        _____________

       An Eligible Employee, Director or Consultant shall become a Participant
in the Plan by electing to defer a portion of his or her Compensation in
accordance with Section 3.1.

ARTICLE III

DEFERRAL ELECTIONS

3.1     Elections to Defer Compensation
        _______________________________

               (a)     Initial Election Period.  Each Eligible Employee,
Director or Consultant may elect to defer Compensation by filing an election
with the Retirement Committee that conforms to the requirements of this
Section 3.1, on a form provided by the Retirement Committee, no later than the
last day of his or her Initial Election Period.  Until modified, Deferral
Elections filed with respect to the 1998 Plan Year shall supersede any and all
prior deferral elections made in connection with the Predecessor Plans.

               (b)     General Rule.  The amount of Compensation that an
Eligible Employee, Director or Consultant may elect to defer is as follows:

(1)     Any whole percentage of Salary up to 100%;

(2)     Any whole percentage of Bonus up to 100%;

(3)     Any whole percentage of Commissions up to 100%;

(4)     Any whole percentage of Fees up to 100%;

provided, however, that no election under this Section 3.1 or Section 3.4
shall be effective to reduce the Compensation and Long Term Incentive Payments
paid to an Eligible Employee to an amount that is less than the amount
necessary to pay applicable employment taxes (e.g., FICA, hospital insurance)
payable with respect to amounts deferred hereunder, amounts necessary to
satisfy any other benefit plan withholding obligations, any resulting income
taxes payable with respect to Compensation that cannot be so deferred, and any
amounts necessary to satisfy any wage garnishment or similar type obligations.

               (c)     Minimum Deferrals.  For each full Plan Year during
which the Eligible Employee is a Participant, the minimum dollar amount that
may be deferred under this Section 3.1 is $5,000 ($1,000 in the case of
Directors and Consultants).

               (d)     Effect of Initial Election.  An election to defer
Salary, Commissions or Fees made during an Initial Election Period shall be
effective as to Salary, Commissions, and Fees earned beginning with the first
pay period beginning after the Initial Election Period.  Employees who first
became Eligible Employees during a Plan Year may make an election to defer
Bonuses payable in subsequent Plan Years by making deferral elections in
accordance with subsections 3.1(e) and (f).

               (e)     Duration of Deferral Election. A Compensation deferral
election made under paragraph (a) or paragraph (f) of this Section 3.1 shall
remain in effect, notwithstanding any change in the Participant's Compensation
until modified or terminated as provided herein. A Participant may irrevocably
elect at any time to reduce the percentage to be deferred from Salary,
Commissions, and Fees earned in the remainder of the Plan Year to zero.
Subject to the minimum deferral requirement of subsection (c) of this Section,
the percentage of Salary, Bonus, Commissions and Fees designated by the
Participant for deferral may be modified by filing a new election, in
accordance with the terms of this Section, with the Committee not later than
December 15 (or such earlier date as the Committee may establish) of the year
immediately preceding the beginning of the Plan Year for which the election
shall be in effect. A Participant's deferral election shall terminate with
respect to future Compensation upon the Participant's ceasing to be an
Eligible Employee, Director or Consultant.

               (f)     Elections Other Than Elections During the Initial
Election Period.  Any Eligible Employee, Director or Consultant who fails to
elect to defer Compensation during his or her Initial Election Period may
subsequently become a Participant by filing an election, on a form provided by
the Retirement Committee, to defer Compensation as described in paragraph (b)
above.  An election to defer Compensation must be filed no later than December
15 (or such earlier date as the Retirement Committee may establish) and will
be effective for Salary, Commissions and Fees earned beginning with the first
pay period beginning on and after the beginning of the next succeeding Plan
Year and for any Bonus payable in the next succeeding Plan Year.

               (g)     Director's 1999 Transition Election.  Any Director as
of September 1, 1999, shall have made an election on or before September 24,
1999, to either remain eligible for the Director's Retirement Annuity or to
convert such annuity to the Director's 1999 Transition Retirement Benefit, in
either case such benefit not payable until the Director's Retirement.  In the
event an electing Director converted the Director's Retirement Annuity, such
election shall be irrevocable and paid as provided herein.

3.2     Company Contributions
        _____________________

               (a)     Eligibility.  An Eligible Employee who qualifies for a
contribution for a Plan Year under the Profit Sharing Plan shall be eligible
for a Company contribution under this Plan for such Plan Year if he or she
either (i) makes a Deferral Election under 3.1 for the Plan Year, or (ii)
receives compensation under the Profit Sharing Plan exceeding the Code Section
401(a)(17) limit of $200,000 (as indexed) for its Plan Year, or both.

               (b)     Company Contribution.  An Eligible Employee who is
eligible under subsection 3.2(a) shall be credited with a "Restoration Amount"
for each Plan Year.  "Restoration Amount" means the amount by which the
Eligible Employee's allocated share of the "Profit Sharing Contribution" (as
defined in the Profit Sharing Plan) for the corresponding Plan Year under the
Profit Sharing Plan would be higher if calculated on the basis of Compensation
as defined in this Plan (i) determined before any reduction for deferral of
Compensation under this Plan; and (ii) without regard to the Code Section
401(a)(17) limit.

               (c)     Discretionary Company Contributions.  In addition to
Company contributions in accordance with Section 3.2(b), the Company may, in
its sole discretion, make discretionary contributions to the Accounts of one
or more Participants at such times and in such amounts as the Board or the
Retirement Committee may determine.

               (d)     Director's Retirement Contribution. In addition to any
Company contributions made in accordance with Sections 3.2 (a)-(c), the
Company shall credit to the Accounts of any electing Director the number of
shares of Company Stock equivalent to the electing Director's 1999 Transition
Retirement Benefit.  The Company may contribute such shares corresponding to
the total of all the electing Director's benefits, at such time and in such
amount as the Board or the Committee may determine, provided that any shares
so contributed shall remain in the name of the Company (or any trust
established by the Company for this purpose), and shall be its sole property
in which no electing Director shall have any separable interest.

3.3     Investment Elections
        ____________________

     (a)Hypothetical Investment Funds. The Retirement Committee may, in its
discretion, provide each Participant with a list of investment Funds available
for hypothetical investment, and the Participant may designate, in a manner
specified by the Retirement Committee, one or more Funds that his or her
Account will be deemed to be invested in for purposes of determining the
amount of earnings to be credited to that Account.  The Retirement Committee
may, from time to time, in its sole discretion select a commercially available
fund to constitute the Fund actually selected.  The Investment Return of each
such commercially available fund shall be used to determine the amount of
earnings to be credited to Participants' Accounts under Section 4.1(e).

               (1)    Deemed Investment Elections.     In making the
designation pursuant to this Section 3.3, the Participant may specify that all
or any 1% multiple of his or her Account be deemed to be invested in one or
more of the Funds offered by the Retirement Committee.  Subject to such
limitations and conditions as the Retirement Committee may specify, a
Participant may change the designation made under this Section 3.3 in such
manner and at such time or times as the Retirement Committee shall specify.
If a Participant fails to elect a Fund under this Section 3.3, or if the
Retirement Committee shall not provide Participants with a list of Funds
pursuant to this Section 3.3, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected
a money market fund.

               (2)     No Company Obligation.  The Company may, but need not,
acquire investments corresponding to those designated by the Participants
hereunder, and it is not under any obligation to maintain any investment it
may make.  Any such investments, if made, shall be in the name of the Company,
and shall be its sole property in which no Participant shall have any
interest.

       (b)     Director's Plan Investments. A 1999 Director's Transition
Retirement Plan Subaccount shall be maintained on behalf of each Director
participating in the Plan.  The entirety of an electing Director's 1999
Transition Retirement Benefit shall be maintained in the 1999 Transition
Retirement Plan Subaccount, reflecting the number of shares of Company Stock
in which the electing Director is vested and entitled to under the Plan as his
or her 1999 Transition Retirement Benefit.  The subaccount balance shall be
expressed in units (denominated in shares of Company Stock).  The number of
units reflected in an electing Director's 1999 Transition Retirement Benefit
subaccount shall be appropriately adjusted periodically to reflect any
dividend, split, split-up or any combination or exchange, however,
accomplished, with respect to the shares of Company Stock represented by such
units.

3.4     Deferral of Long Term Incentive Payments.
        _________________________________________

       (a)     Deferral Permitted.  A Participant who is eligible for a
potential Long Term Incentive Payment may elect to defer receipt of the Long
Term Incentive Payment under the provisions of this Section 3.4.  The deferral
election shall be expressed as a percentage of the potential Long Term
Incentive Payment, in a whole percentage between zero and 100.

       (b)     Timing of Deferral-General Rule.  Long Term Incentive Payments
generally are made in August of each year, based on actual financial
performance compared against targets established by the Company for the
Company's three preceding fiscal years.  In order to defer anticipated Long
Term Incentive Payments under this Plan, a Participant must make a deferral
election no later than the December 15 (or such earlier date as the Committee
may establish) of the second calendar year preceding the calendar year in
which the Long Term Incentive Payment (if any) is payable.  For example, for
the Long Term Incentive Payment that is anticipated to be paid in August 2004,
the deferral election would have to be made no later than December 15, 2002.

       (c)     Timing of Deferral-Special Rule for First Plan Year.  For Long
Term Incentive Payments that are anticipated to be made in August 2003, the
deferral election must be made no later than September 13, 2002.

       (d)     Form of Deferral.  In order to defer Long Term Incentive
Payments into this Plan, the Participant must irrevocably agree under the Long
Term Incentive Plan to receive the Long Term Incentive Payment in the form of
cash and not as Company stock.

       (e)     Duration of Deferral Election.  A deferral election under this
Section 3.4 shall remain in effect from year to year until modified or
terminated as provided herein.  The percentage of Long Term Incentive Payments
designated by the Participant for deferral may be modified by filing a new
election, in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.4, with the Committee
not later than December 15 (or such earlier date as the Committee may
establish) of the second calendar year preceding the beginning of the Plan
Year for which the election shall be in effect.

       (f)     Irrevocable Election.  A Participant's election to defer
receipt of a Long Term Incentive Payment under this Plan is irrevocable with
respect to the Long Term Incentive Payment to which the deferral election
relates.

       (g)     Administration.  Long Term Incentive Payments deferred under
this section shall be accounted for as part of the Participant's Account and
subject to the investment, distribution, and other provisions applicable to
such Accounts.

ARTICLE IV

ACCOUNTS

4.1     Participant Accounts
        ____________________

                The Retirement Committee shall establish and maintain an
Account for each Participant under the Plan.  Each Participant's Account may
be further divided into separate subaccounts ("investment fund subaccounts"),
corresponding to investment Funds elected by the Participant pursuant to

necessary or appropriate for proper Plan administration.  A Participant's
Account shall be credited as follows:

invested in a certain type of investment Fund shall be credited to the
investment fund subaccount corresponding to that investment Fund.

               (b)     Bonus Deferrals.  As soon as practicable after each

Participant has elected to be deemed to be invested in a certain type of
investment Fund shall be credited to the investment fund subaccount
corresponding to that investment Fund.

benefit in accordance with Section 3.2; that is, the portion of the
Participant's Company contribution, if any, that the Participant has elected
to be deemed to be invested in a certain type of investment Fund shall be
credited to the investment fund subaccount corresponding to that investment

an amount equal to the portion of the Long Term Incentive Payment deferred by
the Participant's election under Section 3.4.

               (e)     Investment Returns.  On each Valuation Date, each
investment fund subaccount of a Participant's Account shall be adjusted for
deemed Investment Returns in an amount equal to that determined by multiplying

the preceding Valuation Date by the Investment Return for the corresponding
Fund selected by the Company.

discretion, to equitably protect the interests of all Participants.

ARTICLE VII

DISTRIBUTIONS

7.1     Distribution of Deferred Compensation - Termination of Service.
        ______________________________________________________________

(a)     Retirement; Disability; Death.
        _____________________________

               (1)     Form of Payment.  In the event a Participant's Service
terminates as a result of Retirement, long-term disability (as defined in the
Company's long-term disability plan for employees) or death, and provided
further that such Participant does not return to Service prior to the Payment
Commencement Date, the Participant's Distributable Amount shall be paid to the
Participant (and after his or her death to his or her Beneficiary) in
substantially equal quarterly installments over 15 years beginning on his or
her Payment Commencement Date.  If the Participant's Distributable Amount is
paid in installments, the Participant's Account value shall continue to be
adjusted for investment returns pursuant to Section 4.1(e) of the Plan and the
installment amount shall be adjusted as of each December 31 for installments
payable in the following year to reflect gains and losses until all amounts
credited to the Participant's Account under the Plan have been distributed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, in lieu of quarterly
installments over 15 years, elect a cash lump sum payment or quarterly
installments over five or 10 years by filing an election with the Retirement
Committee within 30 days of the date he or she first becomes a Participant.

              (2)     Change in Form.  A Participant may change his or her
form of distribution under this subsection 7.1(a) provided that his or her
change is filed with the Retirement Committee at least one year prior to his
or her Payment Commencement Date; otherwise, the most recent distribution
election made by the Participant one (1) or more years prior to the Payment
Commencement Date shall govern.

               (3)     Small Benefit Amounts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Participant's Distributable Amount is $25,000 or less, the
Distributable Amount shall automatically be distributed in the form of a cash
lump sum on the Participant's Payment Commencement Date.

               (4)     Section 162(m).  Amounts payable pursuant to this
subsection 7.1(a) shall be subject to the limitation on payout under Section
7.5.

               (b)     Other Termination.  In the case of a Participant whose
Service with the Company terminates for any reason other then Retirement,
long-term disability, or death, the Participant's Distributable Amount shall
be paid to the Participant in the form of a cash lump sum on the Participant's
Payment Commencement Date, provided that no such distribution shall occur in
the event the Participant returns to Service prior to the Payment Commencement
Date.

               (c)     Death While Receiving Benefits.  If the Participant is
in pay status at the time of death, the Beneficiary shall be paid the
remaining quarterly installments as they come due.

7.2     Scheduled and Unscheduled Withdrawals
        _____________________________________

               (a)     Scheduled Withdrawals.  A Participant may, in
connection with his or her Compensation deferral election for a Plan Year,
specify a withdrawal (a "Scheduled Withdrawal") of all of his or her Account
attributable to Compensation deferred for such Plan Year, subject to the
following restrictions:

               (1)     Three Year Rule.  A Participant's Scheduled Withdrawal
election must specify a Scheduled Withdrawal date that is at least three years
from the date the election is received by the Company.

               (2)     Procedure.  The election to take a Scheduled Withdrawal
shall be made by filing a form provided by and filed with the Retirement
Committee.

               (3)     Amount Distributable.  The amount payable to a
Participant in connection with a Scheduled Withdrawal shall in all cases be
100 percent of the Compensation deferred for the Plan Year to which the
Scheduled Withdrawal election applies, together with any earnings credited to
such deferrals pursuant to Section 4.1(e), determined as of the Valuation Date
immediately preceding the Payment Commencement Date, provided that:

               (A)     at the time of making a deferral election under Article
III, a Participant may make a different Scheduled Withdrawal election for Long
Term Incentive Payments than for other forms of Compensation deferred for the
Plan Year; and

               (B)     no portion of the Account attributable to Company
contributions described in Section 3.2, if any, shall be eligible for
Scheduled Withdrawal.

               (4)     Postponement.  A Participant may, at least one year
prior to a Scheduled Withdrawal date, revoke his or her Scheduled Withdrawal
election in favor of a later Scheduled Withdrawal date that is at least one
year later, provided that a Participant may not postpone a Scheduled
Withdrawal more than twice.

               (5)     Form.  Subject to Section 7.5, payment of a Scheduled
Withdrawal shall be made in a single lump sum as soon as practicable after the
Scheduled Withdrawal date.

               (6)     Effect of Termination.  A Participant's Scheduled
Withdrawal election shall become void and of no effect upon termination of the
Participant's employment with the Company for any reason before the
Participant's scheduled withdrawal date.  In such event, the distribution
provisions of Section 7.1 shall apply.

               (b)     Unscheduled Withdrawals.  Participants may request a
withdrawal of amounts from their Accounts attributable to Compensation
deferrals prior to termination of Service (an "Unscheduled Withdrawal") or a
Scheduled Withdrawal.  Upon receiving an Unscheduled Withdrawal request, the
Retirement Committee shall determine, in its discretion as applied in a
uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, whether to permit any such Unscheduled
Withdrawal and the amount, if any, to be withdrawn, subject to the following
restrictions:

               (1)     Procedure.  The election to take an Unscheduled
Withdrawal shall be made by filing a form provided by and filed with the
Retirement Committee.

               (2)     Amount.  The amount payable to a Participant in
connection with an Unscheduled Withdrawal shall in all cases equal 90% of the
amount requested by the Participant or, if lesser, 90% of the Unscheduled
Withdrawal amount approved by the Retirement Committee; provided, however,
that the maximum amount payable to a Participant in connection with an
Unscheduled Withdrawal shall be 90% of the Distributable Amount as of the
Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of the Unscheduled Withdrawal,
and provided further, that no portion of the amount attributable to Company
contributions pursuant to Section 3.2, if any, shall be eligible for an
Unscheduled Withdrawal.

               (3)     Forfeiture.  If a Participant receives an Unscheduled
Withdrawal, the remaining portion of the requested or approved amount, as
applicable (i.e., 10% of such amount), shall be permanently forfeited and the
Company shall have no obligation to the Participant or his Beneficiary with
respect to such forfeited amount.  The Company may use the forfeitures to pay
Plan expenses, to reduce future Company contributions, or for any other legal
purpose, consistent with the terms of the Trust.

               (4)     Suspension of Participation.  If a Participant receives
an Unscheduled Withdrawal, the Participant shall be ineligible to Participate
in the Plan for the balance of the Plan Year in which the Unscheduled
Withdrawal occurs and the following Plan Year.

               (5)     Limit on Unscheduled Withdrawals.  A Participant shall
be limited to two Unscheduled Withdrawals during the entire period of his or
her Plan participation.

               (6)     Partial Unscheduled Withdrawals.  An Unscheduled
Withdrawal pursuant to this Section 7.2 of less than 90% of the Participant's
Distributable Amount shall be made pro rata from his or her assumed
investments according to the balances in such investments.  Subject to the
foregoing and subject to the Retirement Committee's approval, payment of any
amount with respect to which a Participant has filed a request under this
Section 7.2 shall be made in a single cash lump sum as soon as practicable
after the Unscheduled Withdrawal election is approved.

7.3     Unforeseeable Emergency
        _______________________

               The Retirement Committee may, pursuant to rules adopted by it
and applied in a uniform manner, accelerate the date of distribution of a
Participant's Account because of an Unforeseeable Emergency at any time.
"Unforeseeable Emergency" shall mean an unforeseeable, severe financial
condition resulting from (a) a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of
the Participant or his or her dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the
Code); (b) loss of the Participant's property due to casualty; or (c) other
similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of
events beyond the control of the Participant, but which may not be relieved
through other available resources of the Participant, as determined by the
Retirement Committee in accordance with uniform rules adopted by it.  Unless
the Retirement Committee, in its discretion, determines otherwise,
distribution pursuant to this subsection of less than the Participant's entire
interest in the Plan shall be made pro rata from his or her assumed
investments according to the balances in such investments.  Subject to the
foregoing, payment of any amount with respect to which a Participant has filed
a request under this subsection shall be made in a single cash lump sum as
soon as practicable after the Retirement Committee approves the Participant's
request.

7.4     Change of Control
        _________________

       Notwithstanding anything in this Article 7 to the contrary, including,
but not limited to, Section 7.5 below, the Distributable Amount shall be paid
to each Participant, or to the Beneficiary of each deceased Participant,
within 30 days after the date of a Change of Control.  Such amount shall be
paid in such form as elected by the Participant with respect to a distribution
by reason of the Participant's Retirement or, if no such election has been
filed, in a lump sum.

7.5     Section 162(m) Limitation
        _________________________

       If the Retirement Committee determines in good faith prior to a Change
of Control that there is a reasonable likelihood that all or any portion of
any payment of benefits under this Article 7 to a Participant would not be
deductible for federal income tax purposes by the Company because of a
limitation on the total amount of the Participant's deductible compensation
from the Company, including any other such compensation already paid to the
Participant earlier in the same fiscal year of the Company, the following
shall apply:

               (a)     Deferred Payment.  Payment of the non-deductible amount
shall be deferred until the first day of the following fiscal year of the
Company;

               (b)     Additional Deferral.  If the amount deferred under
subsection (a) would exceed the limitation of the total amount of the
Participant's deductible compensation from the Company for the following
fiscal year, the excess shall be deferred to the first day of the succeeding
fiscal year in which the deductibility of compensation paid or payable to the
Participant will not be so limited, subject to subsection (c);

               (c)     Limit on Deferral.  In no event shall any payment be
deferred under this Section 7.5 more than three years from the date scheduled
for payment under this Section 7;

               (d)     Investment Returns.  Adjustment for earnings shall
continue to be applied under Section 4.1(e) during the period of deferral
under this Section 7.5.

7.6     Inability To Locate Participant
        _______________________________

               In the event that the Retirement Committee is unable to locate
a Participant or Beneficiary within two years following the Participant's
Distribution Event, the amount allocated to the Participant's Deferral Account
shall be forfeited.  If, after such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary
later claims such benefit, such benefit (calculated immediately prior to the
forfeiture) shall be reinstated without interest or earnings.

ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1     Unsecured General Creditor
         __________________________

               Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and
assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims, or interests in any
specific property or assets of the Company.  No assets of the Company shall be
held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations
of the Company under this Plan.  Any and all of the Company's assets shall be,
and remain, the general unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Company.  The
Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and
unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in the future, and the rights of
the Participants and Beneficiaries shall be no greater than those of unsecured
general creditors.

10.2     Restriction Against Assignment
         ______________________________

               The Company shall pay all amounts payable hereunder only to the
person or persons designated by the Plan and not to any other person or
corporation.  No part of a Participant's Account shall be liable for the
debts, contracts, or engagements of any Participant, his or her Beneficiary,
or successors in interest, nor shall a Participant's Account be subject to
execution by levy, attachment, or garnishment or by any other legal or
equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate,
anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any benefits or payments
hereunder in any manner whatsoever.  If any Participant, Beneficiary or
successor in interest is adjudicated bankrupt or purports to anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any distribution
or payment from the Plan, voluntarily or involuntarily, the Retirement
Committee, in its discretion, may cancel such distribution or payment (or any
part thereof) to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary or
successor in interest in such manner as the Retirement Committee shall direct.

10.3     Withholding
         ___________

               There shall be deducted from each payment made under the Plan
all taxes, which are required to be withheld by the Company in respect to such
payment.  The Company shall have the right to reduce any payment by the amount
of cash sufficient to provide the amount of said taxes.

10.4     Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Termination
         __________________________________________________

               The Retirement Committee may amend, modify, suspend or
terminate the Plan in whole or in part, except that no amendment,
modification, suspension or termination shall have any retroactive effect to
reduce any amounts allocated to a Participant's Account, provided that a
termination or suspension of the Plan or any Plan amendment or modification
that will significantly increase costs to the Company shall be approved by the
Board.  In the event that this Plan is terminated, the timing of the
disposition of the amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall occur in
accordance with Section 7.1, subject to earlier distribution at the discretion
of the Retirement Committee.

10.5     Governing Law
         _____________

               This Plan shall be construed, governed and administered in
accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon.

10.6     Receipt or Release
         __________________

               Any payment to a Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary
in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be
in full satisfaction of all claims against the Retirement Committee and the
Company.  The Retirement Committee may require such Participant or
Beneficiary, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt
and release to such effect.

10.7     Payments on Behalf of Persons Under Incapacity
         ______________________________________________

               In the event that any amount becomes payable under the Plan to
a person who, in the sole judgment of the Retirement Committee, is considered
by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt
therefore, the Retirement Committee may direct that such payment be made to
any person found by the Retirement Committee, in its sole judgment, to have
assumed the care of such person.  Any payment made pursuant to such
determination shall constitute a full release and discharge of the Retirement
Committee and the Company.

10.8     No Employment Rights
         ____________________

               Participation in this Plan shall not confer upon any person any
right to be employed by the Company or any other right not expressly provided
hereunder.

10.9     Headings, etc.  Not Part of Agreement.
         _____________________________________

               Headings and subheadings in this Plan are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in the construction
of the provisions hereof.

10.10    Tax Liabilities from Plan.
         _________________________

       If, due to a change in applicable law or regulations or enforcement
activity by the Internal Revenue Service, all or any portion of a
Participant's benefit under this Plan generates a state or federal income tax
liability to the Participant prior to receipt, the provision or provisions of
the Plan that would generate such taxation shall be considered null and void
to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to avoid the tax liability.
If, notwithstanding the actions taken to avoid the tax liability, a tax
liability is generated before a Participant is eligible to receive a Plan
benefit, each affected Participant may petition the Retirement Committee for a
distribution of funds sufficient to meet such liability (including additions
to tax, penalties and interest).  Upon the grant of such a petition, which
grant shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall distribute to the
Participant immediately available funds in an amount equal to that
Participant's federal, state and local tax liability associated with such
taxation, which liability shall be measured by using that Participant's then
current highest federal, state and local marginal tax rate, plus the rates or
amounts for the applicable additions to tax, penalties and interest.  At the
discretion of the Company, this distribution may or may not include an
additional amount to "gross up" the tax liability distribution to include all
applicable taxes on the tax liability distribution and the grossed up amount.
If the petition is granted, the tax liability distribution (including gross-
up) shall be made as soon as practicable after the date when the Participant's
petition is granted.  Such a distribution shall reduce the benefits to be paid
under Article VII of the Plan.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this document to be executed
by its duly authorized officer on this _____ day of _______________, 2002.
