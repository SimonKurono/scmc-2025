NOTE 3 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 

SFAS 128, "Earnings per Share," replaces primary and fully diluted 
earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share.  Under the new 
requirements, the dilutive effect of stock options is excluded from the 
calculation of basic earnings per share.  Diluted earnings per share is 
calculated similarly to fully diluted earnings per share as required under 
APB 15.  SFAS 128 became effective for the Company's fiscal 1998 financial 
statements.  All prior period earnings per share data presented have been 
restated to conform to the provisions of this statement.  The following 
represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings 
per share:

NOTE 5 - Restructuring charges:

1998 Charge

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 the Company recorded a 
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's 
actions to better align its cost structure with expected revenue growth rates.  
The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular format) primarily related 
to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities company-wide, resulting in costs 
to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease abandonments related 
to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and elimination of, certain
job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong, resulting in
reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and other costs of downsizing the 
Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the Company's Japan distribution 
center, resulting in the write-down of assets no longer in use; 4) the 
cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term endorsement contracts, resulting
in one-time termination fees; and 5) the decision to exit certain manufacturing 
operations of the Bauer subsidiary, resulting in the reduction in manufacturing 
related jobs, the write-down of assets no longer in use and the estimated loss 
on divestiture of certain manufacturing plants.

     No increases to the 1998 restructuring charge were made during the first 
nine months of fiscal 1999.  A total of  $6.7 million of the restructuring 
accrual was not required due to changes in estimates related to severance 
payments of $1.1 million, a $3.1 million change in estimated vendor software 
costs related to Japan's software development, lease commitments of $1.5 million
due to earlier sub-leasing than originally anticipated and other changes of $1.0
million.  This amount is included in other expense on the income statement.  

1999 Charge

     In the second quarter of fiscal 1999, an $18.7 million restructuring charge
was taken due to further cost realignment programs in the Company's Asia Pacific
region.  An additional $0.8 million charge was added to this restructuring 
accrual during the current quarter which relates to similar plans announced in 
other countries in the region.  The charge (detailed below in tabular format) 
was for costs of severing employees, including severance packages, lease 
abandonments and the write down of assets no longer in use.  The charge is 
included in other expense on the income statement.

     As of February 28, 1999, there were a total of 1,208 employees terminated 
in the original plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, with 1,180 
having left the Company as of that date. An additional 287 employees were 
terminated in the plan announced during the second and third quarters of fiscal 
1999 with 241 having left the Company as of February 28, 1999.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results
_________________

     Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 1999 was $124.2 million, a 
70% increase compared to the $73.1 million in the prior year's third quarter.  
Year-to-date net income decreased 24% to $357.0 million.  The increase in net 
income for the quarter was the result of both a higher gross margin percentage 
and lower selling and administrative spending.  For the year, revenues and gross 
margin trail last year, however the affect is somewhat offset by decreased 
levels of selling and administrative expenses.

     Consolidated revenues decreased 2%, or $47.2 million for the quarter, and 
9%, or $650.7 million year-to-date.  U.S. brand revenues in the quarter were 
fairly equal to last year's, increasing 1% to $1.159 million.  Year-to-date U.S. 
revenues decreased 8%, with a 9% drop in both footwear and apparel.  This 
quarter was the first in five where U.S. revenues have exceeded the comparable 
period.  The positive trend came from footwear, where revenues were up 4% in the 
quarter.  The increase came from a 3% increase in pairs sold and a 1% increase 
in average selling price.  Two of the largest categories, Running and Brand 
Jordan, were up 28% and 27%, respectively.  U.S. Apparel was down 8% in the 
quarter.  The largest categories, Men's Branded Athletic and Team Sports, were 
down 18% and 5%, respectively.  For the year the same categories were down 24% 
and 9%, respectively.  Categories that experienced increases in the quarter 
included basketball, up 17%, running, up 15%, and Brand Jordan, up 5%.

     Total revenues in Europe were up 5%, or $28.5 million for the quarter.  For 
the year, revenues have increased 8%.   Had the dollar remained constant, 
revenues would have decreased 3% and increased 2% for the quarter and year-to-
date, respectively.  The revenue increase continues to be driven by growth in 
apparel, which increased 15% in the quarter (33% year-to-date), while footwear 
revenues were down.  

     Revenues in the Asia Pacific region remain affected by the general economic 
crisis in the area.  Revenues decreased 19% for the quarter and 39% year-to-
date.  Had the dollar remained constant, revenues would have decreased 24% and 
34%, respectively.  Revenues in Japan, the Company's second largest subsidiary, 
declined 26% (33% on a constant dollar basis) for the quarter and 47% for the 
year (43% on a constant dollar basis).

     Revenues in the Americas region decreased 22% for the quarter and 16% year-
to-date, compared to last year.  Results have been driven primarily by Canada, 
the largest country in the region, which has been experiencing a sluggish retail 
environment similar to the United States.  The strengthening of the dollar, 
mostly in Canada and Mexico, has also affected results, with revenue down 18% 
for the quarter and 10% year-to-date, on a constant dollar basis in the region.

     Other Brands, which includes Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, Nike Team Sports 
(formally Sports Specialties), and NIKE IHM (which includes what was formally 
Tetra Plastics), decreased 5% for the quarter and less than 1% year-to-date.

     The Company's gross margin percentage for the third quarter was 37.3%, up 
from 35.8% in the prior year.  On a year-to-date basis, margins were down 
slightly to 37.0% from 37.8% in the prior year.  The improvement in margins for 
the quarter was mainly attributable to the focus on inventory clean up efforts 
achieved in previous quarters.  In the USA and Asia Pacific regions, closeout 
product has been reduced dramatically, thereby minimizing the impact of 
discounted sales in those regions during the quarter. 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses have decreased 13% from last year's 
third quarter and 8% year-to-date.  Expenses for the quarter are also down as a 
percentage of revenues, and are only up slightly on a year-to-date basis.  
Reductions in spending came from virtually every area of the Company's 
operations in the Company's continued efforts to better align its cost structure 
with overall revenue levels.  The reductions include wage and wage-related 
costs, despite the effects of continued retail outlet store growth around the 
world.

     Interest expense has decreased for both the quarter and year-to-date 
periods, compared to last year, as the Company needed less short term debt to 
finance lower levels of inventories and accounts receivable.  Other expense has 
increased over the prior year, mainly due to the $19.5 million restructuring 
charge (discussed further below).  In addition, $18 million was charged to 
expense in the current fiscal year, $10.7 million during the third quarter, 
relating to capital projects that have been discontinued.  Offsetting these 
charges was a $6.7 million reversal of fiscal 1998's restructuring charge.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear and 
apparel scheduled for delivery between March and July 1999 totaled $3.8 billion, 
4% lower than such orders for the same period last year.  These orders and the 
percentage change in these orders are not necessarily indicative of the change 
in revenues which the Company will experience for subsequent periods.  This is 
due to potential shifts in the mix of advance orders in relation to at once 
orders and varying cancellation rates.  Finally exchange rate fluctuations will 
also cause differences in the comparisons.

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company recorded a 
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's 
actions to better align its overall cost structure and organization with planned 
revenue levels. The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular format) 
primarily related to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities company-wide, 
resulting in costs to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease 
abandonments related to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and 
elimination of, certain job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters in 
Hong Kong, resulting in reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and other 
costs of downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the 
Company's Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-down of assets no 
longer in use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term 
endorsement contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; and 5) the 
decision to exit certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer subsidiary, 
resulting in the reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the write-down of 
assets no longer in use and the estimated loss on divestiture of certain 
manufacturing plants.

     No increases to the 1998 restructuring charge were made during the first 
nine months of fiscal 1999.  A total of  $6.7 million of the restructuring 
accrual was not required due to changes in estimates related to severance 
payments of $1.1 million, a $3.1 million change in estimated vendor software 
costs related to Japan's software development, lease commitments of $1.5 million 
due to earlier sub-leasing than originally anticipated and other changes of $1.0 
million.  This amount is included in other expense on the income statement.  The 
remaining liability balance is expected to be paid by the end of the fiscal 
year, except for certain lease payments that will fall into the first quarter of 
fiscal 2000.  The only remaining non-cash item, relating to the disposal of 
sales exhibits, will be finalized by May 31, 1999.

     In the second quarter of fiscal 1999, an $18.7 million restructuring charge 
was taken due to further cost realignment programs in the Company's Asia Pacific 
region.  An additional $0.8 million charge was added to this restructuring 
accrual during the current quarter which related to similar plans announced in 
other countries in the region.  The charge (detailed below in tabular format) 
was for costs of severing employees, including severance packages, lease 
abandonments and the write down of assets no longer in use.  The charge is 
included in other expense on the income statement.  The majority of the 
liability balance will be paid by May 31, 1999, excluding certain lease 
arrangements which will continue to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 
2000.

     As of February 28, 1999, there were a total of 1,208 employees terminated 
in the original plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, with 1,180 
having left the Company as of that date. An additional 287 employees were 
terminated in the plans announced during the second and third quarters of fiscal 
1999, with 241 having left the Company as of February 28, 1999.

Detail of the 1998 restructuring charge is as follows:

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments 
and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133).  FAS 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters 
of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 (June 1, 2000 for the 
Company).  This statement will require the Company to recognize all derivatives 
on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives 
will be recorded in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on 
the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  The 
ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current-period earnings.  
Management of the Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of 
FAS 133 will have on the Company's results from operations or its financial 
position.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

     The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs using two digits 
rather than four to define the applicable year.  Such software may recognize a 
date using "00" as the year 1900 or some other year, rather than the year 2000.  
This could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions 
in NIKE's activities and operations (the "Year 2000" or "Y2K" issue).  If we or 
our significant suppliers or customers fail to make necessary modifications, 
conversions and contingency plans on a timely basis, the Year 2000 issue could 
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations 
or liquidity. 

STATE OF READINESS

     Project Categories

     In May 1997, NIKE established a corporate-wide project team to oversee, 
monitor and coordinate the Company-wide Year 2000 effort.  Our Year 2000 project 
focuses on three areas: (1) information technology ("IT") systems, such as 
application software, mainframes, PCs, networks and production control systems; 
(2) non-IT systems, such as equipment, machinery, climate control and security 
systems, which may contain microcontrollers with embedded technology; and (3) 
suppliers and customers.  

     NIKE uses a four-phase approach to fix or replace non-compliant IT systems:

     (1)      inventory, assessment of risks and impact and prioritization of
              projects:

              -  Tier 1-critical (vital to business operations) 

              -  Tier 2-high priority (important to business operations)

              -  Tier 3-moderate priority (minor disruption to operations 
                 expected if non-compliant)

              -  Tier 4-low priority (will not disrupt operations even if non-
                 compliant);

      (2)    remediation (fix, replace or develop contingency plans for non-
             compliant systems); 

      (3)    testing (validation) and implementation; and 

      (4)    completion and auditing results where appropriate. 

When appropriate, we have engaged the services of independent consultants to 
analyze and develop testing standards, quality assurance and contingency plans.  
We use our internal auditing department to review Year 2000 compliance and have 
consulted with external independent consultants to evaluate and review those 
results.

     IT Projects
   
     By early 1999, we had identified 148 major internal IT remediation projects 
worldwide. We have completed our assessment and prioritization of all of our IT 
systems.  Of the 148 projects, we have completed and tested 71 as Year 2000 
compliant as of March 31, 1998.  Of the remaining 77 projects, we have 
consolidated 37 small projects into nine global projects to accelerate their 
completion.  Of the remaining 40 projects, we have classified five as Tier 1 and 
nine as Tier 2.  NIKE expects that half of these 14 Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects 
will be completed as Year 2000 compliant by May 31, 1999.  For the other half, 
we expect to finish remediation and be in final testing by August 31, 1999, and 
to be completed as Year 2000 compliant by November 30, 1999.  We have classified 
the remaining 26 projects as Tier 3 or Tier 4.  NIKE expects that all of these 
projects will be completed as Year 2000 compliant by July 31, 1999.

     Non-IT Projects

     By early 1999, we had identified 27 major internal non-IT remediation 
projects worldwide.  We have completed our assessment and prioritization of all 
of our major non-IT projects.  We have designated all 27 of these projects as 
high priority.  These include facilities that are critical to NIKE's business 
operations, which may involve equipment, machinery, climate control and security 
systems.  We are currently remediating these priority non-IT projects and expect 
to complete all priority non-IT projects as Year 2000 compliant by August 31, 
1999.  We have classified the remaining non-IT projects as non-priority non-IT 
projects, which include climate control, security and mechanical systems in 
buildings that are not critical to our business operations.  To the extent that 
these non-priority non-IT projects may not be completed by December 31, 1999, we 
do not expect that any non-compliance or failure of any non-priority non-IT 
systems, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect 
on NIKEs manufacturing, distribution, inventory control or the management and 
collection of our accounts receivable.  For this reason, we have not set a 
completion date for remediation of the remaining non-priority non-IT systems.

     Suppliers and Customers

     We have focused our Year 2000 compliance efforts on our significant 
suppliers and customers-those that are material to our business-and are 
assessing the Year 2000 readiness of these significant suppliers and customers.  
We have assessed the Year 2000 readiness of 460 of our suppliers, 168 of which 
we consider to be significant suppliers.  We have also assessed the Year 2000 
readiness of 151 customers, 80 of which we consider to be significant customers.  
We have relationships with significant suppliers and customers in most of the 
locations in which we operate.  See "Manufacturing" above.  The level of 
preparedness of our significant suppliers and customers can vary greatly from 
operation to operation and country to country.  NIKE relies on suppliers to 
timely deliver a broad range of goods and services worldwide, including raw 
materials, footwear, apparel, accessories, equipment, advertising, 
transportation services, banking services, telecommunications and utilities.  
Moreover, our suppliers rely on countless other suppliers, over which we may 
have little or no influence regarding Year 2000 compliance.  

     We have sent surveys to all of our significant suppliers and customers to 
determine the extent to which we may be affected by those third parties' Y2K 
preparedness plans.  A substantial majority of our significant suppliers and 
customers have not responded to our surveys, or have not provided assurance of 
their Year 2000 readiness, or have not responded with sufficient detail for us 
to determine their Year 2000 readiness.  In the absence of adequate responses, 
we are making independent assessments of our significant suppliers and customers 
and the countries in which they operate, which include direct contact and 
discussions with persons coordinating Y2K compliance efforts for our significant 
suppliers and customers.  We also research regulatory filings and other public 
information available to NIKE provided by our significant suppliers and 
customers and, in general, countries in which they operate.

CONTINGENCY PLANS

     Having completed our identification and assessment of major projects, our 
"worst-case scenario" would be a failure of multiple significant suppliers to 
supply merchandise or services for a prolonged period of time that would 
materially impair our ability to ship product in a timely and reliable manner to 
our customers.  Although the occurrence of this scenario could have a material 
adverse effect on NIKE, we do not have a basis to determine at this time whether 
such a scenario is reasonably likely to occur.  We believe that suppliers 
present the area of greatest risk to disruption of our operations because of our 
limited ability to influence actions of third parties or to estimate the level 
and impact of noncompliance of third parties throughout the extended supply 
chain.

     We are currently developing contingency plans for our significant suppliers 
and customers, which we expect to finalize by August 31, 1999.  In addition, we 
are developing contingency plans that assume some estimated level of 
noncompliance by, or business disruption to, certain other suppliers and 
customers on a case-by-case basis, which we will continue to develop on an as-
needed basis throughout 1999.  We are also developing contingency plans for our 
Tier 1 IT systems, which plans we expect to finalize by August 31, 1999.

     The contingency plans for our suppliers and customers include, where 
appropriate, (a) booking orders and manufacturing and shipping products before 
anticipated business disruptions, (b) shifting production capacity from 
facilities that NIKE determines to be at high risk of noncompliance or business 
disruption, (c) consolidating finance vendors and (d) temporarily discontinuing 
business with suppliers determined to be high risk of noncompliance or business 
disruption and finding alternative suppliers.  

     The contingency plans for our Tier 1 IT systems include, where appropriate, 
(a) manual work processes, (b) storing additional sets of backup data before 
critical process dates, (c) off-site system recovery and (d) temporarily 
shifting production software from one hardware system to another.

     We continually update our assessments and revise our contingency plans for 
our significant suppliers and customers as we receive additional information 
from them concerning their Y2K preparedness.   However, judgments regarding 
contingency plans-such as how to develop them and to what extent-are subject to 
many variables and uncertainties.  There can be no assurance that NIKE will 
correctly anticipate the level, impact or duration of noncompliance by its 
suppliers and customers.   As a result, there is no certainty that our 
contingency plans will be sufficient to mitigate the impact of noncompliance by 
suppliers and customers and some material adverse effect to NIKE may result from 
one or more third parties regardless of our contingency plans.  The failure of 
any such contingency plan could have a material adverse effect on NIKE's 
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

     COSTS 

     As of February 28, 1999, NIKE estimates that total costs related to the 
Year 2000 issue will be approximately $105 to $120 million, of which 
approximately $78 million have been incurred.  Of the $78 million, approximately 
$20 million are external expenses, $17 million internal costs and $41 million 
replacement projects.  Approximately $10 million of these expenses will be 
capitalized; the remainder has been expensed as incurred.  We presently believe 
that the total cost of achieving Year 2000 compliant systems will not be 
material to our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  NIKE 
funds Year 2000 costs through operating cash flows.

     Estimates of time, cost and risk estimates are based on currently available 
information.  Developments that could affect estimates include, but are not 
limited to:  the availability and cost of trained personnel; the ability to 
locate and correct all relevant computer code and systems; cooperation and Year 
2000 readiness of our suppliers and customers (and their suppliers and 
customers); and the ability to correctly anticipate risks and implement suitable 
contingency plans in the event of system failures at NIKE or with our suppliers 
and customers (and their suppliers and customers).

     The above section, even if incorporated by reference into other documents 
or disclosures, is a Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure as defined under the Year 
2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act of 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's financial position remained strong at February 28, 1999.  
Compared to May 31, 1998 shareholder's equity remained fairly consistent at $3.3 
billion.  Working capital decreased 4% to $1.8 billion and the current ratio was 
2.10:1 at February 28, 1999 compared to 2.07:1 at May 31, 1998.

     Cash provided by operations increased $453 million compared to the first 
nine months of last year.   Working capital changes were the main reason for the 
increase, primarily the decrease in inventory levels.  Consolidated inventory 
levels at February 28, 1999 were 27% lower than last February and 18% lower than 
May 31, 1998.  In the current year the decrease in inventories was offset by a 
decrease in current payables and liabilities due to the slow down in spending 
and lower inventory levels.

     Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first nine months of 
fiscal 1999 were $265.4 million, the largest single component being expenditures 
related to the expansion of the Company's U.S. headquarters.  In addition, 
approx. $47 million has been expended for expansion of retail stores around the 
world.

     Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, 
together with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs.  
Significant short and long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks, 
which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity.  Liquidity 
is also provided by the Company's commercial paper program, under which there 
was $255.3 million outstanding at February 28, 1999.

     Dividends per share of common stock for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 
remained at $.12 per share, the same level as the previous year.

     As of February 28, 1999, the Company purchased a total of 8.0 million 
shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $318 million in the open market since 
the $1 billion share repurchase program was approved in December 1997.  During 
the first nine months of fiscal 1999, the Company purchased a total of 6.8 
million shares for $264 million.  Funding has, and is expected to continue to, 
come from operating cash flow in conjunction with short-term borrowings.  The 
timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working capital 
needs and stock market conditions.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
and Reports Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference 
from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other 
reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, 
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning 
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("the Act").  Forward-
looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, 
forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and 
may contain the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," 
"will be," "will continue," "will result," or words or phrases of similar 
meaning.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may 
cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  
The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by 
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among 
others, the following:  international, national and local general economic and 
market conditions (including the current Asian economic problems); the size and 
growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense 
competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic 
footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic 
changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, 
categories of products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE 
products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; fluctuations 
and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, 
the fact that advance "futures" orders may not be indicative of future revenues 
due to the changing mix of futures and at-once orders; the ability of NIKE to 
sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; new product development 
and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and 
other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer 
service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; 
dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions due to Year 2000 
noncompliance by NIKE, its suppliers or customers (or their suppliers or 
customers); increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery 
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks 
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without 
limitation, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic 
instability; changes in government regulations; liability and other claims 
asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and 
other reports.  

     The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this 
report may include additional factors which could adversely impact NIKE's 
business and financial performance.  Moreover, NIKE operates in a very 
competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from 
time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk 
factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's 
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may 
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not 
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual 
results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, 
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose 
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial 
information.  Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with 
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of 
the statement or report.  Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or 
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.  Thus, to the 
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, 
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
