       NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         __________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The year-end condensed
consolidated balance sheet data as of May 31, 2006 was derived from audited
financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The
interim financial information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction
with the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of
operations for the nine months ended February 28, 2007 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     On February 15, 2007 the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split of the Company's Class A and Class B common shares, which was
effected in the form of a 100% common stock dividend distributed on April 2,
2007.  All references in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to
share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the
two-for-one stock split.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in the Company's financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The provisions of FIN 48
are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FIN 48.

     In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 06-2, "Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other
Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43" ("EITF 06-2").  EITF 06-2
clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees' rights to
compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement.
The provisions of EITF 06-2 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June
1, 2007 and will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
earnings.  The Company has evaluated the provisions of EITF 06-2 and does not
expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No.
06-3, "How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus
Net Presentation)" ("EITF 06-3").  EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of the method
of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of assessed
taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under the gross
method.  EITF 06-3 is effective for the fourth quarter ending May 31, 2007;
however, since the Company presents revenues net of any taxes collected from
customers, no additional disclosures will be required.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.  The provisions of FAS 157 are
effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008.  The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("FAS 158"). FAS
158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with
single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other
postretirement plans in their financial statements.  The provisions of FAS 158
are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. The
Company has evaluated the provisions of FAS 158 and does not expect that the
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

     In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB 108").  SAB 108
requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and
income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement as material, when all relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered.  The guidance in SAB 108 is effective for
the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007.  The Company has evaluated the provisions
of SAB 108 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact
on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115" ("FAS 159").  FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  The
provisions of FAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1,
2008.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS
159.

NOTE 2 - Inventories:
         ___________

     Inventory balances of $2,167.8 million and $2,076.7 million at February
28, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively, were substantially all finished

NOTE 5 - Income Taxes:
         ____________

     The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended February
28, 2007 of 32.3% and 31.6%, respectively, has decreased from the full-year
fiscal 2006 effective tax rate of 35.0%.  The decrease is primarily due to a
European tax agreement entered into during the three months ended November 30,
2006 and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and development
tax credit signed into law in December 2006 as part of the Tax Relief and
Healthcare Act of 2006.  The Company recorded a retroactive benefit for both
the European tax agreement and the U.S. research and development tax credit

NOTE 7 - Stock-Based Compensation
         ________________________


     In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved,
the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1990 Plan"). The 1990 Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 132 million previously unissued shares of
Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted
under the plan.  The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses and
the issuance and sale of restricted stock. The exercise price for non-
statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights and the grant price of
restricted stock may not be less than 75% of the market price of the
underlying shares on the date of grant. The exercise price for incentive stock
options may not be less than the market price of the underlying shares on
the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990
Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom
awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and
conditions of the awards. The committee has granted substantially all stock
options and restricted stock at 100% of the market price on the date of grant.
Substantially all grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the
first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10
years from the date of grant.

     In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to
purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock
purchase plans ("ESPPs").  Employees are eligible to participate through
payroll deductions up to 10% of their compensation.  At the end of each six-
month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the ending of the offering
period.  In each of the nine months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006,
employees purchased 0.4 million shares.

     On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R "Share-Based Payment"
("FAS 123R") which requires the Company to record expense for stock-based
compensation to employees using a fair value method. Under FAS 123R, the
Company estimates the fair value of options granted under the 1990 Plan and
employees' purchase rights under the ESPPs using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model.  The Company recognizes this fair value as selling and
administrative expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method.

     The following table summarizes the effects of applying FAS 123R during
the three and nine months ended February 28, 2007. The resulting stock-based
compensation expense primarily relates to stock options.

1  In accordance with FAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense reported
during the three and nine months ended February 28, 2007, includes $0.3
million, net of tax, no effect per diluted share, and $23.9 million, net of
tax, or $0.04 per diluted share, respectively, of accelerated stock-based
compensation expense recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock
option vesting upon retirement. Because the Company usually grants the
majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of each
fiscal year, under FAS 123R, accelerated vesting will normally result in
higher expense in the first three months of the fiscal year.

</TABLE>

     As of February 28, 2007, the Company had $157.4 million of unrecognized
compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be
recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average
period of 2.4 years.

     The Company has adopted the modified prospective transition method
prescribed by FAS 123R, which does not require the restatement of financial
results for previous periods. In accordance with this transition method,
the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the
three and nine months ended February 28, 2007 include (1) amortization
of outstanding stock-based compensation granted prior to, but not vested, as
of June 1, 2006, based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
("FAS 123") and (2) amortization of all stock-based awards granted subsequent
to June 1, 2006, based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of FAS 123R.

     Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value
method to account for stock options and ESPP shares in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" as permitted by FAS 123. If the Company had instead
accounted for stock options and ESPP shares issued to employees using the fair
value method prescribed by FAS 123 during the three and nine months
ended February 28, 2006, the Company's pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share would have been reported as follows:

1  Accelerated stock-based compensation expense for options subject to
accelerated vesting due to employee retirement is not included in the pro
forma figures shown above for the three and nine months ended February
28, 2006.  This disclosure reflects the expense of such options ratably over
the stated vesting period or upon actual employee retirement.  Had the Company
recognized the fair value for such stock options on an accelerated basis in
this pro forma disclosure, the Company would have recognized less stock-based
compensation expense of $1.2 million, net of tax, no effect per diluted share,
for the three months ended February 28, 2006 and additional stock-based
compensation expense of $18.3 million, net of tax, or $0.04 per diluted share
for the nine months ended February 28, 2006.

     The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during
the nine months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006 as computed using the Black-
Scholes pricing model was $8.79 and $9.68, respectively.  The weighted average
assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows:

     Expected volatility is estimated based on the implied volatility in
market traded options on the Company's common stock with a term greater than
one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of
options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise
patterns.  The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity)
risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with
the expected term of the options.

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase an additional 9.2 million
and 11.2 million shares of common stock were outstanding for the three months

million shares of common stock were outstanding for the nine months ended
February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively, but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options were
antidilutive.

NOTE 9 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions for operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity excluding
NIKE Golf and NIKE Bauer Hockey.  Each NIKE brand geographic segment operates
predominantly in one industry:  the design, production, marketing and selling
of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. The "Other" category
shown below represents activities of Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, Converse
Inc., Exeter Brands Group LLC, Hurley International LLC, NIKE Bauer Hockey
Inc., and NIKE Golf, which are considered immaterial for individual disclosure
based on the aggregation criteria in SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information."

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents income before income taxes as shown in the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Reconciling items for pre-tax
income represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting including corporate activity, stock-based
compensation expense, certain currency exchange rate gains and losses on
transactions, and intercompany eliminations for specific income statement
items in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Accounts receivable, net, inventories, and property, plant and equipment,
net for operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided
below.

Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.




Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

     In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, revenues grew 9% to $3.9 billion,
net income grew 8% to $350.8 million and we delivered diluted earnings per
share of $0.68, a 10% increase versus the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
Included in our third quarter results is an after-tax charge of $17.8 million,
or approximately $0.04 per diluted share, related to stock-based compensation
expense now recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") No. 123R "Share-Based Payment" ("FAS 123R"), which we
adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

     Third quarter results were positively affected by a reduction in our
effective tax rate of 340 basis points as compared to the third quarter of
fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of the European tax agreement the Company
finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as well as the retroactive
reinstatement of the U.S. research and development tax credit signed into law
in December 2006.  Net income for the quarter was reduced by higher operating
overhead expenses versus the same period in the prior year, which was
attributable to higher investments in growth drivers such as emerging markets,
non-Nike brands and owned retail, as well as normal wage inflation and
performance based compensation. Our earnings per share for the quarter grew at
a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to
repurchases made under our share repurchase program.

     On a consolidated basis, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
increased revenues by 3 percentage points for the third quarter, and 2
percentage points for the first nine months of fiscal 2007.  Strong demand for
NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth for the quarter and
year-to-date period, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a
consolidated basis, all three of our product business units continued to
deliver revenue growth.  Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange
rates, our international regions contributed 3 percentage points to the
consolidated revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date periods.
Our Other businesses, comprised primarily of results from Cole Haan Holdings
Incorporated, Converse Inc., Exeter Brands Group LLC, Hurley International
LLC, NIKE Bauer Hockey, Inc., and NIKE Golf contributed 2 percentage points of
the consolidated constant-currency revenue growth for both the quarter and
year-to-date period and the US Region contributed the balance of revenue
growth.

     By product group, our worldwide equipment and apparel businesses reported
revenue growth of 13% and 9% for the third quarter, respectively, and combined,
added $113 million of incremental revenue.  Footwear grew 7% and contributed
$133 million of incremental revenue for the quarter.  For the first nine months
of fiscal 2007, our worldwide apparel and equipment businesses contributed $391
million of incremental revenue, while footwear contributed $344 million of
incremental revenue.

</TABLE>

For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the increase in gross margins versus the
prior year quarter was attributable to improved gross margins in our Other
businesses, driven primarily by Converse, favorable hedge results in the EMEA
and Asia Pacific regions, and better inventory management in our Asia Pacific
region, offset by sales discounts combined with a higher closeout mix in the
U.S. region.

For the year-to-date period, the primary factors contributing to the decrease
in gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows:

     (1)   Lower footwear net pricing margins due to sales discounts, combined
           with a higher closeout mix, primarily in the EMEA and U.S. regions;
           offset by

     (2)   Improved gross margins in our Other businesses, driven primarily by
           the growth in Converse's international licensing business, partially
           offset by the expected effects of the transition in Exeter's
           business model from licensing to wholesale;

     (3)   Favorable hedge results relative to the same period in the prior
           year, primarily in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions; and

     (4)   Lower obsolescence costs due to better inventory management, most
           notably in our Asia Pacific region.

    1 This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation
      for non-GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, this schedule is
      provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends
      excluding this identifiable expense by presenting our results for the
      third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2007 using the same
      accounting policy for stock-based compensation expense applied during the
      comparable prior year periods.

    2 This charge relates to stock-based compensation associated with stock
      options and ESPP shares issued to employees and expensed in accordance
      with FAS 123R.  We adopted FAS 123R on June 1, 2006 using the modified
      prospective transition method. While this expense was not reflected in
      our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of
      fiscal 2006, it will continue to be reflected in future accounting
      periods.

    3 Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including
      costs of endorsement contracts.

</TABLE>



     In the third quarter and year-to-date period, on a constant-currency
basis, demand creation expense increased 6% and 16%, respectively, versus the
same periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to
higher spending on advertising and brand events, most notably the Force
Basketball and Just Do It campaigns during the third quarter, combined with
investments in the global World Cup, NIKE Air (registered), NIKE Pro, LeBron,
American Football, and NIKE+ campaigns over the nine-month period. For the full
fiscal year 2007, growth in demand creation expense is expected to be more in
line with our revenue growth.

     Excluding stock-based compensation expense, on a constant-currency basis,
operating overhead increased 11% for the quarter and 7% for the year-to-date
period. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to the timing of
expenditures during the third quarter, and investments in growth drivers such
as emerging markets, non-Nike brands and owned retail, as well as normal wage
inflation and performance based compensation during both the third quarter and
year-to-date period.

</TABLE>


     Other income, net is comprised substantially of gains and losses
associated with the conversion of non-functional currency receivables and
payables, the re-measurement of foreign currency derivative instruments,
disposals of fixed assets, as well as other unusual or non-recurring
transactions that are outside the normal course of business.  For the third
quarter of fiscal 2007, Other income, net was primarily comprised of a $14.7
million gain on the sale of our Oregon footwear distribution center, partially
offset by foreign currency hedge losses. In the prior year quarter, foreign
currency hedge gains were the most significant component of Other income, net.

     The decrease in Other income, net for the first nine months of fiscal
2007 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of foreign currency
hedge losses in fiscal 2007, compared to foreign currency hedge gains in
fiscal 2006. The foreign currency hedge losses recognized in the first nine
months of fiscal 2007 were more than offset by the $14.2 million benefit from
the settlement of the Converse arbitration during the first quarter and the
$14.7 million gain on the sale of the Oregon footwear distribution center
discussed above. For our segment reporting, foreign currency hedge gains and
losses are reflected in the Corporate line, the gain on the sale of the
Oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the U.S. line, and the
Converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the Other line in our segment
presentation of pre-tax income in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 9 - Operating Segments).

</TABLE>


As disclosed in the second quarter, we finalized a European tax agreement that
is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. This agreement, combined with
the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and development tax credit
in December 2006, favorably impacted our third quarter and year-to-date
effective tax rates.  We estimate that our full year effective tax rate will
be consistent with the effective tax rate for the third quarter.


    Futures Orders

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel,
scheduled for delivery from March through July 2007, were 9% higher
than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2006.  This
futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual
exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period,
which approximate current spot rates.  The net effect of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates contributed approximately 1 percentage point to
futures growth versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this
currency impact, unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel
drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures
and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of
revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift
between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate
fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts
can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders,
and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not
derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and closeout sales
of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team
apparel, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey,
NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands.

</TABLE>

     For the third quarter, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was
attributable to mid-single digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a
decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was
driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products, including
boys and girls sport culture, men's sport performance, most notably running
due to the growth of our Nike+ performance product, and Brand Jordan
products. The decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the
prior year was the result of a change in mix in sport culture, as we
continue to expand our product offering, and a higher mix of off-price
product compared to the prior year, combined with growth in lower priced
kids' product.  For the year-to-date period, U.S. footwear revenue growth
reflected an increase in both unit sales and average selling price per pair,
driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture, running, and Brand
Jordan products.

     The growth in U.S. apparel revenues for the third quarter reflected
stable pricing combined with an increase in unit sales, driven by growth in
Brand Jordan products.  For the year-to-date period, U.S. apparel revenue
growth was attributable to higher unit sales, most notably NIKE brand sport
performance apparel, combined with an improvement in average selling prices,
driven by team and licensed apparel and Brand Jordan products.

     Pre-tax income for the U.S. region was down slightly for the third
quarter and year-to-date period, versus the comparable prior year periods, as
higher selling and administrative expenses and lower gross margins offset the
growth in revenues.  For the quarter, the gross margin decline was primarily
attributable to sales discounts combined with a higher level of closeouts than
the prior year quarter.

     For the year-to-date period, lower gross margins resulted from additional
logistics costs incurred to meet footwear unit demand, increasing footwear
product costs, and higher sales incentives.  Selling and administrative
expenses increased for the quarter and first nine months of the fiscal year as
a result of higher demand creation spending around the Force Basketball
campaign during the third quarter, combined with increased spend around the
World Cup, Nike Air (registered), LeBron, American Football and Nike+
campaigns in the first six months of fiscal 2007.  The growth in demand
creation spend versus the comparable prior year periods is also a function of
the difference in timing of major advertising campaigns during fiscal 2007
versus fiscal 2006. Operating overhead increased during the third quarter and
year-to-date period due primarily to normal wage inflation, performance-based
compensation and higher headcount due to retail growth.

</TABLE>

     For the EMEA region, which includes Europe, Middle East and Africa,
changes in currency exchange rates contributed 9 percentage points and 5
percentage points of the revenue growth for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal 2007, respectively. Excluding changes in currency exchange
rates, all markets within the region, with the exception of the U.K. and
France, increased revenues during the quarter and year-to-date period. The
emerging markets in the region grew over 30% for both the quarter and year-to-
date period, driven by strong results in Russia, South Africa and Turkey.
Increases in Northern Europe, Italy and Spain also contributed significantly
to the revenue growth in both the third quarter and year-to-date period.

     Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 4
percentage points during the third quarter and decreased 1 percentage point
for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 compared to the same periods in the
prior year.  The increase in the third quarter was primarily driven by
increased unit sales of sport culture products. For the first nine months of
fiscal 2007, the slight decrease in footwear revenues was attributable to
decreased unit sales, resulting from the challenging retail environment in
the U.K. and France, partially offset by increased demand for sport culture
products across the rest of the region.

     The increase in EMEA apparel revenue during the third quarter and
first nine months of fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased unit sales of
NIKE brand apparel, primarily sport culture, soccer and sport performance
products.

     The increase in EMEA pre-tax income for the third quarter of fiscal
2007 compared to the same period in the prior year reflected higher unit
sales, stable gross margins and a decrease in demand creation spending
combined with favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by an
increase in operating overhead. The decline in EMEA pre-tax income for the
first nine months of fiscal 2007 reflected a lower gross margin percentage
and higher selling and administrative expenses, which more than offset the
increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation compared to
the prior year period.  The lower gross margin percentage for the year-to-
date period was attributable to lower in-line net pricing margins in
footwear combined with an increase in warehousing costs. The lower in-line
net pricing margins in footwear were attributable to sales discounts,
particularly in the U.K. and France, and a shift in product mix, combined
with strategies to improve consumer value.

     Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, selling and
administrative expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007
were higher than the corresponding periods in the prior year.  Operating
overhead expense was higher in the third quarter and year-to-date period due
primarily to expected annual increases in wages and benefits, and higher
samples cost. For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, the increase in
demand creation spending versus the prior year was primarily due to
investments in the World Cup, Nike Air (registered), Nike Pro and Nike+
campaigns.

</TABLE>

     In the Asia Pacific region, changes in currency exchange rates
contributed 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point of revenue growth for
the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively. The majority of
countries within the region reported double-digit sales increases for both the
quarter and year-to-date period. China continues to be the primary driver of
growth within the region, as revenues increased 20% for the quarter and 27%
for the year-to-date period on a constant currency basis due to expansion in
both the number of stores selling Nike product and the sales through existing
doors.  While revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was strong, revenue
in Japan decreased 3% for the quarter and remained flat year-to-date. Despite
sustained softness in this market, we are starting to see positive signs,
including higher gross margins, improvements in sell through at retail
and improving futures order trends.

     Footwear revenue growth for both the quarter and first nine months of
fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China and Korea,
partially offset by lower average selling prices, which primarily resulted
from strategies to improve consumer value in Japan combined with a change in
the mix of products sold across the region. The increase in apparel revenue
for both the quarter and year-to-date period was also primarily driven by
increased demand in China and Korea.

     The increase in pre-tax income in the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross
margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset
higher selling and administrative expenses.  The gross margin improvement
for the quarter and first nine months of the fiscal year was primarily
driven by better inventory management, improved year-over-year hedge rates
and reduced warehousing costs.  The improvement in margins was partially
offset by higher sales incentives combined with efforts to improve consumer
value, most notably in Japan.  The increase in selling and administrative
expenses during the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2007
was primarily attributable to demand creation investments.  In the third
quarter, the increase was driven primarily by the Just Do It and Force
Basketball campaigns. For the first nine months of fiscal 2007 the increase
was driven by the third quarter events noted above, as well as demand
creation investments in the LeBron campaign, the Just Do It campaign in
China, the launch of Nike+ in Japan and increased spend around the World
Cup.  Overall business growth across the region, combined with retail
expansion in China also contributed to an increase in operating overhead
expenses.

</TABLE>

     In the Americas region, changes in currency exchange rates did not have
a significant impact on reported revenue growth for the third quarter and
contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for the first nine months
of fiscal 2007.  Excluding the changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
double-digit revenue growth in most markets within the region during the
third quarter and year-to-date period more than offset softer results in
Brazil.

     The increase in pre-tax income for both the third quarter and first
nine months of fiscal 2007 versus the comparable prior year periods, was
primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins. These
factors were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses
for both the quarter and year-to-date period.

</TABLE>

     The increase in Other business revenues for the third quarter was
driven by higher revenues at NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, while year-to-
date revenue growth was driven by higher revenues across all businesses,
most notably NIKE Golf, Converse, NIKE Bauer Hockey and Exeter Brands Group.

     During the third quarter and year-to-date period, growth at NIKE Golf
and NIKE Bauer Hockey, most notably during the first six months of fiscal
2007, combined with improved profitability at Converse, driven by increased
revenues in the United States and internationally, contributed to the
increase in pre-tax income versus the same periods in the prior year.  As
previously discussed, the year-to-date results include the benefit from the
$14.2 million favorable settlement of the arbitration ruling involving
Converse and a former South American licensee.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Activity

     Cash provided by operations was $914.8 million for the first nine months
of fiscal 2007, compared to $953.1 million for the first nine months of
fiscal 2006. Our primary source of operating cash flow for the first nine
months of 2007 was net income of $1,053.6 million offset by investments in
working capital to support growth in the business.  The increased investment
in working capital during the first nine months of fiscal 2007 was largely
due to a decrease in accounts payable and corresponding increase in
inventory related to the timing of payments and inventory receipts versus
the same period in the prior year.

     Cash provided by investing activities was $778.0 million for the first
nine months of fiscal 2007, compared to cash used in investing activities of
$355.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2006.  The increase over
fiscal 2006 was primarily due to higher net maturities of short-term
investments (maturities net of purchases) as we liquidated short-term
investments for share repurchases.

     Cash used in financing activities was $794.7 million for the first nine
months of fiscal 2007, compared to $521.0 million used in the first nine
months of fiscal 2006.  The increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to
the $250 million repayment of corporate bonds, combined with an increase in
share repurchases, as discussed below.

     In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we purchased 1.8 million shares of
NIKE's Class B common stock for $91.3 million, bringing total purchases for
the first nine months of fiscal 2007 to 16.8 million shares at a cost of
$694.0 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we repurchased 12
million shares, of which 4 million shares completed the previous four-year,
$1.5 million share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in
June 2004. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we have now
repurchased 12.8 million shares for $531.4 million under the new $3 billion
program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. We expect to fund
share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The
timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital
needs and stock market conditions.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock for the third quarter of
fiscal 2007 were $0.185, compared to $0.155 in the third quarter of fiscal
2006.

</TABLE>

     The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate
amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are
obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual
payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these
contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon
athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods.
Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts
include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in
future periods.

     In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the
endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine
how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis, as the contracts
do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product, and
as a result, such amounts are not included in the table above. The amount of
product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including
general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they
participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing
initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase
the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time
and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for
products sold to customers.

Capital Resources

     On December 1, 2006, the Company entered into a $1 billion multi-year
credit facility that replaces the Company's previous $750 million facility.
The new revolving credit facility has similar terms to the previous facility
and matures in December 2011, with a one year extension option prior to each
of the first anniversary and second anniversary of the closing date, for a
total extension of two years. No amounts were outstanding under these
facilities at May 31, 2006 or February 28, 2007.

     On January 12, 2007, one of the Company's Japanese subsidiaries entered
into a 3 billion Yen (approximately $25.6 million) loan facility that
replaces certain intercompany borrowings. The interest rate on the facility
is based on the six-month Japanese Yen London Interbank Offer Rate (JPY
LIBOR) plus a spread, currently 0.805%. The facility expires December 31,
2007 unless both parties agree to an extension.

     On February 14, 2007, the Company's same Japanese subsidiary entered into
a 5 billion Yen (approximately $41.5 million) term loan maturing February 14,
2012 that replaces certain intercompany borrowings. The interest rate on the
loan is 1.52125% and interest is paid semi-annually.

     Our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings remain at A+ and A2 from
Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was no amount outstanding at February 28, 2007 or May 31, 2006. We
currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above and in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, will be
sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable
future.


Recently Issued Accounting Standards

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The provisions of FIN 48 are effective
for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the
impact of the provisions of FIN 48.

     In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 06-2, "Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other
Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43" ("EITF 06-2"). EITF 06-2
clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees' rights to
compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement.
The provisions of EITF 06-2 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June
1, 2007 and will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
earnings.  We have evaluated the provisions of EITF 06-2 and do not expect
that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

     In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No.
06-3, "How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross
versus Net Presentation)" ("EITF 06-3").  EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of
the method of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of
assessed taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under
the gross method.  EITF 06-3 is effective for the fourth quarter ending May
31, 2007; however, since we present revenues net of any taxes collected from
customers, no additional disclosures will be required.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The
provisions of FAS 157 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1,
2008.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. "Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("FAS 158").
FAS 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated
with single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other
postretirement plans in their financial statements.  The provisions of FAS
158 are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. We
have evaluated the provisions of FAS 158 and do not expect that the adoption
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

     In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB 108").  SAB 108
requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and
income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement as material, when all relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered.  The guidance in SAB 108 is effective for
the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007.  We are currently evaluating the
impact of SAB 108.

     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 115" ("FAS 159"). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
The provisions of FAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June
1, 2008.  We have evaluated the provisions of SAB 108 and do not expect that
the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.


Critical Accounting Policies


     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America . The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in
the accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on
our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. With the adoption of FAS 123R at the beginning of the first
quarter of fiscal 2007, we have added "Stock-based Compensation" as a
critical accounting policy as described below.  Actual results could differ
from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent
payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make
estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date.
However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results
related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period
following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally
affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.

     Stock-based Compensation

     As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R,
the fair value of stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes fair value model. The Black-Scholes option pricing
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in
market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than
one year, along with other factors.  Our decision to use implied volatility
was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock
and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future
stock price trends than historical volatility.  If factors change and we use
different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in
future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the
future from that recorded in the current period.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2006.

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-
benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

     We carry out a variety of on-going procedures under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level as of February 28, 2007.

     There has been no change in our internal controls over financial
reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over
financial reporting.


               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                             and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements
include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast,
indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and may
contain the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project,"
"will be," "will continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in
reports filed by NIKE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including
Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among others, the following:
international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the
size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment
markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and
sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and
endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of
particular designs, categories of products, and sports; seasonal and
geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or
forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE
products, and the various market factors described above; difficulties in
implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's increasingly complex
information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems
related to demand and supply planning, and inventory control; fluctuations and
difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation,
the fact that advance "futures" orders may not be indicative of future
revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-once orders; the ability of
NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size,
timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new product development and
introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other
intellectual property performance and reliability of products; customer
service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers;
dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight
and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or
development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the
United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations,
import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes
in government regulations; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE;
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors
referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

                     COMMERCIAL PAPER DEALER AGREEMENT


     This agreement (the "Agreement") sets forth the understanding
between the Issuer and the Dealer, each named on the cover page of this
Agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer of
its short-term promissory notes (the "Notes") through the Dealer.

     Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 of
this Agreement.

     The Addendum and Exhibits to this Agreement are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and made fully a part hereof.


Section 1.    Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes.

     1.1     While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to
sell the Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any
sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer
has and shall have no obligation to purchase the Notes from the Issuer
or to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, the
parties hereto agree that in any case where the Dealer purchases Notes
from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the Issuer, such
Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer
contained herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and
conditions and in the manner provided herein.

     1.2     So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in
addition to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer
shall not, without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept
offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with
one or more dealers which may from time to time after the date hereof
become dealers with respect to the Notes by executing with the Issuer
one or more agreements which contain provisions substantially identical
to those contained in Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer
hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in
transactions with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto,
which are executing agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions
substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement
contemporaneously herewith.  In no event shall the Issuer offer,
solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly on
its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers
as specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.

     1.3     The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination of $250,000
or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will bear such
interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount
from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and the
Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 364 days from the date of
issuance and may have such terms as are specified in Exhibit C hereto
or the Private Placement Memorandum.   The Notes shall not contain any
provision for extension, renewal or automatic "rollover."

     1.4     The authentication and issuance of, and payment for, the
Notes shall be effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent
Agreement, and the Notes shall be either individual physical
certificates or book-entry notes evidenced by one or more master notes
(each, a "Master Note") registered in the name of The Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") or its nominee, in the form or forms annexed to the
Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

     1.5     If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of
the purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged
by the Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to
the date of issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and
interest rate or interest rate index and margin (in the case of

                                  1

<PAGE>

interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes
issued on a discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the
Dealer's services hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer
shall cause such Note to be issued and delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement and payment for such
Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof, either directly or through
the Dealer, to the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the account of the
Issuer.  Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is
expressly acting as an agent for the Issuer and a purchaser shall
either fail to accept delivery of or make payment for a Note on the
date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly notify the Issuer,
and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the Note, the
Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer against its return
of the Note to the Issuer, in the case of a certificated Note, and upon
notice of such failure in the case of a book-entry Note.  If such
failure occurred for any reason other than default by the Dealer, the
Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer on an equitable basis for the
Dealer's loss of the use of such funds for the period such funds were
credited to the Issuer's account, but only for the period after the
Note is returned to the Issuer or the Issuer is so notified.

     1.6     The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to
observe the following procedures in connection with offers, sales and
subsequent resales or other transfers of the Notes:

     (a)   Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall
be made only to: (i) investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be
Qualified Institutional Buyers, Institutional Accredited Investors or
Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investors and (ii) non-bank
fiduciaries or agents that will be purchasing Notes for one or more
accounts, each of which is reasonably believed by the Dealer to be an
Institutional Accredited Investor or Sophisticated Individual
Accredited Investor.

     (b)   Resales and other transfers of the Notes by the holders
thereof shall be made only in accordance with the restrictions in the
legend described in clause (e) below.

     (c)   No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used
in connection with the offering of the Notes.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of the
Dealer, the Issuer shall not issue any press release or place or
publish any "tombstone" or other advertisement relating to the Notes.

     (d)   No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than
$250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a
smaller principal or face amount.  If the purchaser is a non-bank
fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such
purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face
amount of Notes.

     (e)   Offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer through the
Dealer acting as agent for the Issuer shall be made in accordance with
Rule 506 under the Securities Act, and shall be subject to the
restrictions described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto.  A
legend substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as
part of the Private Placement Memorandum used in connection with offers
and sales of Notes hereunder, as well as on each individual certificate
representing a Note and each Master Note representing book-entry Notes
offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement.

     (f)   The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each
purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the
then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has
previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then
in effect.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that
any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask
questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer

                                    2
<PAGE>

and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.

     (g)   The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of
the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes
that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at
its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of
Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with
Rule 144A(d).

     (h)   In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by the
Dealer would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall
immediately notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of
such fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Dealer an
amendment or supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing
the Notes that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and
any other relevant information relating thereto.

     (i)   The Issuer represents that it is not currently issuing
commercial paper in the United States market in reliance upon the
exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Issuer
agrees that, if it shall issue commercial paper after the date hereof
in reliance upon such exemption (a) the proceeds from the sale of the
Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such
commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer
will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the
offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section
3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes
hereunder; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements
of Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act in selling commercial paper or
other short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United
States.

     (j)   The Issuer hereby agrees that, not later than 15 days after
the first sale of Notes as contemplated by this Agreement, it will file
with the SEC a notice on Form D in accordance with Rule 503 under the
Securities Act and that it will thereafter file such amendments to such
notice as Rule 503 may require.

     1.7     The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer,
in connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:

     (a)   The Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as
permitted by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither
the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers
referred to in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has
offered or sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the
Issuer (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the
Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from, any
person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in
Section 1.2 hereof.  The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted
by Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by
the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as
contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of
Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person
other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2
hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) will offer the
Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to,
or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than
the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof, it
being understood that such agreement is made with a view to bringing
the offer and sale of the Notes within the exemption provided by
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 thereunder and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Issuer hereby
represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to take, and

                                    3

<PAGE>

will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause the offering
and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any other offering of
securities, whether such offering is made by the Issuer or some other
party or parties.

     (b)   The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the
sale of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the
purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of
Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In the event that the Issuer
determines to use such proceeds for the purpose of buying, carrying or
trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of
another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least
five business days' prior written notice to that effect.  The Issuer
shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it
commences to purchase securities with the proceeds of the Notes.
Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal
and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the
extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations
thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes either (i) only to offerees
it reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to
Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for
other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with
Rule 144A or (ii) in a manner which would not cause a violation of
Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder.

Section 2.    Representations and Warranties of Issuer.

     The Issuer represents and warrants that:

     2.1     The Issuer is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
has all the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Notes, this Agreement and the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.2     This Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement
have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer
enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.3     The Notes have been duly authorized, and when issued as
provided in the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, and when the
consideration therefor is received by the Issuer, will be duly and
validly issued and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.4     The offer and sale of the Notes in the manner contemplated
hereby do not require registration of the Notes under the Securities
Act, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section
4(2) thereof and Regulation D thereunder, and no indenture in respect
of the Notes is required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended.

     2.5     The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer.

     2.6     Except as provided in Section 1.6(j) hereof,  no consent
or action of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or
public regulatory body or authority, including the SEC, is required to
                                  4

delivery or performance of, this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement, except as may be required by the securities
or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and
sale of the Notes.

     2.7     Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the issuance of the Notes
in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the
fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof by the Issuer, will (i) result in the creation or imposition of
any mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon
any of the properties or assets of the Issuer, or (ii) violate or
result in a breach or a default under any of the terms of the Issuer's
charter documents or by-laws, any contract or instrument to which the
Issuer is a party or by which it or its property is bound, or any law
or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
government instrumentality, to which the Issuer is subject or by which
it or its property is bound, which breach or default would have a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
operations or business prospects of the Issuer or the ability of the
Issuer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.8     There is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending,
or to the knowledge of the Issuer threatened, against or affecting the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries which would result in a material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), operations or
business prospects of the Issuer or the ability of the Issuer to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.9     The Issuer is not an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     2.10    Neither the Private Placement Memorandum nor the Company
Information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

     2.11    Each (a) issuance of Notes by the Issuer hereunder and (b)
amendment or supplement of the Private Placement Memorandum shall be
deemed a representation and warranty by the Issuer to the Dealer, as of
the date thereof, that, both before and after giving effect to such
issuance and after giving effect to such amendment or supplement, (i)
the representations and warranties given by the Issuer set forth in
this Section 2 remain true and correct on and as of such date as if
made on and as of such date, (ii) in the case of an issuance of Notes,
the Notes being issued on such date have been duly and validly issued
and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer,
enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) in the case of an
issuance of Notes, since the date of the most recent Private Placement
Memorandum, there has been no material adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or business prospects of the
Issuer which has not been disclosed to the Dealer in writing.

any such amendment, modification or waiver.

     3.2.     The Issuer shall, whenever there shall occur any material
change in the Issuer's condition (financial or otherwise), operations

notice of intended or potential downgrading or any review for potential
change in the rating accorded any of the Issuer's securities by any
nationally recognized statistical rating organization which has
published a rating of the Notes), promptly, and in any event prior to
any subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder, notify the Dealer (by
telephone, confirmed in writing) of such change, development or
occurrence.

     3.3.     The Issuer shall from time to time furnish to the Dealer
such information as the Dealer may reasonably request, including,
without limitation, any press releases or material provided by the
Issuer to any national securities exchange or rating agency, regarding

authorization and execution of the Notes and (iii) the Issuer's ability
to pay the Notes as they mature.

     3.4.     The Issuer will take all such action as the Dealer may

that the Issuer shall not be obligated to file any general consent to
service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or subject itself to
taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not otherwise so subject.

     3.5.     The Issuer will not be in default of any of its material
obligations hereunder, under the Notes or under the Issuing and Paying

review, and the Issuer approves of the Private Placement Memorandum in
writing.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall contain a statement

                                   6

<PAGE>

questions of, and receive answers from, the Issuer concerning the
offering of Notes and to obtain relevant additional information which
the Issuer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or
expense.

     4.2.     The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the
Company Information as it becomes available. The Issuer shall be deemed
to have furnished Company Information when such information has been
posted on the Internet website of the Securities and Exchange

previously identified to the Dealer or if the Dealer or its affiliate
shall have been furnished such information pursuant to other
contractual arrangements with the Issuer.

     4.3.     (a)  The Issuer further agrees to notify the Dealer
promptly upon the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the
Issuer that would cause the Company Information then in existence to
include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

     (b)   In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it
then has Notes it is holding in inventory, the Issuer agrees promptly
to supplement or amend the Private Placement Memorandum so that the
Private Placement Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
and the Issuer shall make such supplement or amendment available to the
Dealer.

     (c)   In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer
that it is then holding Notes in inventory and (iii) the Issuer chooses
not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in
the manner described in clause (b) above, then all solicitations and
sales of Notes shall be suspended until such time as the Issuer has so
amended or supplemented the Private Placement Memorandum, and made such
amendment or supplement available to the Dealer.

     (d)   Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), the
Issuer shall review, amend and supplement the Private Placement
Memorandum on a periodic basis, but no less than at least once annually,
to incorporate current financial information of the Issuer to the
extent necessary to ensure that the information provided in the Private
Placement Memorandum is accurate and complete.

Section 5.    Indemnification and Contribution.

     5.1    The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer,
each individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other
entity controlling the Dealer, any affiliate of the Dealer or any such
controlling entity and their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, incorporators, shareholders, servants, trustees and agents
(hereinafter the "Indemnitees") against any and all liabilities,
penalties, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, claims, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel) or judgments of whatever kind or nature (each a "Claim"),
imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees arising
out of or based upon (i) any allegation that the Private Placement
Memorandum (provided that prior to any distribution by the Dealer, the
Dealer shall have submitted the Private Placement Memorandum to the
Issuer for review, and the Issuer shall have approved of the Private
Placement Memorandum in writing), the Company Information or any
information provided by the Issuer to the Dealer included (as of any
relevant time) or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted (as of any relevant time) or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) arising out of or

                                 7

<PAGE>

based upon the breach by the Issuer of any agreement, covenant or
representation made in or pursuant to this Agreement.  This
indemnification shall not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out
of or is based upon Dealer Information or the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Dealer in the performance of, or the failure
to perform, its obligations under this Agreement.

     5.2    Provisions relating to claims made for indemnification
under this Section 5 are set forth on Exhibit B to this Agreement.

     5.3    In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section
5 is held to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the
Indemnitees, although applicable in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5, the Issuer shall contribute to the aggregate costs incurred
by the Dealer in connection with any Claim in the proportion of the
respective economic interests of the Issuer and the Dealer; provided,
however, that such contribution by the Issuer shall be in an amount
such that the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer do not exceed the
aggregate of the commissions and fees earned by the Dealer hereunder
with respect to the issue or issues of Notes to which such Claim
relates.  The respective economic interests shall be calculated by
reference to the aggregate proceeds to the Issuer of the Notes issued
hereunder and the aggregate commissions and fees earned by the Dealer
hereunder.

of any of the Issuer's debt securities.

                             Exhibit B
             Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification

(a)  The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all expenses
     (including reasonable fees and disbursements of internal and
     external counsel) as they are incurred by it in connection with
     investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or
     action in respect of which indemnification may be sought under
     Section 5 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to any
     such proceedings) provided, however, that if it is found in any
     such action, proceeding or investigation that any loss, claim,
     damage or liability of an Indemnitee has resulted from the Dealer
     Information or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
     Indemnitee in performing the services that are the subject of this
     Agreement, the Indemnitee shall repay such portion of the
     reimbursed amounts that is attributable to expenses incurred in
     relation to the act or omission of the Indemnitee which is the
     subject of such finding.

(b)  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence
     of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is
     to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the
     existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the
     Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may
     have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not
     otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the
     forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and
     (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from
     liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on
     account of this indemnity agreement.  In case any such Claim is
     made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the
     existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate
     therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice
     delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the control and defense
     thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee;
     provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the
     Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded
     that there may be legal defenses available to it which are
     materially different from or additional to those available to the
     Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense
     of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee
     shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
     legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.  Upon receipt of
     notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer's election
     so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the
     Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such
     Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in
     connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs
     of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed
     separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal
     defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding
     sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not
     be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in
     addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any
     Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the
     Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not
     have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to
     represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of
     existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in
     writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee.  The
     indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the
     Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the
     Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding
     upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs
     and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee.
     The Issuer agrees that without the Dealer's prior written consent
     (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), it will not settle,
     compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in
     respect of which indemnification may be sought under the
     indemnification provision of the Agreement (whether or not the
     Dealer or any other Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to
     such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i)
     includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all
     liability arising out of such Claim and (ii) does not include a
     statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure
     to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee.

                             Exhibit C
   Statement of Terms for Interest - Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of
                            NIKE, Inc.


THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC [PRICING] [PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM]
SUPPLEMENT (THE "SUPPLEMENT") (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE
TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

1.  General.  (a)  The obligations of the Issuer to which these terms
apply (each a "Note") are represented by one or more Master Notes (each,
a "Master Note") issued in the name of (or of a nominee for) The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), which Master Note includes the terms
and provisions for the Issuer's Interest-Bearing Commercial Paper Notes
that are set forth in this Statement of Terms, since this Statement of
Terms constitutes an integral part of the Underlying Records as defined
and referred to in the Master Note.

(b)  "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that
is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are
authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be
closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined
below) is also a London Business Day.  "London Business Day" means, a
day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in
U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.

2.  Interest.  (a)  Each Note will bear interest at a fixed rate (a
"Fixed Rate Note") or at a floating rate (a "Floating Rate Note").

(b)  The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the
following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a
Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount
Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be
issued (the "Issue Date"); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined
below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at
which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment
Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the
Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates
and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below),
and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating
the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable
specifically to such Note.  "Original Issue Discount Note" means a Note
which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that
exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and
which the Supplement indicates will be an "Original Issue Discount
Note".

(c)  Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the
rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount
thereof is paid or made available for payment.  Interest on each Fixed
Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement
(each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the
Maturity Date (as defined below).  Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of
principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the next
succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in
respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.
(d)  The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest
Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an
interest rate basis (a "Base Rate") plus or minus a number of basis
points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point)
(the "Spread"), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the
"Spread Multiplier"), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or
made available for payment.  The Supplement will designate which of the
following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note:
(a) the CD Rate (a "CD Rate Note"), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a
"Commercial Paper Rate Note"), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a "Federal
Funds Rate Note"), (d) LIBOR (a "LIBOR Note"), (e) the Prime Rate (a
"Prime Rate Note"), (f) the Treasury Rate (a "Treasury Rate Note") or
(g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily,
weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the "Interest Reset
Period").  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an
"Interest Reset Date") will be, unless otherwise specified in the
Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each
Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury
Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case
of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in
the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday
of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly,
the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the
case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third
Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any
Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day,
such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a
Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business
Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date
shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each
Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually
(the "Interest Payment Period") and on the Maturity Date.  Unless
otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below,
the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an "Interest
Payment Date" for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of
Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the
third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with
a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March,
June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes
with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of
the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity
Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.

If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an
Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise
be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall
be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the
case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately
preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and
interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no
interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after
such maturity.

Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes
will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from
and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid,
as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On
the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will
include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued
interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a
Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued
interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors
calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is
being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for
each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable
to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate,
Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by
the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate
is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be
(i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with
respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below)
pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an
Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest
Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date,
subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread
Multiplier.

The "Interest Determination Date" where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or
the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next
preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date
where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be
the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest
Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second
London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The
Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate
will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls
when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are
normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a
legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following
Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the
preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date
pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding
week.

The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or
obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.

The "Calculation Date," where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i)
the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination
Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment
Date or Maturity Date.

All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless
otherwise specified.

The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent
which party will be the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent")
with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will
provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the
interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset
Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying
Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate
Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in
such interest rate.

All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes
will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.
For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655%
(or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any
calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S.
dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to
the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).

CD Rate Notes

"CD Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for
negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as
published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"FRB") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or
any successor publication of the FRB ("H.15(519)") under the heading
"CDs (Secondary Market)".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest
Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519),
available through the world wide website of the FRB at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor
site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the
purpose of displaying the applicable rate ("H.15 Daily Update") under
the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)".

If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update
by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will
determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of
three leading nonbank dealers1 in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates
of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for
negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States
money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for
negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to
the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set
forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such
Interest Determination Date.

Commercial Paper Rate Notes

"Commercial Paper Rate" means the Money Market Yield (calculated as
described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519)
under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money
Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily
Update under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in
either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will
determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the
arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest
Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial
paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial
paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond
rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such
Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then
in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" will be a yield calculated in accordance with the
following formula:

                         D x 360
Money Market Yield = _______________ x 100
                      360 - (D x M)

1  Such nonblank dealers referred to in this Statement of Terms may include
    affiliates of the Dealer.

<PAGE>

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "M"
refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which
interest is being calculated.

Federal Funds Rate Notes

"Federal Funds Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date
for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal
Funds (Effective)" and displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any
successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the
specified page on that service) ("Telerate Page 120").

If the above rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not so
published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate
will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in
H.15 Daily Update under the heading "Federal Funds/(Effective)".

If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal
Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last
transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of
three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City
selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest
Determination Date.

If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds
Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

LIBOR Notes

The London Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") means, with respect to any
Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars
having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as
of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.

If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates
at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest
Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to
prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such
market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index
Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the
Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a single transaction
in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a "Representative Amount").
The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each
of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such
quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such
interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at
approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by
the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European
banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative
Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected
by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then
existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment
Period.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means the display designated as page "3750" on
Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on
that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by

<PAGE>

the British Bankers' Association for the purposes of displaying London
interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).

Prime Rate Notes

"Prime Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as
published in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on
the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such
Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite
the caption "Bank Prime Loan".

If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date
in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent
will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of
interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters
Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or
base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.

If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by
3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine
the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base
lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the
year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by
the Calculation Agent.

If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime
Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest
Determination Date.

"Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page" means the display designated as page
"US PRIME1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other
page as may replace the US PRIME1 page on that service for the purpose
of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States
banks).

Treasury Rate Notes

"Treasury Rate" means:

(1) the rate from the auction held on the Interest Determination Date
(the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury
Bills") having the Index Maturity specified in the Supplement under the
caption "INVESTMENT RATE" on the display on Moneyline Telerate (or any
successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace that
page on that service) ("Telerate Page 56") or page 57 (or any other
page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 57"), or

(2) if the rate referred to in clause (1) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as
defined below) of the rate for the applicable Treasury Bills as
published in H.15 Daily Update, under the caption "U.S. Government
Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High", or

(3) if the rate referred to in clause (2) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield of the
auction rate of the applicable Treasury Bills as announced by the
United States Department of the Treasury, or

(4) if the rate referred to in clause (3) is not so announced by the
United States Department of the Treasury, or if the  Auction is not
held, the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on the particular Interest
Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Bills as published in
H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury
Bills/Secondary Market", or

(5) if the rate referred to in clause (4) not so published by 3:00 p.m.
on the related Calculation Date, the rate on the particular Interest
Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Bills as published in
H.15 Daily Update, under the caption "U.S. Government
Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market", or

(6) if the rate referred to in clause (5) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the rate on the particular
Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent as the
Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m. on that Interest Determination
Date, of three primary United States government securities dealers
selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with
a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the
Supplement, or

(7) if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting
as mentioned in clause (6), the Treasury Rate in effect on the
particular Interest Determination Date.

"Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage)
calculated in accordance with the following formula:


                            D x N
Bond Equivalent Yield = _____________ x 100
                        360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers
to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number
of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.

3.   Final Maturity.  The Stated Maturity Date for any Note will be the
date so specified in the Supplement, which shall be no later than 364
days from the date of issuance.  On its Stated Maturity Date, or any
date prior to the Stated Maturity Date on which the particular Note
becomes due and payable by the declaration of acceleration, each such
date being referred to as a Maturity Date, the principal amount of each
Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be
immediately due and payable.

4.   Events of Default.  The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to a Note:  (i) default
in any payment of principal of or interest on such Note (including on a
redemption thereof); (ii) the Issuer makes any compromise arrangement
with its creditors generally including the entering into any form of
moratorium with its creditors generally; (iii) a court having
jurisdiction shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the
Issuer in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or there
shall be appointed a receiver, administrator, liquidator, custodian,
trustee or sequestrator (or similar officer) with respect to the whole
or substantially the whole of the assets of the Issuer and any such
decree, order or appointment is not removed, discharged or withdrawn
within 60 days thereafter; or (iv) the Issuer shall commence a
voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an
order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent
to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, administrator,
liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar
official), with respect to the whole or substantially the whole of the
assets of the Issuer or make any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the principal
of each obligation evidenced by such Note (together with interest
accrued and unpaid thereon) shall become, without any notice or demand,
immediately due and payable.2

5.    Obligation Absolute.  No provision of the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement under which the Notes are issued shall alter or impair
the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to
pay the principal of and interest on each Note at the times, place and
rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

6.    Supplement.  Any term contained in the Supplement shall supercede
any conflicting term contained herein.






2  Unlike single payment notes, where a default arises only at the stated
  maturity, interest-bearing notes with multiple payment dates should
  contain a default provision permitting acceleration of the maturity
  if the Issuer defaults on an interest payment.

                     COMMERCIAL PAPER DEALER AGREEMENT


     This agreement (the "Agreement") sets forth the understanding
between the Issuer and the Dealer, each named on the cover page of this
Agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer of
its short-term promissory notes (the "Notes") through the Dealer.

     Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 of
this Agreement.

     The Addendum and Exhibits to this Agreement are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and made fully a part hereof.


Section 1.    Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes.

     1.1     While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to
sell the Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any
sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer
has and shall have no obligation to purchase the Notes from the Issuer
or to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, the
parties hereto agree that in any case where the Dealer purchases Notes
from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the Issuer, such
Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer
contained herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and
conditions and in the manner provided herein.

     1.2     So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in
addition to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer
shall not, without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept
offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with
one or more dealers which may from time to time after the date hereof
become dealers with respect to the Notes by executing with the Issuer
one or more agreements which contain provisions substantially identical
to those contained in Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer
hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in
transactions with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto,
which are executing agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions
substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement
contemporaneously herewith.  In no event shall the Issuer offer,
solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly on
its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers
as specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.

     1.3     The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination of $250,000
or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will bear such
interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount
from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and the
Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 364 days from the date of
issuance and may have such terms as are specified in Exhibit C hereto
or the Private Placement Memorandum.   The Notes shall not contain any
provision for extension, renewal or automatic "rollover."

     1.4     The authentication and issuance of, and payment for, the
Notes shall be effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent
Agreement, and the Notes shall be either individual physical
certificates or book-entry notes evidenced by one or more master notes
(each, a "Master Note") registered in the name of The Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") or its nominee, in the form or forms annexed to the
Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

     1.5     If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of
the purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged
by the Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to
the date of issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and
interest rate or interest rate index and margin (in the case of

                                  1

<PAGE>

interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes
issued on a discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the
Dealer's services hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer
shall cause such Note to be issued and delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement and payment for such
Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof, either directly or through
the Dealer, to the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the account of the
Issuer.  Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is
expressly acting as an agent for the Issuer and a purchaser shall
either fail to accept delivery of or make payment for a Note on the
date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly notify the Issuer,
and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the Note, the
Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer against its return
of the Note to the Issuer, in the case of a certificated Note, and upon
notice of such failure in the case of a book-entry Note.  If such
failure occurred for any reason other than default by the Dealer, the
Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer on an equitable basis for the
Dealer's loss of the use of such funds for the period such funds were
credited to the Issuer's account, but only for the period after the
Note is returned to the Issuer or the Issuer is so notified.

     1.6     The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to
observe the following procedures in connection with offers, sales and
subsequent resales or other transfers of the Notes:

     (a)   Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall
be made only to: (i) investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be
Qualified Institutional Buyers, Institutional Accredited Investors or
Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investors and (ii) non-bank
fiduciaries or agents that will be purchasing Notes for one or more
accounts, each of which is reasonably believed by the Dealer to be an
Institutional Accredited Investor or Sophisticated Individual
Accredited Investor.

     (b)   Resales and other transfers of the Notes by the holders
thereof shall be made only in accordance with the restrictions in the
legend described in clause (e) below.

     (c)   No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used
in connection with the offering of the Notes.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of the
Dealer, the Issuer shall not issue any press release or place or
publish any "tombstone" or other advertisement relating to the Notes.

     (d)   No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than
$250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a
smaller principal or face amount.  If the purchaser is a non-bank
fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such
purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face
amount of Notes.

     (e)   Offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer through the
Dealer acting as agent for the Issuer shall be made in accordance with
Rule 506 under the Securities Act, and shall be subject to the
restrictions described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto.  A
legend substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as
part of the Private Placement Memorandum used in connection with offers
and sales of Notes hereunder, as well as on each individual certificate
representing a Note and each Master Note representing book-entry Notes
offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement.

     (f)   The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each
purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the
then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has
previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then
in effect.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that
any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask
questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer

                                    2
<PAGE>

and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.

     (g)   The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of
the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes
that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at
its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of
Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with
Rule 144A(d).

     (h)   In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by the
Dealer would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall
immediately notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of
such fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Dealer an
amendment or supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing
the Notes that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and
any other relevant information relating thereto.

     (i)   The Issuer represents that it is not currently issuing
commercial paper in the United States market in reliance upon the
exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Issuer
agrees that, if it shall issue commercial paper after the date hereof
in reliance upon such exemption (a) the proceeds from the sale of the
Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such
commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer
will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the
offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section
3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes
hereunder; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements
of Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act in selling commercial paper or
other short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United
States.

     (j)   The Issuer hereby agrees that, not later than 15 days after
the first sale of Notes as contemplated by this Agreement, it will file
with the SEC a notice on Form D in accordance with Rule 503 under the
Securities Act and that it will thereafter file such amendments to such
notice as Rule 503 may require.

     1.7     The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer,
in connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:

     (a)   The Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as
permitted by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither
the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers
referred to in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has
offered or sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the
Issuer (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the
Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from, any
person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in
Section 1.2 hereof.  The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted
by Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by
the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as
contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of
Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person
other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2
hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) will offer the
Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to,
or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than
the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof, it
being understood that such agreement is made with a view to bringing
the offer and sale of the Notes within the exemption provided by
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 thereunder and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Issuer hereby
represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to take, and

                                    3

<PAGE>

will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause the offering
and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any other offering of
securities, whether such offering is made by the Issuer or some other
party or parties.

     (b)   The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the
sale of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the
purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of
Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In the event that the Issuer
determines to use such proceeds for the purpose of buying, carrying or
trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of
another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least
five business days' prior written notice to that effect.  The Issuer
shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it
commences to purchase securities with the proceeds of the Notes.
Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal
and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the
extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations
thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes either (i) only to offerees
it reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to
Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for
other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with
Rule 144A or (ii) in a manner which would not cause a violation of
Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder.

Section 2.    Representations and Warranties of Issuer.

     The Issuer represents and warrants that:

     2.1     The Issuer is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
has all the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Notes, this Agreement and the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.2     This Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement
have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer
enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.3     The Notes have been duly authorized, and when issued as
provided in the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, and when the
consideration therefor is received by the Issuer, will be duly and
validly issued and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.4     The offer and sale of the Notes in the manner contemplated
hereby do not require registration of the Notes under the Securities
Act, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section
4(2) thereof and Regulation D thereunder, and no indenture in respect
of the Notes is required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended.

     2.5     The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer.

     2.6     Except as provided in Section 1.6(j) hereof,  no consent
or action of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or
public regulatory body or authority, including the SEC, is required to
                                  4

<PAGE>

authorize, or is otherwise required in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of, this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement, except as may be required by the securities
or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and
sale of the Notes.

     2.7     Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the issuance of the Notes
in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the
fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof by the Issuer, will (i) result in the creation or imposition of
any mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon
any of the properties or assets of the Issuer, or (ii) violate or
result in a breach or a default under any of the terms of the Issuer's
charter documents or by-laws, any contract or instrument to which the
Issuer is a party or by which it or its property is bound, or any law
or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
government instrumentality, to which the Issuer is subject or by which
it or its property is bound, which breach or default would have a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
operations or business prospects of the Issuer or the ability of the
Issuer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.8     There is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending,
or to the knowledge of the Issuer threatened, against or affecting the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries which would result in a material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), operations or
business prospects of the Issuer or the ability of the Issuer to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.9     The Issuer is not an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     2.10    Neither the Private Placement Memorandum nor the Company
Information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

     2.11    Each (a) issuance of Notes by the Issuer hereunder and (b)
amendment or supplement of the Private Placement Memorandum shall be
deemed a representation and warranty by the Issuer to the Dealer, as of
the date thereof, that, both before and after giving effect to such
issuance and after giving effect to such amendment or supplement, (i)
the representations and warranties given by the Issuer set forth in
this Section 2 remain true and correct on and as of such date as if
made on and as of such date, (ii) in the case of an issuance of Notes,
the Notes being issued on such date have been duly and validly issued
and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer,
enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) in the case of an
issuance of Notes, since the date of the most recent Private Placement
Memorandum, there has been no material adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or business prospects of the
Issuer which has not been disclosed to the Dealer in writing.

Section 3.    Covenants and Agreements of Issuer.

     The Issuer covenants and agrees that:

event prior to any subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder) of any
amendment to, modification of or waiver with respect to, the Notes or
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, including a complete copy of
any such amendment, modification or waiver.

     3.2.     The Issuer shall, whenever there shall occur any material
change in the Issuer's condition (financial or otherwise), operations
or business prospects or any development or occurrence in relation to
the Issuer that would be material to holders of the Notes or potential
holders of the Notes (including any downgrading or receipt of any
notice of intended or potential downgrading or any review for potential
change in the rating accorded any of the Issuer's securities by any
nationally recognized statistical rating organization which has
published a rating of the Notes), promptly, and in any event prior to
any subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder, notify the Dealer (by
telephone, confirmed in writing) of such change, development or
occurrence.

     3.3.     The Issuer shall from time to time furnish to the Dealer
such information as the Dealer may reasonably request, including,
without limitation, any press releases or material provided by the
Issuer to any national securities exchange or rating agency, regarding

authorization and execution of the Notes and (iii) the Issuer's ability
to pay the Notes as they mature.

     3.4.     The Issuer will take all such action as the Dealer may
reasonably request to ensure that each offer and each sale of the Notes
will comply with any applicable state Blue Sky laws; provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obligated to file any general consent to
service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or subject itself to
taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not otherwise so subject.

     3.5.     The Issuer will not be in default of any of its material
obligations hereunder, under the Notes or under the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement, at any time that any of the Notes are outstanding.

Section 4.    Disclosure.

     4.1.     The Private Placement Memorandum and its contents (other
than the Dealer Information) shall be the sole responsibility of the
Issuer, provided that prior to any distribution by the Dealer, the
Dealer submits the Private Placement Memorandum to the Issuer for
review, and the Issuer approves of the Private Placement Memorandum in
writing.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall contain a statement

                                   6

<PAGE>

expressly offering an opportunity for each prospective purchaser to ask
questions of, and receive answers from, the Issuer concerning the
offering of Notes and to obtain relevant additional information which
the Issuer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or
expense.

     4.2.     The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the
Company Information as it becomes available. The Issuer shall be deemed
to have furnished Company Information when such information has been
posted on the Internet website of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (http://www.sec.gov) or on its own Internet website as
previously identified to the Dealer or if the Dealer or its affiliate
shall have been furnished such information pursuant to other
contractual arrangements with the Issuer.

     4.3.     (a)  The Issuer further agrees to notify the Dealer
promptly upon the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the
Issuer that would cause the Company Information then in existence to
include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

     (b)   In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it
then has Notes it is holding in inventory, the Issuer agrees promptly
to supplement or amend the Private Placement Memorandum so that the
Private Placement Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
and the Issuer shall make such supplement or amendment available to the
Dealer.

     (c)   In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer
that it is then holding Notes in inventory and (iii) the Issuer chooses
not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in
the manner described in clause (b) above, then all solicitations and
sales of Notes shall be suspended until such time as the Issuer has so
amended or supplemented the Private Placement Memorandum, and made such
amendment or supplement available to the Dealer.

     (d)   Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), the
Issuer shall review, amend and supplement the Private Placement
Memorandum on a periodic basis, but no less than at least once annually,
to incorporate current financial information of the Issuer to the
extent necessary to ensure that the information provided in the Private
Placement Memorandum is accurate and complete.

Section 5.    Indemnification and Contribution.

     5.1    The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer,
each individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other
entity controlling the Dealer, any affiliate of the Dealer or any such
controlling entity and their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, incorporators, shareholders, servants, trustees and agents
(hereinafter the "Indemnitees") against any and all liabilities,
penalties, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, claims, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel) or judgments of whatever kind or nature (each a "Claim"),
imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees arising
out of or based upon (i) any allegation that the Private Placement
Memorandum (provided that prior to any distribution by the Dealer, the
Dealer shall have submitted the Private Placement Memorandum to the
Issuer for review, and the Issuer shall have approved of the Private
Placement Memorandum in writing), the Company Information or any
information provided by the Issuer to the Dealer included (as of any
relevant time) or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted (as of any relevant time) or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) arising out of or

                                 7

<PAGE>

based upon the breach by the Issuer of any agreement, covenant or
representation made in or pursuant to this Agreement.  This
indemnification shall not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out
of or is based upon Dealer Information or the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Dealer in the performance of, or the failure
to perform, its obligations under this Agreement.

     5.2    Provisions relating to claims made for indemnification
under this Section 5 are set forth on Exhibit B to this Agreement.

     5.3    In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section
5 is held to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the
Indemnitees, although applicable in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5, the Issuer shall contribute to the aggregate costs incurred
by the Dealer in connection with any Claim in the proportion of the
respective economic interests of the Issuer and the Dealer; provided,
however, that such contribution by the Issuer shall be in an amount
such that the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer do not exceed the
aggregate of the commissions and fees earned by the Dealer hereunder
with respect to the issue or issues of Notes to which such Claim
relates.  The respective economic interests shall be calculated by
reference to the aggregate proceeds to the Issuer of the Notes issued
hereunder and the aggregate commissions and fees earned by the Dealer
hereunder.

                             Exhibit B
             Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification

(a)  The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all expenses
     (including reasonable fees and disbursements of internal and
     external counsel) as they are incurred by it in connection with
     investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or
     action in respect of which indemnification may be sought under
     Section 5 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to any
     such proceedings) provided, however, that if it is found in any
     such action, proceeding or investigation that any loss, claim,
     damage or liability of an Indemnitee has resulted from the Dealer
     Information or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
     Indemnitee in performing the services that are the subject of this
     Agreement, the Indemnitee shall repay such portion of the
     reimbursed amounts that is attributable to expenses incurred in
     relation to the act or omission of the Indemnitee which is the
     subject of such finding.

(b)  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence
     of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is
     to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the
     existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the
     Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may
     have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not
     otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the
     forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and
     (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from
     liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on
     account of this indemnity agreement.  In case any such Claim is
     made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the
     existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate
     therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice
     delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the control and defense
     thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee;
     provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the
     Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded
     that there may be legal defenses available to it which are
     materially different from or additional to those available to the
     Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense
     of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee
     shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
     legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.  Upon receipt of
     notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer's election
     so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the
     Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such
     Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in
     connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs
     of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed
     separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal
     defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding
     sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not
     be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in
     addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any
     Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the
     Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not
     have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to
     represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of
     existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in
     writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee.  The
     indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the
     Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the
     Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding
     upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs
     and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee.
     The Issuer agrees that without the Dealer's prior written consent
     (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), it will not settle,
     compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in
     respect of which indemnification may be sought under the
     indemnification provision of the Agreement (whether or not the
     Dealer or any other Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to
     such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i)
     includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all
     liability arising out of such Claim and (ii) does not include a
     statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure
     to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee.

                             Exhibit C
   Statement of Terms for Interest - Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of
                            NIKE, Inc.


THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC [PRICING] [PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM]
SUPPLEMENT (THE "SUPPLEMENT") (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE
TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

1.  General.  (a)  The obligations of the Issuer to which these terms
apply (each a "Note") are represented by one or more Master Notes (each,
a "Master Note") issued in the name of (or of a nominee for) The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), which Master Note includes the terms
and provisions for the Issuer's Interest-Bearing Commercial Paper Notes
that are set forth in this Statement of Terms, since this Statement of
Terms constitutes an integral part of the Underlying Records as defined
and referred to in the Master Note.

(b)  "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that
is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are
authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be
closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined
below) is also a London Business Day.  "London Business Day" means, a
day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in
U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.

2.  Interest.  (a)  Each Note will bear interest at a fixed rate (a
"Fixed Rate Note") or at a floating rate (a "Floating Rate Note").

(b)  The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the
following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a
Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount
Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be
issued (the "Issue Date"); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined
below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at
which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment
Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the
Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates
and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below),
and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating
the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable
specifically to such Note.  "Original Issue Discount Note" means a Note
which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that
exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and
which the Supplement indicates will be an "Original Issue Discount
Note".

(c)  Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the
rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount
thereof is paid or made available for payment.  Interest on each Fixed
Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement
(each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the
Maturity Date (as defined below).  Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of
principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the next
succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in
respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.
(d)  The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest
Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an
interest rate basis (a "Base Rate") plus or minus a number of basis
points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point)
(the "Spread"), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the
"Spread Multiplier"), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or
made available for payment.  The Supplement will designate which of the
following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note:
(a) the CD Rate (a "CD Rate Note"), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a
"Commercial Paper Rate Note"), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a "Federal
Funds Rate Note"), (d) LIBOR (a "LIBOR Note"), (e) the Prime Rate (a
"Prime Rate Note"), (f) the Treasury Rate (a "Treasury Rate Note") or
(g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily,
weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the "Interest Reset
Period").  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an
"Interest Reset Date") will be, unless otherwise specified in the
Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each
Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury
Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case
of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in
the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday
of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly,
the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the
case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third
Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any
Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day,
such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a
Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business
Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date
shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each
Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually
(the "Interest Payment Period") and on the Maturity Date.  Unless
otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below,
the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an "Interest
Payment Date" for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of
Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the
third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with
a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March,
June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes
with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of
the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity
Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.

If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an
Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise
be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall
be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the
case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately
preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and
interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no
interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after
such maturity.

Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes
will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from
and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid,
as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On
the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will
include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued
interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a
Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued
interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors
calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is
being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for
each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable
to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate,
Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by
the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate
is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be
(i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with
respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below)
pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an
Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest
Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date,
subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread
Multiplier.

The "Interest Determination Date" where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or
the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next
preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date
where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be
the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest
Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second
London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The
Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate
will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls
when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are
normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a
legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following
Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the
preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date
pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding
week.

The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or
obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.

The "Calculation Date," where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i)
the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination
Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment
Date or Maturity Date.

All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless
otherwise specified.

The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent
which party will be the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent")
with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will
provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the
interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset
Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying
Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate
Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in
such interest rate.

All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes
will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.
For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655%
(or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any
calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S.
dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to
the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).

CD Rate Notes

"CD Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for
negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as
published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"FRB") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or
any successor publication of the FRB ("H.15(519)") under the heading
"CDs (Secondary Market)".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest
Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519),
available through the world wide website of the FRB at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor
site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the
purpose of displaying the applicable rate ("H.15 Daily Update") under
the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)".

If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update
by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will
determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of
three leading nonbank dealers1 in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates
of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for
negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States
money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for
negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to
the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set
forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such
Interest Determination Date.

Commercial Paper Rate Notes

"Commercial Paper Rate" means the Money Market Yield (calculated as
described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519)
under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money
Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily
Update under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in
either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will
determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the
arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest
Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial
paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial
paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond
rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such
Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then
in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" will be a yield calculated in accordance with the
following formula:

                         D x 360
Money Market Yield = _______________ x 100
                      360 - (D x M)

1  Such nonblank dealers referred to in this Statement of Terms may include
    affiliates of the Dealer.

<PAGE>

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "M"
refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which
interest is being calculated.

Federal Funds Rate Notes

"Federal Funds Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date
for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal
Funds (Effective)" and displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any
successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the
specified page on that service) ("Telerate Page 120").

If the above rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not so
published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate
will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in
H.15 Daily Update under the heading "Federal Funds/(Effective)".

If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal
Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last
transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of
three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City
selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest
Determination Date.

If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds
Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

LIBOR Notes

The London Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") means, with respect to any
Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars
having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as
of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.

If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates
at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest
Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to
prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such
market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index
Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the
Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a single transaction
in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a "Representative Amount").
The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each
of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such
quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such
interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at
approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by
the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European
banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative
Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected
by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then
existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment
Period.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means the display designated as page "3750" on
Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on
that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by

<PAGE>

the British Bankers' Association for the purposes of displaying London
interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).

Prime Rate Notes

"Prime Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as
published in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on
the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such
Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite
the caption "Bank Prime Loan".

If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date
in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent
will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of
interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters
Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or
base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.

If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by
3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine
the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base
lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the
year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by
the Calculation Agent.

If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime
Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest
Determination Date.

"Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page" means the display designated as page
"US PRIME1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other
page as may replace the US PRIME1 page on that service for the purpose
of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States
banks).

Treasury Rate Notes

"Treasury Rate" means:

(1) the rate from the auction held on the Interest Determination Date
(the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury
Bills") having the Index Maturity specified in the Supplement under the
caption "INVESTMENT RATE" on the display on Moneyline Telerate (or any
successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace that
page on that service) ("Telerate Page 56") or page 57 (or any other
page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 57"), or

(2) if the rate referred to in clause (1) is not so published by 3:00

United States Department of the Treasury, or if the  Auction is not
held, the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on the particular Interest
Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Bills as published in
H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury
Bills/Secondary Market", or

(5) if the rate referred to in clause (4) not so published by 3:00 p.m.
on the related Calculation Date, the rate on the particular Interest
Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Bills as published in
H.15 Daily Update, under the caption "U.S. Government

(6) if the rate referred to in clause (5) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the rate on the particular
Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent as the
Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m. on that Interest Determination
Date, of three primary United States government securities dealers
selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with
a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the
Supplement, or

(7) if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting
as mentioned in clause (6), the Treasury Rate in effect on the
particular Interest Determination Date.

"Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage)
calculated in accordance with the following formula:


                            D x N
Bond Equivalent Yield = _____________ x 100
                        360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers
to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number
of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.

3.   Final Maturity.  The Stated Maturity Date for any Note will be the

days from the date of issuance.  On its Stated Maturity Date, or any
date prior to the Stated Maturity Date on which the particular Note
becomes due and payable by the declaration of acceleration, each such
date being referred to as a Maturity Date, the principal amount of each
Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be
immediately due and payable.

4.   Events of Default.  The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to a Note:  (i) default
in any payment of principal of or interest on such Note (including on a
redemption thereof); (ii) the Issuer makes any compromise arrangement
with its creditors generally including the entering into any form of
moratorium with its creditors generally; (iii) a court having
jurisdiction shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the
Issuer in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or there
shall be appointed a receiver, administrator, liquidator, custodian,
trustee or sequestrator (or similar officer) with respect to the whole
or substantially the whole of the assets of the Issuer and any such
decree, order or appointment is not removed, discharged or withdrawn
within 60 days thereafter; or (iv) the Issuer shall commence a
voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an
order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent
to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, administrator,
liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar
official), with respect to the whole or substantially the whole of the
assets of the Issuer or make any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the principal
of each obligation evidenced by such Note (together with interest
accrued and unpaid thereon) shall become, without any notice or demand,
immediately due and payable.2

5.    Obligation Absolute.  No provision of the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement under which the Notes are issued shall alter or impair
the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to
pay the principal of and interest on each Note at the times, place and
rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

6.    Supplement.  Any term contained in the Supplement shall supercede
any conflicting term contained herein.






2  Unlike single payment notes, where a default arises only at the stated
  maturity, interest-bearing notes with multiple payment dates should
  contain a default provision permitting acceleration of the maturity
  if the Issuer defaults on an interest payment.

                     COMMERCIAL PAPER DEALER AGREEMENT


     This agreement (the "Agreement") sets forth the understanding
between the Issuer and the Dealer, each named on the cover page of this
Agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer of
its short-term promissory notes (the "Notes") through the Dealer.

     Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 of
this Agreement.

     The Addendum and Exhibits to this Agreement are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and made fully a part hereof.


Section 1.    Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes.

     1.1     While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to
sell the Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any
sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer
has and shall have no obligation to purchase the Notes from the Issuer
or to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, the
parties hereto agree that in any case where the Dealer purchases Notes
from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the Issuer, such
Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer
contained herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and
conditions and in the manner provided herein.

     1.2     So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in
addition to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer
shall not, without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept
offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with
one or more dealers which may from time to time after the date hereof
become dealers with respect to the Notes by executing with the Issuer
one or more agreements which contain provisions substantially identical
to those contained in Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer
hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in
transactions with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto,
which are executing agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions
substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement
contemporaneously herewith.  In no event shall the Issuer offer,
solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly on
its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers
as specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.

     1.3     The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination of $250,000
or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will bear such
interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount
from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and the
Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 364 days from the date of
issuance and may have such terms as are specified in Exhibit C hereto
or the Private Placement Memorandum.   The Notes shall not contain any
provision for extension, renewal or automatic "rollover."

     1.4     The authentication and issuance of, and payment for, the
Notes shall be effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent
Agreement, and the Notes shall be either individual physical
certificates or book-entry notes evidenced by one or more master notes
(each, a "Master Note") registered in the name of The Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") or its nominee, in the form or forms annexed to the
Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

     1.5     If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of
the purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged
by the Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to
the date of issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and

<PAGE>

interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes
issued on a discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the
Dealer's services hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer
shall cause such Note to be issued and delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement and payment for such
Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof, either directly or through
the Dealer, to the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the account of the
Issuer.  Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is
expressly acting as an agent for the Issuer and a purchaser shall
either fail to accept delivery of or make payment for a Note on the
date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly notify the Issuer,
and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the Note, the
Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer against its return
of the Note to the Issuer, in the case of a certificated Note, and upon
notice of such failure in the case of a book-entry Note.  If such
failure occurred for any reason other than default by the Dealer, the
Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer on an equitable basis for the
Dealer's loss of the use of such funds for the period such funds were
credited to the Issuer's account, but only for the period after the
Note is returned to the Issuer or the Issuer is so notified.

     1.6     The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to
observe the following procedures in connection with offers, sales and
subsequent resales or other transfers of the Notes:

     (a)   Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall
be made only to: (i) investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be
Qualified Institutional Buyers, Institutional Accredited Investors or
Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investors and (ii) non-bank
fiduciaries or agents that will be purchasing Notes for one or more
accounts, each of which is reasonably believed by the Dealer to be an
Institutional Accredited Investor or Sophisticated Individual
Accredited Investor.

     (b)   Resales and other transfers of the Notes by the holders
thereof shall be made only in accordance with the restrictions in the
legend described in clause (e) below.

     (c)   No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used
in connection with the offering of the Notes.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of the
Dealer, the Issuer shall not issue any press release or place or
publish any "tombstone" or other advertisement relating to the Notes.

     (d)   No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than
$250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a
smaller principal or face amount.  If the purchaser is a non-bank
fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such
purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face
amount of Notes.

     (e)   Offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer through the
Dealer acting as agent for the Issuer shall be made in accordance with
Rule 506 under the Securities Act, and shall be subject to the
restrictions described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto.  A
legend substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as
part of the Private Placement Memorandum used in connection with offers
and sales of Notes hereunder, as well as on each individual certificate
representing a Note and each Master Note representing book-entry Notes
offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement.

     (f)   The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each
purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the
then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has
previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then
in effect.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that
any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask
questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer

                                    2
<PAGE>

and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.

     (g)   The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of
the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes
that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at
its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of
Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with
Rule 144A(d).

     (h)   In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by the
Dealer would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall
immediately notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of
such fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Dealer an
amendment or supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing
the Notes that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and
any other relevant information relating thereto.

     (i)   The Issuer represents that it is not currently issuing
commercial paper in the United States market in reliance upon the
exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Issuer
agrees that, if it shall issue commercial paper after the date hereof
in reliance upon such exemption (a) the proceeds from the sale of the
Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such
commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer
will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the
offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section
3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes
hereunder; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements
of Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act in selling commercial paper or
other short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United
States.

     (j)   The Issuer hereby agrees that, not later than 15 days after
the first sale of Notes as contemplated by this Agreement, it will file
with the SEC a notice on Form D in accordance with Rule 503 under the
Securities Act and that it will thereafter file such amendments to such
notice as Rule 503 may require.

     1.7     The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer,
in connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:

     (a)   The Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as
permitted by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither
the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers
referred to in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has
offered or sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the
Issuer (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the
Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from, any
person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in
Section 1.2 hereof.  The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted
by Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by
the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as
contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of
Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person
other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2
hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) will offer the
Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to,
or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than
the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof, it
being understood that such agreement is made with a view to bringing
the offer and sale of the Notes within the exemption provided by
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 thereunder and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Issuer hereby
represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to take, and

                                    3

<PAGE>

will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause the offering
and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any other offering of
securities, whether such offering is made by the Issuer or some other
party or parties.

     (b)   The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the
sale of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the
purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of
Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In the event that the Issuer
determines to use such proceeds for the purpose of buying, carrying or
trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of
another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least
five business days' prior written notice to that effect.  The Issuer
shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it
commences to purchase securities with the proceeds of the Notes.
Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal
and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the
extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations
thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes either (i) only to offerees
it reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to
Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for
other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with
Rule 144A or (ii) in a manner which would not cause a violation of
Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder.

Section 2.    Representations and Warranties of Issuer.

     The Issuer represents and warrants that:

     2.1     The Issuer is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
has all the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Notes, this Agreement and the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.2     This Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement
have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer
enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.3     The Notes have been duly authorized, and when issued as
provided in the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, and when the
consideration therefor is received by the Issuer, will be duly and
validly issued and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.4     The offer and sale of the Notes in the manner contemplated
hereby do not require registration of the Notes under the Securities
Act, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section
4(2) thereof and Regulation D thereunder, and no indenture in respect
of the Notes is required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended.

     2.5     The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer.

     2.6     Except as provided in Section 1.6(j) hereof,  no consent
or action of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or
public regulatory body or authority, including the SEC, is required to

delivery or performance of, this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement, except as may be required by the securities
or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and
sale of the Notes.

     2.7     Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the issuance of the Notes
in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the
fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof by the Issuer, will (i) result in the creation or imposition of
any mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon
any of the properties or assets of the Issuer, or (ii) violate or
result in a breach or a default under any of the terms of the Issuer's
charter documents or by-laws, any contract or instrument to which the
Issuer is a party or by which it or its property is bound, or any law
or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
government instrumentality, to which the Issuer is subject or by which
it or its property is bound, which breach or default would have a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
operations or business prospects of the Issuer or the ability of the
Issuer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.8     There is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending,
or to the knowledge of the Issuer threatened, against or affecting the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries which would result in a material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), operations or
business prospects of the Issuer or the ability of the Issuer to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing
and Paying Agent Agreement.

     2.9     The Issuer is not an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     2.10    Neither the Private Placement Memorandum nor the Company
Information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

     2.11    Each (a) issuance of Notes by the Issuer hereunder and (b)
amendment or supplement of the Private Placement Memorandum shall be
deemed a representation and warranty by the Issuer to the Dealer, as of
the date thereof, that, both before and after giving effect to such
issuance and after giving effect to such amendment or supplement, (i)
the representations and warranties given by the Issuer set forth in
this Section 2 remain true and correct on and as of such date as if
made on and as of such date, (ii) in the case of an issuance of Notes,
the Notes being issued on such date have been duly and validly issued
and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer,
enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) in the case of an
issuance of Notes, since the date of the most recent Private Placement
Memorandum, there has been no material adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or business prospects of the
Issuer which has not been disclosed to the Dealer in writing.

Section 3.    Covenants and Agreements of Issuer.

amendment to, modification of or waiver with respect to, the Notes or
the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, including a complete copy of
any such amendment, modification or waiver.

     3.2.     The Issuer shall, whenever there shall occur any material
change in the Issuer's condition (financial or otherwise), operations

notice of intended or potential downgrading or any review for potential
change in the rating accorded any of the Issuer's securities by any
nationally recognized statistical rating organization which has
published a rating of the Notes), promptly, and in any event prior to
any subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder, notify the Dealer (by
telephone, confirmed in writing) of such change, development or
occurrence.

     3.3.     The Issuer shall from time to time furnish to the Dealer
such information as the Dealer may reasonably request, including,
without limitation, any press releases or material provided by the
Issuer to any national securities exchange or rating agency, regarding

authorization and execution of the Notes and (iii) the Issuer's ability
to pay the Notes as they mature.

     3.4.     The Issuer will take all such action as the Dealer may

will comply with any applicable state Blue Sky laws; provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obligated to file any general consent to
service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or subject itself to
taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not otherwise so subject.

     3.5.     The Issuer will not be in default of any of its material
obligations hereunder, under the Notes or under the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement, at any time that any of the Notes are outstanding.

review, and the Issuer approves of the Private Placement Memorandum in
writing.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall contain a statement

                                   6

<PAGE>

expressly offering an opportunity for each prospective purchaser to ask
questions of, and receive answers from, the Issuer concerning the
offering of Notes and to obtain relevant additional information which
the Issuer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or
expense.

     4.2.     The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the
Company Information as it becomes available. The Issuer shall be deemed
to have furnished Company Information when such information has been
posted on the Internet website of the Securities and Exchange

previously identified to the Dealer or if the Dealer or its affiliate
shall have been furnished such information pursuant to other
contractual arrangements with the Issuer.

     4.3.     (a)  The Issuer further agrees to notify the Dealer
promptly upon the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the
Issuer that would cause the Company Information then in existence to
include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

     (b)   In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it
then has Notes it is holding in inventory, the Issuer agrees promptly
to supplement or amend the Private Placement Memorandum so that the
Private Placement Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,

Dealer.

     (c)   In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer
that it is then holding Notes in inventory and (iii) the Issuer chooses
not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in
the manner described in clause (b) above, then all solicitations and
sales of Notes shall be suspended until such time as the Issuer has so
amended or supplemented the Private Placement Memorandum, and made such
amendment or supplement available to the Dealer.

     (d)   Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), the
Issuer shall review, amend and supplement the Private Placement
Memorandum on a periodic basis, but no less than at least once annually,
to incorporate current financial information of the Issuer to the
extent necessary to ensure that the information provided in the Private
Placement Memorandum is accurate and complete.

Section 5.    Indemnification and Contribution.

     5.1    The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer,
each individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other
entity controlling the Dealer, any affiliate of the Dealer or any such
controlling entity and their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, incorporators, shareholders, servants, trustees and agents
(hereinafter the "Indemnitees") against any and all liabilities,
penalties, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, claims, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel) or judgments of whatever kind or nature (each a "Claim"),
imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees arising
out of or based upon (i) any allegation that the Private Placement
Memorandum (provided that prior to any distribution by the Dealer, the
Dealer shall have submitted the Private Placement Memorandum to the
Issuer for review, and the Issuer shall have approved of the Private
Placement Memorandum in writing), the Company Information or any
information provided by the Issuer to the Dealer included (as of any
relevant time) or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted (as of any relevant time) or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) arising out of or

                                 7

<PAGE>

based upon the breach by the Issuer of any agreement, covenant or
representation made in or pursuant to this Agreement.  This
indemnification shall not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out
of or is based upon Dealer Information or the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Dealer in the performance of, or the failure
to perform, its obligations under this Agreement.

     5.2    Provisions relating to claims made for indemnification
under this Section 5 are set forth on Exhibit B to this Agreement.

     5.3    In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section
5 is held to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the
Indemnitees, although applicable in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5, the Issuer shall contribute to the aggregate costs incurred
by the Dealer in connection with any Claim in the proportion of the
respective economic interests of the Issuer and the Dealer; provided,
however, that such contribution by the Issuer shall be in an amount
such that the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer do not exceed the
aggregate of the commissions and fees earned by the Dealer hereunder
with respect to the issue or issues of Notes to which such Claim
relates.  The respective economic interests shall be calculated by
reference to the aggregate proceeds to the Issuer of the Notes issued
hereunder and the aggregate commissions and fees earned by the Dealer
hereunder.

the time such agreement was entered into,

     (c)   the Issuer shall not be in default of any of its obligations
hereunder, under the Notes or under the Issuing and Paying Agent
Agreement.

                             Exhibit B
             Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification

(a)  The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all expenses
     (including reasonable fees and disbursements of internal and
     external counsel) as they are incurred by it in connection with
     investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or
     action in respect of which indemnification may be sought under
     Section 5 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to any
     such proceedings) provided, however, that if it is found in any
     such action, proceeding or investigation that any loss, claim,
     damage or liability of an Indemnitee has resulted from the Dealer
     Information or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
     Indemnitee in performing the services that are the subject of this
     Agreement, the Indemnitee shall repay such portion of the
     reimbursed amounts that is attributable to expenses incurred in
     relation to the act or omission of the Indemnitee which is the
     subject of such finding.

(b)  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence
     of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is
     to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the
     existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the
     Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may
     have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not
     otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the
     forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and
     (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from
     liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on
     account of this indemnity agreement.  In case any such Claim is
     made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the
     existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate
     therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice
     delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the control and defense
     thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee;
     provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the
     Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded
     that there may be legal defenses available to it which are
     materially different from or additional to those available to the
     Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense
     of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee
     shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
     legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.  Upon receipt of
     notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer's election
     so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the
     Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such
     Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in
     connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs
     of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed
     separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal
     defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding
     sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not
     be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in
     addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any
     Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the
     Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not
     have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to
     represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of
     existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in
     writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee.  The
     indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the
     Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the
     Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding
     upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs
     and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee.
     The Issuer agrees that without the Dealer's prior written consent
     (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), it will not settle,
     compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in
     respect of which indemnification may be sought under the
     indemnification provision of the Agreement (whether or not the
     Dealer or any other Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to
     such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i)
     includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all
     liability arising out of such Claim and (ii) does not include a
     statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure
     to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee.

                             Exhibit C
   Statement of Terms for Interest - Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of
                            NIKE, Inc.


THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC [PRICING] [PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM]
SUPPLEMENT (THE "SUPPLEMENT") (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE
TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

1.  General.  (a)  The obligations of the Issuer to which these terms
apply (each a "Note") are represented by one or more Master Notes (each,
a "Master Note") issued in the name of (or of a nominee for) The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), which Master Note includes the terms
and provisions for the Issuer's Interest-Bearing Commercial Paper Notes
that are set forth in this Statement of Terms, since this Statement of
Terms constitutes an integral part of the Underlying Records as defined
and referred to in the Master Note.

(b)  "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that
is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are
authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be
closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined
below) is also a London Business Day.  "London Business Day" means, a
day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in
U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.

2.  Interest.  (a)  Each Note will bear interest at a fixed rate (a
"Fixed Rate Note") or at a floating rate (a "Floating Rate Note").

(b)  The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the
following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a
Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount
Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be
issued (the "Issue Date"); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined
below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at
which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment
Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the
Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates
and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below),
and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating
the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable
specifically to such Note.  "Original Issue Discount Note" means a Note
which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that
exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and
which the Supplement indicates will be an "Original Issue Discount
Note".

(c)  Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the
rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount
thereof is paid or made available for payment.  Interest on each Fixed
Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement
(each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the
Maturity Date (as defined below).  Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of
principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the next
succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in
respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.
(d)  The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest
Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an
interest rate basis (a "Base Rate") plus or minus a number of basis
points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point)
(the "Spread"), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the
"Spread Multiplier"), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or
made available for payment.  The Supplement will designate which of the
following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note:
(a) the CD Rate (a "CD Rate Note"), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a
"Commercial Paper Rate Note"), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a "Federal
Funds Rate Note"), (d) LIBOR (a "LIBOR Note"), (e) the Prime Rate (a
"Prime Rate Note"), (f) the Treasury Rate (a "Treasury Rate Note") or
(g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily,
weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the "Interest Reset
Period").  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an
"Interest Reset Date") will be, unless otherwise specified in the
Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each
Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury
Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case
of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in
the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday
of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly,
the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the
case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third
Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any
Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day,
such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a
Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business
Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date
shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each
Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually
(the "Interest Payment Period") and on the Maturity Date.  Unless
otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below,
the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an "Interest
Payment Date" for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of
Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the
third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with
a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March,
June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes
with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of
the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity
Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.

If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an
Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise
be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall
be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the
case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately
preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and
interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no
interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after
such maturity.

Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes
will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from
and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid,
as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On
the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will
include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued
interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a
Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued
interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors
calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is
being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for
each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable
to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate,
Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by
the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate
is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be
(i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with
respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below)
pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an
Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest
Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date,
subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread
Multiplier.

The "Interest Determination Date" where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or
the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next
preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date
where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be
the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest
Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second
London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The
Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate
will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls
when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are
normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a
legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following
Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the
preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date
pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding
week.

The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or
obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.

The "Calculation Date," where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i)
the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination
Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment
Date or Maturity Date.

All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless
otherwise specified.

The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent
which party will be the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent")
with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will
provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the
interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset
Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying
Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate
Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in
such interest rate.

All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes
will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.
For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655%
(or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any
calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S.
dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to
the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).

CD Rate Notes

"CD Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for
negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as
published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"FRB") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or
any successor publication of the FRB ("H.15(519)") under the heading
"CDs (Secondary Market)".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest
Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519),
available through the world wide website of the FRB at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor
site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the
purpose of displaying the applicable rate ("H.15 Daily Update") under
the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)".

If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update
by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will
determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of
three leading nonbank dealers1 in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates
of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for
negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States
money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for
negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to
the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set
forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such
Interest Determination Date.

Commercial Paper Rate Notes

"Commercial Paper Rate" means the Money Market Yield (calculated as
described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519)
under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money
Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily
Update under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in
either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will
determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the
arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest
Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial
paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial
paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond
rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such
Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then
in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" will be a yield calculated in accordance with the
following formula:

                         D x 360
Money Market Yield = _______________ x 100
                      360 - (D x M)

1  Such nonblank dealers referred to in this Statement of Terms may include
    affiliates of the Dealer.

<PAGE>

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "M"
refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which
interest is being calculated.

Federal Funds Rate Notes

"Federal Funds Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date
for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal
Funds (Effective)" and displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any
successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the
specified page on that service) ("Telerate Page 120").

If the above rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not so
published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate
will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in
H.15 Daily Update under the heading "Federal Funds/(Effective)".

If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the
Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal
Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last
transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of
three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City
selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest
Determination Date.

If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds
Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

LIBOR Notes

The London Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") means, with respect to any
Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars
having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as
of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.

If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates
at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest
Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to
prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such
market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index
Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the
Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a single transaction
in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a "Representative Amount").
The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each
of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such
quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such
interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at
approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by
the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European
banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative
Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected
by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then
existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment
Period.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means the display designated as page "3750" on
Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on
that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by

<PAGE>

the British Bankers' Association for the purposes of displaying London
interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).

Prime Rate Notes

"Prime Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as
published in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan".

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on
the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such
Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite
the caption "Bank Prime Loan".

If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date
in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent
will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of
interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters
Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or
base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.

If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by
3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine
the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base
lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the
year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by
the Calculation Agent.

If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime
Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest
Determination Date.

"Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page" means the display designated as page
"US PRIME1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other
page as may replace the US PRIME1 page on that service for the purpose
of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States
banks).

Treasury Rate Notes

"Treasury Rate" means:

(1) the rate from the auction held on the Interest Determination Date
(the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury
Bills") having the Index Maturity specified in the Supplement under the
caption "INVESTMENT RATE" on the display on Moneyline Telerate (or any
successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace that
page on that service) ("Telerate Page 56") or page 57 (or any other
page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 57"), or

(2) if the rate referred to in clause (1) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as
defined below) of the rate for the applicable Treasury Bills as
published in H.15 Daily Update, under the caption "U.S. Government
Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High", or

(3) if the rate referred to in clause (2) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield of the
auction rate of the applicable Treasury Bills as announced by the
United States Department of the Treasury, or

(4) if the rate referred to in clause (3) is not so announced by the
United States Department of the Treasury, or if the  Auction is not
held, the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on the particular Interest
Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Bills as published in
H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury
Bills/Secondary Market", or

(5) if the rate referred to in clause (4) not so published by 3:00 p.m.
on the related Calculation Date, the rate on the particular Interest
Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Bills as published in
H.15 Daily Update, under the caption "U.S. Government
Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market", or

(6) if the rate referred to in clause (5) is not so published by 3:00
p.m. on the related Calculation Date, the rate on the particular
Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent as the
Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m. on that Interest Determination
Date, of three primary United States government securities dealers
selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with
a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the
Supplement, or

(7) if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting
as mentioned in clause (6), the Treasury Rate in effect on the
particular Interest Determination Date.

"Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage)
calculated in accordance with the following formula:


                            D x N
Bond Equivalent Yield = _____________ x 100
                        360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers
to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number
of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.

3.   Final Maturity.  The Stated Maturity Date for any Note will be the
date so specified in the Supplement, which shall be no later than 364
days from the date of issuance.  On its Stated Maturity Date, or any
date prior to the Stated Maturity Date on which the particular Note
becomes due and payable by the declaration of acceleration, each such
date being referred to as a Maturity Date, the principal amount of each
Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be
immediately due and payable.

4.   Events of Default.  The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to a Note:  (i) default
in any payment of principal of or interest on such Note (including on a
redemption thereof); (ii) the Issuer makes any compromise arrangement
with its creditors generally including the entering into any form of
moratorium with its creditors generally; (iii) a court having
jurisdiction shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the
Issuer in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or there
shall be appointed a receiver, administrator, liquidator, custodian,
trustee or sequestrator (or similar officer) with respect to the whole
or substantially the whole of the assets of the Issuer and any such
decree, order or appointment is not removed, discharged or withdrawn
within 60 days thereafter; or (iv) the Issuer shall commence a
voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an
order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent
to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, administrator,
liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar
official), with respect to the whole or substantially the whole of the
assets of the Issuer or make any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the principal
of each obligation evidenced by such Note (together with interest
accrued and unpaid thereon) shall become, without any notice or demand,
immediately due and payable.2

5.    Obligation Absolute.  No provision of the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement under which the Notes are issued shall alter or impair
the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to
pay the principal of and interest on each Note at the times, place and
rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

6.    Supplement.  Any term contained in the Supplement shall supercede
any conflicting term contained herein.






2  Unlike single payment notes, where a default arises only at the stated
  maturity, interest-bearing notes with multiple payment dates should
  contain a default provision permitting acceleration of the maturity
  if the Issuer defaults on an interest payment.
