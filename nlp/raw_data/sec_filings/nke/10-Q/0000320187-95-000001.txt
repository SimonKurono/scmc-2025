Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
     During the second quarter ended November 30, 1994, record revenues 
increased 31%, gross margins improved by .9% and selling and 
administrative expenses reduced as a percentage of sales, combining 
to increase net income by 62%, the first quarter to quarter 
comparison increase in six periods and the largest since May, 1990. 
Net income for the period was $84.9 million or $1.16 per share, 
compared to $52.3 million or $0.69 per share for the same period in the 
prior year. Earnings per share increased 68% as compared to the 62% 
increase in net income, primarily due to the Company's share repurchase 
program.  In addition to being a record second quarter in earnings, the 
Company recognized several other milestones.  This was the first second 
quarter with revenue in excess of $1 billion, the first time the Company's 
trailing twelve months'revenues have exceeded $4 billion, and the largest 
advance order release ever announced. 
 
     Revenues increased $248 million over the $806 million reported 
in the same period of the prior year.  United States footwear was a 
strong contributor with growth of $115 million, or 34%, resulting from 
an increase of 39% in pairs shipped and a 4% decrease in average selling 
price. Revenues were strong across all categories, including an increase
in basketball which was the first comparative increase in 18 months. 
International revenues increased $106 million, or 32%, composed of 28% and 
41% increases in international footwear and apparel revenues, respectively. 
The international growth included a 22% increase from new 
NIKE-owned subsidiaries in Japan and Korea and a positive 5% affect from 
foreign exchange translation, partially offset by decreases in France and 
Germany which together combined for a 7% decrease in international's total 
revenues. U.S. apparel increased $23 million or 30%, and anticipates an 
increase for the full fiscal year.  Other brands, which includes Cole 
Haan (R), Tetra Plastics, and Sports Specialties, increased 8%. The 
breakdown of revenues follows:

</TABLE> 
 
     Consolidated gross margins improved over the prior year, increasing 
from 38.4% in the prior year second quarter to 39.3% in the current year. 
The increase was a result of the high volume of revenues, along with 
strong demand for NIKE products combined with sound inventory management 
which resulted in a smaller percentage of lower margin closeout sales.  The  
Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory management, 
minimizing foreign exchange risk, and production sourcing in order to 
maximize gross profit. 
 
 
      Selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of
revenues from 27.7% during the prior year second quarter to 25.5% in the 
current year.  On an absolute dollar basis, spending increased $45 million, 
or 20%, with all new NIKE-owned subsidiaries accounting for $29 million of 
the increase.  International operations in total added $36 million, a 
result of the new subsidiaries and planned increases in international 
infrastructure development.  Also, the foreign currency translation impact 
increased spending by approximately $4 million. U.S. operations were up 
$9 million, primarily in planned marketing expenses.  The Company intends 
to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through of the high level 
of orders discussed below.  As a result, the Company expects selling and 
administrative costs as a percentage of revenues for the current year to 
approximate the prior year results. 
 
     Interest expenses for the quarter increased slightly over the prior 
year due to increased operational short-term borrowings related to the 
new NIKE subsidiaries mentioned previously, offset by lower U.S. borrowings. 
Other income decreased $2.8 million, primarily as a result of increased 
other expenses - including profit sharing, foreign currency 
transactions, asset disposals and goodwill - offset partially by 
increased interest income. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.0% compared 
to 37.43% in the prior year.  Last year's second quarter included a reduction 
for the tax impact of permanently reinvesting foreign earnings overseas, 
as more fully discussed in that respective 10-Q.  The Company 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1995 will approximate the 39.1% rate 
for the full fiscal year 1994. 
 
      Worldwide orders for athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for 
delivery from December 1994 through April 1995 were approximately $1.95 
billion, 34% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of 
the prior year. This represents a record amount of orders for any period, 
and will require a significant portion of our production capacity to be 
devoted to filling these orders, potentially impacting availability of 
product for "at once" shipments.  These orders are not necessarily indicative 
of total revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of advance orders 
and "at once" shipments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and 
year to year.  Additionally, as international operations continue to shift 
to a greater emphasis on futures orders, this mix again may vary.  Finally, 
exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons. 
 
 
       After a six-month "Special 301" investigation under the 1974 Trade 
Act, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative ("USTR") announced on 
December 31, 1994 that the United States will take retaliatory trade 
action against the People's Republic of China if China does not agree to 
address U.S. intellectual property rights concerns.  On or before 
February 4, 1994 the USTR will make a final determination as to whether 
China's intellectual property right's enforcement policies and practices 
are unreasonable and constitute a burden on, or restrict, U.S. commerce. 
The USTR has published a preliminary list of products from China that it 
would target if sanctions were imposed, although the USTR may later 
reduce that list of targeted products.  Seven categories of footwear are 
among the various products on the list.  Targeted products would be 
assessed tariffs of 100 percent in addition to the current tariffs.  A 
portion of the footwear that the Company imports from China into the 
U.S. falls into four of the seven potentially targeted categories of 
footwear, and sanctions would effectively eliminate imports from China 
in those categories.  However, at the time of filing this report the 
Company anticipates that the sanctions, if imposed, would not have a 
material adverse effect on the Company due to the wide range of product 
sourcing available to the Company, and the lack of significance of the 
targeted categories to the Company's overall production.  
 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
_______________________________ 
 
     The Company's financial position remained strong, with working capital 
rising $86 million since May 31, 1994.  The working capital ratio was 3.2:1 
at November 30, 1994 and at May 31, 1994.  
 
     Cash and equivalents increased $27 million primarily as a result of 
cash flow from operations, offset partially by cash used by investing 
activities, including the purchase of a new NIKE-owned subsidiary, and 
cash used by financing activities, primarily the purchase of 1,000,000 
shares of NIKE stock under the stock repurchase program announced in 
July 1993. 
 
     The increase in accounts receivable of $73 million was due to 
sales growth in both October and November over last May's comparable two 
month period. 
 
     Overall inventories decreased $11 million since May 31.  Gross U.S. 
footwear inventory is down $33 million and gross U.S. apparel inventory 
is down $4 million, however, international inventories have increased 
$25 million, primarily due to new NIKE-owned 
subsidiaries. 
 
     During the quarter, the Company announced a 25% increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share from the previous $0.20 per 
share. 
 
     Subsequent to November 30, 1994, the Company has commenced 
an offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Canstar Sports, 
Inc., the world's largest hockey equipment manufacturer for Canadian 
$27.50 per share in cash.  The total value of the proposed transaction 
is approximately U.S.$395 million.  The Company also announced that 
it entered into an agreement with the principal shareholders, who 
together represent 46% of Canstar's shares, to acquire those shares for 
the same price.  The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and 
other customary conditions.
 
     The debt to equity ratio at November 30, 1994 was .4:1 compared to 
.4:1 at May 31, 1994 and .3:1 at November 30, 1993.  Management believes that 
funds generated by operations, together with currently available resources, 
will adequately finance anticipated fiscal 1995 expenditures.  At  
November 30, 1994, the Company had $300 million available in committed  
unused lines of credit.
