Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
     The quarter ended February 28, 1995 established a new third quarter 
high, with net income increasing 51% as a result of record revenues, gross 
margin improvement and selling and administrative expenses reducing as a 
percentage of sales.  Net income for the period was $95.3 million or $1.29 
per share, compared to $63.2 million or $0.85 per share for the same period 
in the prior year.  The 52% increase in earnings per share as compared to 
the 51% increase in net income is primarily due to the Company's share 
repurchase program. 
 
     Revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time in a third quarter, 
increasing 29% to $1.125 billion compared to $872 million in the prior 
year.  This is the fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of 
$1 billion.  United States apparel increased 39% ($33 million), growing at a 
slightly faster pace than the U.S. footwear business, which was up 27% 
($126 million) over the previous year due to a 21% increase in pairs 
shipped and a 5% increase in average selling price.  The Company had increases 
in all categories of both U.S. footwear and apparel.  International revenues 
increased $85 million, 33% over last year's third quarter, with growth in 
footwear revenues of 29% and apparel revenues of 46%.  Favorable exchange 
rates contributed $16 million of the increase and new NIKE-owned subsidiaries 
in Korea, Argentina, and Austria added $41 million.  Other brands, which 
include Cole Haan, Tetra Plastics, and Sports Speciatlies, increased 
16%.  The breakdown of revenues follows:

</TABLE> 
 
     Consolidated gross margins for the quarter were 39.7% compared to 
38.4% last year.  The increase was a result of the high volume of revenues 
and a smaller percentage of closeout sales in the current year combined with 
lower margins in the prior year due to difficulties in other brands, 
including Sports Specialties and the decision to discontinue the i.e. 
division.  The Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory 
management, minimizing foreign exchange risk, and production sourcing in 
order to maximize gross profit. 
 
      Selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of
revenues from 26.5% during the prior year third quarter to 24.7% in the 
current year.  On an absolute dollar basis, spending increased $47 million, 
or 20%, with new NIKE-owned subsidiaries accounting for $8 million of 
the increase.  International operations added $24 million of spending, a 
result of the new subsidiaries and planned increases in international 
infrastructure development.  Also, the foreign currency translation impact 
increased spending by approximately $6 million. U.S. operations were up 
$19 million, primarily in planned marketing expenses.  The Company intends 
to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through of the high level 
of orders discussed below.  As a result, the Company expects selling and 
administrative costs as a percentage of revenues for the current year to 
approximate the prior year results. 
 
     Interest expenses for the quarter increased over the prior year due 
to both increased operational short-term borrowings at new NIKE subsidiaries 
and other international locations, and increased short-term borrowings 
in the U.S. primarily due to increased cash operational needs and the 
purchase of Canstar during the third quarter.  Other income decreased 
$8.6 million mostly due to increases in profit share plan expense, foreign 
currency transactions, and goodwill along with shutdown expenses in 
connection with the continued consolidation of warehouse facilities in 
Europe.  These increases were offset partially by increased interest income. 
In addition, a gain on insurance proceeds as a result of the flood at Tetra 
Plastics increased other income in the prior year. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.0% compared 
to 38.4% in the prior year.  Last year's third quarter included a reduction 
for the tax impact of permanently reinvesting foreign earnings overseas, 
as more fully discussed in the Form 10-Q filed for that quarter.  The Company 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1995 will approximate the 39.1% rate 
for the full fiscal year 1994. 
 
      Worldwide orders for athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for 
delivery from March 1995 through July 1995 were approximately $2.4 
billion, 37% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of 
the prior year. This represents a record amount of orders for any period, 
and a significant portion of our production capacity will be 
devoted to filling these orders, potentially impacting availability of 
product for "at once" shipments.  These orders are not necessarily indicative 
of total revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of advance orders 
and "at once" shipments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and 
year to year.  Additionally, as international operations continue to shift 
to a greater emphasis on futures orders, this mix again may vary.  Finally, 
exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
_______________________________ 
 
       During the quarter, the Company finalized the purchase of all of 
the outstanding shares of Canstar Sports Inc. for Canadian $27.50 per 
share in cash.  See Note 5 for further discussion. 
 
     The Company's financial position remained strong.  However, working 
capital decreased $196 million since May 31, 1994 due to increased 
operational borrowings and cash used to purchase Canstar Sports Inc. 
The working capital ratio was 2.1:1 at February 28, 1995 compared to 
3.2:1 at May 31, 1994.  
 
     Cash and equivalents decreased $276 million primarily as a result of 
the Canstar Sports Inc. purchase, offset partially by cash provided by 
operations. Cash was also used to purchase 1,160,000 additional shares of 
NIKE stock under the stock repurchase program announced in July 1993. 
 
     Accounts Receivable is at an all-time high, with the increase of 
$227 million, or 32%, a direct result of the 42% increase in sales in both 
January and February over last May's comparable two month period. 
 
     Overall inventories increased $158 million since May 31.  Gross U.S. 
footwear inventory is down $12 million due to strong demand, however, 
international inventories have increased $95 million, $30 million of which 
is due to new NIKE-owned subsidiaries with the remaining increase in 
preparation for increased demand in the fourth quarter.  In addition, Canstar 
Sports Inc. added $72 million in inventory. 
 
     The debt to equity ratio at February 28, 1995 was .5:1 compared to 
.4:1 at May 31, 1994 and .4:1 at February 28, 1994.  Management believes that 
funds generated by operations, together with currently available resources, 
will adequately finance anticipated fiscal 1995 expenditures.  At  
February 28, 1995, the Company had $300 million available in committed  
unused lines of credit.
