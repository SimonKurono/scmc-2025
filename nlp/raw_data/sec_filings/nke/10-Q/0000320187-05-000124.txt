         __________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 2005 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2006 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.


NOTE 2 - Inventories:
         ___________

      Inventory balances of $1,850.6 million and $1,811.1 million at August 31,

NOTE 6 - Stock-Based Compensation:
         ________________________

     The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" as permitted by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (FAS 123). Substantially all options granted by the Company have
an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of grant, and
accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized.  The Company also has an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) that qualifies as a non-compensatory
employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code,
and accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized.

     If the Company had accounted for stock options and ESPP purchase rights
issued to employees in accordance with FAS 123, the Company's pro forma net
income and pro forma earnings per share would have been reported as follows:

</TABLE>

     The pro forma effects of applying FAS 123 may not be representative of
the effects on reported net income and earnings per share for future periods
as options vest over several years and additional awards are made each year.

     As disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as of May 31,
2005, the Company is currently evaluating SFAS No. 123R "Share-Based Payment"
(FAS 123R) and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to determine the fair value method to measure
compensation expense, the appropriate assumptions to include in the fair value
model and the transition method to use upon adoption.  The impact of the
adoption of FAS 123R is not known at this time due to these factors as well as
the unknown level of stock-based payments granted in future years.  The effect
on the Company's results of operations of expensing stock options using the
Black-Scholes model is presented in the table above.

     Under certain conditions, stock options granted by the Company are
eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee. The FASB
clarified in FAS 123R that the fair value of such stock options should be
expensed based on an accelerated vesting schedule or immediately, rather than
ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant. The Company's pro forma
disclosure above currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over
the stated vesting period, expensing all unvested shares upon actual
retirement. The SEC clarified that companies should continue to follow the
vesting method they have been using until adoption of FAS 123R, then apply the
accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees
eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement. Had the Company
been accounting for such stock options using the accelerated vesting schedule
for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement, the
Company would have recognized additional stock-based compensation expense in
the above pro forma of $0.06 and $0.09 per diluted share for the three months
ended August 31, 2005 and August 31, 2004, respectively.  The Company grants
the majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of
each fiscal year.  As such, accelerated vesting would result in increased
expense recognition in the first three months of the fiscal year and a
reduction of expense recorded in the remaining nine months of the fiscal year,
as compared to the expense recorded by the Company under our current policy of
expensing such options ratably over the stated vesting period.


NOTE 7 - Earnings Per Common Share:
         _________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase 5.7 million and 5.0
million shares of common stock were outstanding at August 31, 2005 and
August 31, 2004, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the
effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 8 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions for operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity excluding
NIKE Golf and Bauer NIKE Hockey.  Each NIKE brand geographic segment operates
predominantly in one industry:  the design, production, marketing and selling
of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. The "Other" category
shown below represents activities of Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, Bauer
NIKE Hockey Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, Converse Inc., and
Exeter Brands Group LLC (beginning August 11, 2004), which are considered
immaterial for individual disclosure based on the aggregation criteria in SFAS
No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents income before income taxes as shown in the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Reconciling items for pre-tax
income represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting including corporate activity, certain
currency exchange rate gains and losses on transactions, and intercompany
eliminations for specific income statement items in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Accounts receivable, net, inventories, and property, plant and equipment,
net for operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided
below.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, our revenues grew 8% to $3.9
billion, net income grew 32% to $432.3 million and we delivered diluted
earnings per share of $1.61, a 33% increase versus the first quarter of fiscal
2005. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin percentage increased 80
basis points to 45.3%, driven largely by foreign currency transaction
benefits. Lower demand creation spending in the first quarter of fiscal 2006
compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2005 also drove profit growth in the
quarter. The lower demand creation expense reflected shifts in the timing of
spending in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005.

Consolidated Operating Results

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, consolidated revenues grew 8% versus
the first quarter of fiscal 2005; one percentage point of this growth was
attributable to changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the stronger
euro. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, revenue growth in
our international regions contributed 3 percentage points of the consolidated
revenue growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, as all three of our
international regions posted higher revenues. The U.S. Region contributed 3
percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for the first quarter.
Sales in our Other businesses drove the balance of the improvement for the
quarter.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin
percentage improved 80 basis points compared to the prior year's first
quarter, from 44.5% to 45.3%. The primary factors contributing to the improved
gross margin percentage for the first quarter were as follows:

     (1)  Higher gross margins in our international regions contributed
          approximately 80 basis points to the consolidated gross margin
          improvement in the first quarter. This improvement reflected higher
          gross margins in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and
          Americas regions that were partially offset by gross margin declines
          in our Asia Pacific Region. This improvement was driven by changes
          in the year-over-year euro hedge rates, partially offset by the
          impact of lower in-line pricing margins (net revenue for current
          product offerings minus product costs) in our EMEA and Asia Pacific
          regions (as discussed below):

           (a) For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, year-over-year currency
               hedge rate improvements, primarily the euro, contributed
               approximately 180 basis points to our consolidated gross margin
               percentage.

           (b) Lower in-line pricing margins on wholesale products in the EMEA
               and Asia Pacific regions resulted in a reduction in the
               consolidated gross margin percentage of approximately 110 basis
               points for the quarter. The lower in-line pricing margins
               related primarily to footwear and were due to strategies to
               improve consumer value, higher product costs due in part to
               higher oil prices and a shift in the mix of products sold in
               EMEA toward products with lower margins.

     (2)  A lower gross margin percentage in the U.S. Region accounted for
          approximately 20 basis points of decline to the consolidated gross
          margin improvement for the first quarter. The U.S. Region gross
          margin decline was due primarily to lower in-line pricing margins in
          footwear. Higher product costs (due in part to higher oil prices)
          and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand
          drove the lower U.S. Region footwear margins during the first
          quarter.

     (3)  Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses
          represented 20 basis points of improvement to the consolidated gross
          margin percentage for the quarter. Exeter Brands (a unit formed in
          August of fiscal 2005 to develop our business in retail channels
          serving value-conscious consumers) and Converse drove the majority
          of the gross margin improvement, reflecting increased revenues from
          their respective licensing businesses, which carry higher gross
          margins than the balance of our Other businesses.

     We have hedged the majority of product purchases for the remainder of
fiscal 2006 and a significant portion of those are at more favorable rates
than product purchases in fiscal 2005. Based on these known rates, we expect
hedge rates to continue to have a positive impact on our gross margin
percentage in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. For the remainder of the
year, we expect the greatest benefit to occur in the second quarter with
minimal impact in the second half of the year.

     These benefits from currency hedge rates are expected to be largely
offset by the impact of strategies to improve consumer value in EMEA and Asia
Pacific and higher product costs as discussed above.  Based on these factors,
we currently expect minimal gross margin improvement for the full fiscal year
2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

     Selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand creation
(advertising and promotion) and operating overhead, grew 3% for the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. One percentage point of
the increase for the first quarter was due to changes in currency exchange
rates.

     Demand creation expense decreased 10% to $421.6 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates,
demand creation expense decreased 11% in the first quarter. The decrease in
demand creation spending for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 is not
indicative of what we currently expect for the full year and was primarily
attributable to a change in the timing of advertising spending versus fiscal
2005. Advertising spending was particularly heavy in the prior year's first
quarter due to marketing programs centered on global sporting events that took
place in the summer of 2004. In addition, an advertising campaign scheduled
for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was delayed to the second quarter of the
year.

     Operating overhead for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 grew 12% to
$682.8 million. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage
point of the increase for the first quarter. Excluding the effects of
currency, operating overhead increases for the quarter were mainly
attributable to higher personnel costs due to increased headcount, higher
wages and benefits, and higher incentive-based compensation (6 percentage
points for the quarter); investments in infrastructure to support the growth
of our Other businesses (2 percentage points for the quarter); and continued
investments in NIKE-owned retail stores (1 percentage point for the quarter).

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, foreign currency hedge gains were
the most significant component of other income, net, of $9.9 million. These
gains are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-
tax income in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Note 8 - Operating Segments). The hedge gains in the first quarter
of fiscal 2006 reflect that the euro has weakened since we entered into these
hedge contracts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, foreign currency hedge
losses were the most significant component of other expense, net, and the
comparison of these foreign currency hedge losses to foreign currency hedge
gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 drove the year-over-year improvement
in other (income) expense, net.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimate that the combination of
net foreign currency gains in other (income) expense, net, and the favorable
translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in
EMEA, resulted in a year-over-year increase in consolidated income before
income taxes of $17 million. If current exchange rates remain constant, we do
not expect a significant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes
related to the combination of foreign currency gains or losses and the
translation of foreign currency denominated profits for the remainder of
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.

     The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the
expected effective tax rate for the full year of 34.5% is slightly lower than
the effective tax rate for the full year of fiscal 2005 of 34.9%. The decrease
in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a lower effective rate for U.S.
state taxes.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from September 2005 through January 2006 were 11.0%
higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2005. The
net effect from changes in currency exchange rates did not have a significant
impact on this reported increase versus the same period last year. Higher
average selling prices for footwear and apparel contributed 5 percentage
points of the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The remaining
increase was due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel. As always,
the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative
of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the
mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In
addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order
cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between
futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant
portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders,
including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale
sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan,
Converse, NIKE Golf, Hurley, Exeter Brands and retail sales across all brands.

     In the U.S. Region, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 grew
8% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2005, as revenues increased in each
product business unit (footwear, apparel and equipment).  The increase in
footwear revenue for the first quarter was due to a 7 percentage point
increase in unit sales and a 4 percentage point increase in the average
selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales and the average price per
pair are primarily due to increased consumer demand for performance
products, especially those with a suggested retail price over $100.

     The increase in apparel sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was
driven by volume increases in branded apparel, partially offset by declines
in the volume and average selling price per unit of licensed apparel. The
declines in both the volume and average selling price of licensed apparel
were primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA
in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

     For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, U.S. Region pre-tax income was
$345.2 million, a 7% increase versus the first quarter of fiscal 2005. For
the quarter, higher revenues drove the increase, more than offsetting a
lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative costs.
The lower gross margin percentage, which reduced the consolidated gross
margin percentage by approximately 20 basis points for the first quarter,
was primarily the result of lower in-line pricing margins for footwear due
to higher product costs and additional costs incurred to meet strong unit
demand, as discussed above. The higher selling and administrative costs were
due to increases in operating overhead, primarily the result of higher
personnel costs, and slightly higher demand creation expenses.

     For EMEA, changes in currency exchange rates accounted for 1 percentage
point of the reported revenue growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each product
business unit grew in the first quarter. The increase in footwear revenue
over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales, partially
offset by declines in the average selling prices due in part to strategies
to improve consumer value and changes in the mix of products sold. The
increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales. Sales
increases in the UK, Italy and the emerging markets in our Central Europe,
Middle East and Africa unit drove the growth.

     EMEA pre-tax income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $330.2
million, up 34% versus the prior year quarter. Higher revenues, gross margin
improvements and lower selling and administrative costs drove the increase.
The improved gross margins, which contributed approximately 80 basis points
of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage, were primarily the
result of improved year-over-year euro hedge rates partially offset by
reduced in-line pricing margins primarily in footwear. The reduced in-line
margins were due to the investments in consumer value, a shift in the mix of
products sold and higher product costs, as discussed above. The lower
selling and administrative costs were driven by decreases in demand creation
expense (resulting from lower advertising spending), partially offset by
increased operating overhead expense (primarily driven by increased
personnel costs).

     In the Asia Pacific Region, 3 percentage points of reported revenue
growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency
exchange rates. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in
each Asia Pacific business unit grew.  The increase over the prior year was
primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear and apparel. A
significant revenue increase in China (driven by expansion of retail
distribution and strong consumer demand) was the primary growth driver
for the quarter.

     Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region increased 44% in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to $91.4
million. Higher revenues, lower selling and administrative costs and a
slight benefit from changes in currency exchange rates were partially offset
by a reduction in the gross margin percentage. The reduced gross margin
percentage, which reduced the consolidated gross margin by approximately 20
basis points, was primarily attributable to lower in-line pricing margins
due to strategies to improve consumer value and higher product costs. The
lower selling and administrative costs were driven by decreases in demand
creation expense, primarily due to lower advertising spending in the first
quarter.

     In the Americas Region, 12 percentage points of the revenue growth for
the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency exchange
rates. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each
product business unit grew in the first quarter. The revenue growth for the
quarter was driven primarily by higher sales in Canada and South America.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, pre-tax income for the Americas
Region increased 119% from the prior year quarter, to $44.6 million. The
increase in pre-tax income for the first quarter was attributable to higher
revenues, an improved gross margin percentage and a benefit from changes in
currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher selling and
administrative costs. The improved gross margin percentage contributed
approximately 20 basis points to the growth of the consolidated gross margin
percentage for the quarter.

     Revenues and pre-tax income for our Other businesses in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 include results from Bauer NIKE Hockey Inc., Cole
Haan Holdings Incorporated, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE
Golf, and Exeter Brands Group LLC. For the first quarter, the increase in
Other revenues was primarily driven by growth at Converse and Cole Haan.

     Pre-tax income from the Other businesses was essentially unchanged at
$40.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as increased demand
creation investments in NIKE Golf offset profit growth in most of the Other
businesses.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Activity

     Cash provided by operations was $261.7 million for the first three
months of fiscal 2006, compared to $368.4 million for the first three months
of fiscal 2005. Net income provided $432.3 million of cash flow over the
first three months of the current year, compared to $326.8 million in the
first three months of last year, partially offset by a greater net increase
in working capital for the current year versus the prior year. In the first
three months of fiscal 2006, our net investment in working capital increased
primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories. The
increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects our revenue growth
across the Company, the extension of credit terms in China to a level
consistent with our other regions, and an extension of credit terms in
countries in Asia for products we shipped early due to the implementation
of new supply chain systems in July 2005. The increase in inventories
largely reflects our reported futures orders growth and is in part the
result of changes in the timing of receipts and shipments of products as
compared to the prior year.

     In the current quarter, we purchased approximately 1.8 million shares
of NIKE's Class B common stock for $150.6 million, bringing purchases to
date under the program to 8.7 million shares for $706.8 million. The share
repurchases were part of a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was
approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. We expect to continue to
fund this program from operating cash flow. The timing and the amount of
shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market
conditions.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock for the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 were $0.25, compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of fiscal
2005.

Capital Resources

     No amounts are currently outstanding under our committed credit facility.
The terms of our facility have not changed from those described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005.

     Our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings remain at A+ and A2 from
Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was no amount outstanding at August 31, 2005 or May 31, 2005. We
currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above and in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, will be
sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable
future.

Critical Accounting Policies

     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in
the accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on
our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual
results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical
accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect
working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue
recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory
reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These
policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial
statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is
relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally
known within the six-month period following the financial statement date.
Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts
across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.


Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2005.


Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

     The Company carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial
Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of August 31, 2005.

     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.


               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                             and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

                      RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
                                     OF
                                 NIKE, INC.

                       (as amended September 23, 2005)

     The following version of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of
NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Corporation"), has been prepared
for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and includes the
amendments reflected in the Articles of Amendment filed with the Oregon
Secretary of State on October 15, 1987, the Articles of Amendment filed
with the Oregon Secretary of State on October 10, 1995 and the Articles
of Amendment filed with the Oregon Secretary of State on September 23,
2005:

                                 ARTICLE I

     These Restated Articles of Incorporation supersede the previously
existing Articles of Incorporation of NIKE, Inc. and all amendments
thereto.

                                ARTICLE II

     The name of this Corporation is NIKE, Inc. and its duration shall
be perpetual.

                                ARTICLE III

     The purposes for which this Corporation is organized are to engage
in any lawful activity for which corporations may be organized under
ORS Chapter 57.

                                ARTICLE IV

     The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have the
authority to issue is divided as follows:

     A.     175,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value;

     B.     750,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, no par value;
and

     C.     300,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value.

     Immediately upon the filing of these Restated Articles of
Incorporation with the Corporation Commissioner for the State of Oregon,
each share of the Corporation's Common Stock, without par value,
outstanding immediately prior to such filing shall become, without
further action and without the necessity of transfer or exchange of any
share certificates, 30 shares of the Corporation's Class A Common Stock,
without par value, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to all of
the rights and preferences of such class of stock as set forth in these
Restated Articles of Incorporation.

     The Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Common Stock."  The designations,
preferences, limitations and relative rights granted to or imposed upon
the respective classes of the shares of capital stock and the holders
thereof are as follows:

     A.     Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value
            ________________________________

            1.     Dividends.  The holders of Preferred Stock shall be
                   _________
entitled to receive dividends at the rate of $.10 per share per annum
payable annually on May 31.  Dividends shall be cumulative.  Computation
of the amount of dividends accrued in respect of a fraction of a year
shall be on the basis of a 365-day year.  In case dividends for any
period are not paid in full, all shares of Preferred Stock shall
participate ratably in the payment of dividends for such period in
proportion to the full amount of such dividends for such period to which
they are entitled.  Unpaid dividends shall bear interest at the rate of
12 percent per annum.  No dividend shall be declared or paid or set
apart for payment in any fiscal year on the Common Stock or on any class
of stock of the Corporation ranking as to dividends subordinate to the
Preferred Stock, until all dividends for such fiscal year for all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been declared and paid, or
set apart for payment, in full.

            2.     Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise expressly
                   _____________
required by law, shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote
on any matter submitted to shareholders, other than matters listed below:

                  (a)   Sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

                  (b)   Merger, consolidation, liquidation or
dissolution of the Corporation.

                  (c)   Sale or assignment of the "NIKE" trademark for
athletic shoes sold in the United States.

     On any of the foregoing matters or on any matters as to which
voting of the Preferred Stock shall be expressly required by law, such
stock shall be entitled to one vote per share, and it shall vote as a
separate class.

     If any such matter is submitted for approval by Preferred
Shareholders and is not approved by the holders of more than 66-2/3
percent of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, the Corporation
and the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the following rights and
obligations:

                 (a)   Holders of Preferred Stock voting against the
action may require the Corporation to redeem all of its shares of
Preferred Stock by giving written notice to the Corporation and stating
that the shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation
on a specified date, which may not be less than 60 days from the date of
the notice.  The redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus accrued
dividends and interest, if any.

                 (b)   The Corporation may redeem any or all of the
shares of Preferred Stock voting against the action by giving written
notice to the holders of Preferred Stock and stating in such notice that
the shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation on a
specified date, which may not be more than 60 days from the date the
notice is given.  The redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus
accrued dividends and interest, if any.

     3.     Liquidation.  The holders of Preferred Stock shall be
            ___________
entitled to receive, before any payment or distribution of the assets of
the Corporation, whether capital or surplus, shall be made to or set
apart for the holders of the Common Stock or any other series or class
of stock ranking junior to such Preferred Stock as to rights upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
voluntarily or involuntarily, $1.00 per share, together with all
dividends declared and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution,
and no more.  If, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the assets of the Corporation distributable among the
holders of Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the
preferential amount aforesaid, then such assets shall be distributed
among such holders ratably in proportion to the full amounts which would
be payable on said shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in
full.  Neither the merger nor consolidation of the Corporation into or
with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other
corporation into or with the Corporation, nor a sale, transfer or lease
of all or any part of the assets of the Corporation shall be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within
the meaning of this paragraph.

     4.     Redemption by the Corporation.  The Corporation, at its
            _____________________________
option, may redeem shares of Preferred Stock in any one or more of the
following situations:

            (a)   The Corporation may redeem all, but not less than all,
of the shares of Preferred Stock by giving written notice to the holders
of Preferred Stock and stating in such notice that the shares of
Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation on a specified date
which shall not be more than 90 days from the date the notice is given.
The redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends
and interest, if any.  At the time of any redemption under this
paragraph A.4.(a) of Article IV, in addition to paying the redemption
price, the Corporation shall repay the entire indebtedness owed by the
Corporation to the holders of Preferred Stock.

            (b)   If a holder of Preferred Stock desires to sell or
transfer the Preferred Stock (to any person other than Nissho Iwai Co.,
Ltd. or one of its subsidiaries), the Corporation may redeem the
Preferred Stock proposed for sale.  The redemption price shall be $1.00
per share, plus accrued dividends and interest, if any.

                 (i)   In the event of a proposed sale or transfer, the
holder of Preferred Stock shall notify the Corporation of its intention
to sell or transfer the Preferred Stock and provide the Corporation with
the name of the proposed transferee and the terms of the transfer.  If
the Corporation chooses to exercise its right to redeem, the Corporation
shall give the holder of Preferred Stock written notice of its intention
to redeem within 15 days from the date the Corporation receives notice
of the holder's proposed sale or transfer.  Any such redemption notice
by the Corporation will provide for redemption no more than 60 days from
the time such redemption notice is given by the Corporation to the
holder of Preferred Stock.

                (ii)   If a holder of Preferred Stock sells or transfers
Preferred Stock, any transferee shall be subject to the redemption
rights set forth in these Articles.

          (c)   In the event that the Supply Agreement executed by the
Corporation and Nissho Iwai American Corporation on October 7, 1976, is
terminated by either party, the Corporation may redeem by giving written
notice to the holders of the Preferred Stock and stating in such notice
that the shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed on a specified date
which shall not be more than 60 days from the date such notice is given.
The redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends
and interest, if any.

     Notice of any proposed redemption of shares of Preferred Stock
shall be given by the Corporation by mailing a copy of such notice to
the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed, at their respective
addresses as appearing on the books of the Corporation.

     5.     Redemption by Holder.  In the event that the Supply
            ____________________
Agreement executed by the Corporation and Nissho Iwai American
Corporation on October 7, 1976, is terminated by either party, the
holders of the Preferred Stock may redeem by giving written notice to
the Corporation and stating in such notice that the shares shall be
redeemed on a specified date which shall not be less than 60 days from
the date such notice is given.  The redemption price shall be $1.00 per
share, plus accrued dividends and interest, if any.

     B.     Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.
            _____________________________________________

           1.     Voting Rights.  Subject to the rights granted herein
to the Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock shall possess
all of the voting power of the capital stock of this Corporation.  All
such shares shall have one vote per share and shall vote together as one
class except as provided in this Article IV, Section B, subsection 1, or
as may otherwise be required by law.

     At any time that the number of outstanding shares of the Class B
Common Stock shall equal or exceed 25 percent of the total outstanding
shares of Common Stock, determined as of the record date established for
the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to vote, the shares of
the Class A and Class B Common Stock shall vote separately for the
purpose of electing directors.  At any such time, the holders of the
Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to
elect a number of directors equal to 25 percent (rounded up to the
nearest whole number) of the total number of authorized directors.  The
holders of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall
elect all remaining members of the Board of Directors.  The two classes
shall continue to vote separately for the election of directors as long
as the outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock represent 25
percent or more of the total outstanding Common Stock.

     Without regard to the above provisions relating to class voting for
directors, if at any time the number of outstanding shares of the Class
A Common Stock shall be less than 12.5 percent of the total outstanding
Common Stock, the holders of the Class B Common Stock shall continue to
elect, voting as a separate class, 25 percent (rounded up to the nearest
whole number) of the total number of authorized directors, and the
holders of the Class A Common Stock and the holders of the Class B
Common Stock shall elect all remaining members of the Board of Directors,
voting together as a single class.

     In any vote for the removal of a director from office, the shares
of the Class A and Class B Common Stock shall vote together and as one
class, except that a director elected by the vote of either the Class A
Common Stock or the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class,
or a director appointed to fill the vacancy left by a director who was
elected by separate class vote, may be removed from office only upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of the class which elected him or his predecessor.

     Nothing within this Article IV concerning voting rights is intended
to modify or otherwise affect the voting provisions which are contained
in Article VI of these Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

     2.     Conversion Rights of the Class A Common Stock.
            _____________________________________________

            Subject to the following terms and conditions, each share of
Class A Common Stock shall be convertible into a fully paid and
nonassessable share of the Class B Common Stock.  At the option of the
respective holders, up to 1,017,000 shares of Class A Common Stock which
will be outstanding upon the filing with the Oregon Corporation
Commissioner of these Restated Articles of Incorporation shall be
convertible at any time, and all remaining shares shall be convertible
at any time from and after the 90th day following the effective date
under the Securities Act of 1933 of the Corporation's Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October
1980.  The conversion ratio shall be one share of Class B Common Stock
for each share of Class A Common Stock surrendered for conversion.  Such
conversion rights shall include and be subject to the following:

            (a)     Conversion may be affected as to all or any whole
number of shares evidenced by any certificate for shares of Class A
Common Stock upon surrender of such certificate to the Corporation at
its principal office or to such agent or agents as may be designated by
the Board of Directors.  Shares so surrendered for conversion shall be
accompanied by written evidence of the holder's election to convert such
shares and (if so requested by the Corporation) accompanied by an
instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the holder of his duly authorized attorney.

           (b)     As promptly as practicable after the surrender of the
shares for conversion in the manner herein provided, the Corporation
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holder of the shares so
surrendered, certificates representing the number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of the Class B Common Stock of the Corporation into
which such shares of Class A may be converted together with (if the
certificate for the shares of Class A surrendered includes shares which
are not being converted) certificates representing the number of shares
of Class A Common Stock not then being so converted.  Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made as soon as the shares of the Class A
Common have been surrendered for conversion in the manner herein
provided, so that the rights of the holder of the shares of Class A
Common so surrendered shall cease at such time and the person entitled
to receive the Class B Common Stock upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such
shares of Class B Common Stock at such time; provided, however, that no
such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the
Corporation shall be closed or after the record date shall have been set
shall be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Class B Common Stock upon conversion of their
shares of Class A Common Stock as the record holder or holder of such
shares of Class B Common Stock on such date, but rather such shares
shall retain the rights of Class A Common Stock until after the event
for which the record date was set or the transfer books were closed.

           (c)     The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep
available for issue upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock such
number of its authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock as
will be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of
the Class A Common Stock.

           (d)     In the case of any reclassification of the
outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock, or in the case of any
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
corporation, the result of which is that shares of Class B Common Stock
become convertible into or entitled to receive securities or other
property different from that which shares of Class A Common Stock then
outstanding shall have the right thereafter to convert any of such
shares into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities
which a holder of that number of shares of the Class B Common Stock into
which such shares are convertible received or is entitled to receive.

           (e)     At no time shall the record date be set for any vote
by the shareholders of the Corporation upon any merger, consolidation,
sale of substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any other
event which under the Oregon Business Corporation Act is required to be
submitted to the shareholders for a vote without first providing not
less than 10 days' prior written notice of such date and event to the
registered holders of the Class A Common Stock as shown on the books of
the Corporation, if as a part of such transaction the shares of the
Class B Common Stock are to be treated differently or to be entitled to
different rights than the shares of the Class A Common Stock.

     3.     Other Rights.  All rights to which holders of capital stock
            ____________
are entitled and which are not expressly granted to the Preferred Stock
under this Article are reserved to and vested in the Common Stock.  In
all respects other than voting, which rights are set forth hereinabove,
the shares of the Class A and the Class B Common Stock shall have
identical rights, provided that no stock dividend, stock split or other
issuance of shares by the Corporation without consideration shall
without express authorization of the Board of Directors result in the
shares of one class of stock becoming entitled to receive shares of the
other.  No stock dividend, stock split or other issuance of shares
without consideration shall be effected by the Corporation with respect
to either class of Common Stock except such action as shall affect both
classes of stock ratably on a share-for-share basis.  There shall be no
preference between shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of Class B
Common Stock with respect to dividends or the rights to proceeds upon
liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation.

                               ARTICLE V

     The authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be
seven, provided that such number may be increased (or decreased to not
less than 5) by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Vacancies on the
Board may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors,
including any vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors,
provided that no vacancy created by the resignation, removal from office
or death of a director who was elected by a separate class vote of the
Common Stock shall be filled by the Board of Directors, except upon the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors similarly
elected by such class.  If none shall be remaining, the vacancy shall be
filled by the remainder of the directors.

                              ARTICLE VI

     A.     The affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80
percent of all outstanding Common Stock, voting as one class, shall be
required for the approval or authorization of any "business combination"
(as hereafter defined) with any person or entity which, as of the record
date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice
thereof and to vote thereon, is the beneficial owner of 10 percent or
more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation.  Any such 80
percent vote in order to constitute due and valid authorization under
this Article must include not less than 50 percent of the Common Stock
held by persons other than the person or entity interested in such
transaction.
     B.     The term "business combination" shall mean
            1.   any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation with or into any other person or entity;
            2.   the sale of substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation to any other person or entity; or
            3.   any other transaction with such person or entity for
which approval of the shareholders of this Corporation is required by
law or by any agreement between the Corporation and any national
securities exchange.
     C.     The foregoing voting requirements shall not be applicable to
any business combination approved by resolution of the Board of
Directors prior to any such shareholder vote, provided that the
resolution received the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors
elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders (including any
replacements for such directors who were appointed by the board), or to
any business combination solely between the Corporation and any other
corporation or entity in which 50 percent or more of the voting stock or
interest is owned by the Corporation.
     D.     Beneficial ownership for purposes of this Section shall be
deemed to include all shares which would be determined to be
beneficially owned (whether directly by such person or entity or
indirectly through any affiliate or otherwise) under Rule 13d-3 of the
Securities and Exchange Commission as in effect on the date of filing of
these Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Oregon Corporation
Commissioner as well as all shares of the Corporation which the other
entity has the right to acquire, pursuant to any agreement or otherwise.
     E.     The determination of whether a proposed business combination
is within the scope of this Article VI, including without limitation,
the determination of whether such other party beneficially owns 10
percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation for
purposes of this Article VI, shall be made by the Board of Directors.
Such determination shall, if made in good faith, be binding upon all
parties.
     F.     The shareholder vote, if any, required for any business
combination not expressly subject to the supermajority voting provisions
of this Article VI shall be such vote as may otherwise be required by
applicable law.

                             ARTICLE VII

     Articles V and VI, and this Article VII, of these Restated Articles
of Incorporation may not be amended except upon the affirmative vote of
80 percent of the outstanding Common Stock.

                            ARTICLE VIII

     A.     The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify to the
fullest extent not prohibited by law any person who is made or
threatened to be made a party to, witness in, or otherwise involved in,
any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative, legislative, formal or informal, internal or external or
otherwise (including an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or a fiduciary
within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Corporation, or
serves or served at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent or as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan,
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise.  Any indemnification provided pursuant to this Article VIII
shall not be exclusive of any rights to which the person indemnified may
otherwise be entitled under any articles of incorporation, bylaw,
agreement, statute, policy of insurance, vote of shareholders or Board
of Directors, or otherwise, which exists at or subsequent to the time
such person incurs or becomes subject to such liability and expense.

     B.     To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, no director of
the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director.  No
amendment or repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any
provision of these Restated Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with
this Article VIII, nor a change in the law, shall adversely affect any
right or protection that is based upon this Paragraph B and pertains to
conduct that occurred prior to the time of such amendment, repeal,
adoption or change.  No change in the law shall reduce or eliminate the
rights and protections set forth in this Paragraph B unless the change
in the law specifically requires such reduction or elimination.  If the
Oregon Business Corporation Act is amended after this Article VIII
becomes effective to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors of the Corporation, then
the liability of directors of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Oregon Business
Corporation Act as so amended.

                            ARTICLE IX

     (1)     No contract or other transaction between the Corporation
and one or more of its directors or any other corporation, firm,
association or entity in which one or more of its directors are
directors or officers or are financially interested, shall be either
void or voidable because of such relationship or interest or because
such director or directors are present at the meeting of the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies
such contract or transaction or because his or their votes are counted
for such purpose, if:
            (a)     The fact of such relationship or interest is
disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or committee which
authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction by a vote
or consent sufficient for the purpose without counting the votes or
consents of such interested directors; or
            (b)     The fact of such relationship or interest is
disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they
authorize, approve or ratify such contract or transaction by vote or
written consent; or
            (c)     The contract or transaction is fair and reasonable
to the Corporation.
     (2)     Common or interested directors may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes or ratifies such
contract or transaction.
     This Article shall not invalidate any contract or other transaction
which would otherwise be valid under applicable law.

                             ARTICLE X

     No holder of any class of stock of the Corporation now or hereafter
authorized shall have any preemptive or preferential right of
subscription to or otherwise be entitled to acquire any shares of any
class of stock of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized,
or to any obligation convertible or exchangeable into stock of the
Corporation, or any right, option or warrant of subscription to any of
the foregoing, other than such, if any, as may be specifically
authorized by, pursuant to the authority hereby given, the Board of
Directors.

                            ARTICLE XI

     The stated capital of the Corporation at the time of the adoption
of these Restated Articles of Incorporation is $489,000.

an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

    a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information; and

    b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
over financial reporting.
