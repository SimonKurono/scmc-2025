Basis of Presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial 
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations 
for the three and nine months ended February 28, 1997 are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 
 
     Net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average 
number of common and common equivalent (stock option) shares outstanding 
for the period(s). 
 
     During the second quarter, the Company issued additional shares in 
connection with a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% 
stock dividend on outstanding Class A and Class B common stock.  The per 
common share amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
accompanying notes have been adjusted to reflect this stock split.

         _____________________________ 
 
     There have been no other significant subsequent developments 
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the 
Company's most recent Form 10-K.  

NOTE 5 - Change in year-end of certain subsidiaries: 
         __________________________________________ 
 
     Prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of the Company's international 
operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag
which allowed more time to compile results.  The Company has taken steps 
to improve its internal reporting procedures that has allowed for
more timely reporting of these operations.  Beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.  As a 
result, the May 1996 loss from operations for these entities of 
$4.1 million was recorded directly to retained earnings in the first
quarter of the current year. The income and cash flow statements 
have been presented to show comparable results for the quarter and 
year as if the change had occurred in the prior year.  The effect 
of the change is not material to the consolidated balance sheet and as a 
result the balance sheet as of May 31, 1996 has not been adjusted. 
 
NOTE 6 - Long-term debt: 
         ______________ 
 
     In December of 1996, the Company issued $200 million seven-year 
notes, maturing December 1, 2003.  The proceeds were subsequently 
swapped into Dutch Guilder and loaned to a European subsidiary.  Interest 
on the loan is paid semi-annually at a fixed Dutch Guilder rate of 5.64%. 
 
     As of June 27, 1996, the Company's Japanese subsidiary borrowed 10.5 
billion Japanese yen in a private placement with a maturity of June 26, 
2011.  Interest is paid semi-annually at 4.3%.  The agreement provides 
for early retirement after year ten.  
 
 
 
ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULT OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
 
     Net income increased 77% over the prior year's third quarter and 55% on 
a year-to-date basis.  For the quarter, in comparison to last years third 
quarter, the increase in net income was attributed primarily to an 
increase in revenues of 53% (to a record $2.4 billion), an increase in 
gross margin percentage from 39.7% to 40.8% and improved leverage of 
selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues.  For the 
nine months ended February 28, 1997, net income was up 55% over the 
same period last year, driven by an increase in revenues of 47% and 
an improved gross margin percentage. 
 
     NIKE brand revenues increases for the quarter and year-to-date, compared 
with the same periods last year, were driven by the strength of the brand on 
a global basis. U.S apparel increases for the quarter and year-to-date were 
driven by increases in training, accessories and kids' categories. U.S. 
footwear for the quarter increased $313.6 million or 47%, due to an increase 
of 34% pairs sold and an 10% increase in average selling prices. Nearly every 
footwear category experienced increases.  For the year, the largest category 
increases in terms of total dollars were men's basketball, up 47%, women's 
fitness, up 60%, kids' footwear, up 60%, and men's running, up 73%.  Other 
categories showing large percentage increases included golf and soccer. 
 
     All regions outside the U.S. experienced significant revenue increases 
for the quarter and year-to-date.  For the quarter, Europe increased 62%, 
(footwear up 48% and apparel up 105%), Asia Pacific increased 76% (footwear 
up 69% and apparel up 95%) and the Americas increased 64% (footwear up 51% 
and apparel up 131%).  The top two countries, in terms of revenue, Japan and 
United Kingdom, increased 86% and 94%, respectively. Each would have 
increased more than 100% had exchange rates remained the same as the 
prior year.  The total impact of exchange rates on the quarter's revenue 
was to decrease it by $64 million, or 11%. For the year, rates have decreased 
revenues by $157 million, or 10%. 
 
 
The breakdown of revenues follows:

    *For comparable purposes with 1996, results for the three and nine 
months ended February 29, 1996 have been adjusted and reflect the 
elimination of the one month lag in reporting by certain of the Company's 
international operations. See further discussion under Note 5. 
 
     The increase in gross margin percentage for the quarter compared with 
the same period last year is most significantly attributable to the U.S. 
Footwear and Europe businesses.  The increase in U.S. Footwear's gross margin 
percentage is due primarily to price increases and changes to product mix.  
Europe continues to experience the benefits of centralized distribution 
centers. Gross profit percentages for the remainder of fiscal year 1997 are 
expected to continue to be affected by both strong demand for NIKE products 
and increased prices compared with last year, offset by increased levels of 
air freight to meet the delivery dates on increasing customer orders.  At 
this time, Management expects the percentage for the full year to be more 
in line with last fiscal year's percentage.* 
 
     The reduction in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of 
revenues for the quarter can be attributed primarily to the significant 
increase in revenues.  The largest areas of spending increases relate to 
advertising, marketing and infrastructure costs.  At this time, Management 
expects selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for 
the remainder of the year to be at levels slightly higher than the prior 
year.* 
 
     Interest expense increased for both the quarter and year-to-date over 
the prior year due to increased short term borrowings and new long-term debt 
in the U.S. and Japan in order to fund growing operations. Other 
(income)/expense, net decreased due to increased interest income and less
conversion loss on foreign transactions, offset by increased profit share 
expense. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 38.75% 
compared to 38.5% in the prior year.  The slight increase is due primarily 
to higher state income taxes on U.S. earnings.  At this time, Management 
anticipates the tax rate for fiscal 1997 will remain at approximately 
38.75%.* 
 
     Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from March 1997 through July 1997 were approximately 
$4.3 billion, 34% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period 
of the prior year.  These orders and the percentage growth in these orders 
are not necessarily indicative of the growth in revenues which the Company 
will experience for the subsequent periods.  This is because the mix of 
advance futures and "at once" orders has shifted significantly toward 
futures orders as the NIKE brand became more established in all areas, 
specifically in the U.S. apparel business and in international regions.  
The mix of advance orders to "at once" orders will continue to vary as the 
U.S. apparel business and international operations continue to account for 
a greater percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on 
futures programs.*   Finally, exchange rates can cause differences in the 
comparisons.* 
 
     As further explained in Note 5, prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of 
the Company's international operations reported their results of operations 
on a one month lag which allowed more time to compile results.  The Company 
has taken steps to improve its internal reporting procedures that has 
allowed for more timely reporting of these operations.  Beginning in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.  As 
a result, the May 1996 results of operations for these entities of $4.1 
million loss was recorded to retained earnings.  The income statement and 
cash flow has been presented to show comparable results for the quarter as 
if the change would have occurred in the prior year.  Throughout this 
discussion, comparisons for last year are stated as they would have appeared 
had these entities reported on a same month basis.  
 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
_______________________________ 
 
     The Company's financial position remains strong at February 28, 1997.  
Since May 31, 1996, total assets grew $993 million to $4.9 billion and 
shareholders' equity increased $583 million to $3.0 billion.  Working capital 
increased $637 million, and the Company's current ratio increased to 2.2 at 
February 28, 1997 from 1.9 at May 31, 1996.  
 
     Changes in other working capital components totaled $701 million, due 
primarily to significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory. 
Since May 31, 1996, accounts receivable increased $504 million or 37%, 
due to higher levels of revenues compared with the fourth quarter of the 
prior year. Inventory levels increased $158 million from May 31, consistent 
with the growth of the business.  U.S. inventory levels increased $57 million 
on U.S. footwear's $44 million increase.  U.S. footwear inventory turns 
increased to 9.1 from 8.1 at May 31,1996.  Outside of the U.S., inventory 
increased $92 million in the Asia Pacific region, the majority of the 
increase coming from the Company's Japanese subsidiary due to revenue 
growth.  Consolidated inventory turns increased to 5.3 compared to 5.0 at 
May 31, 1996.  All other components of working capital changed only slightly 
compared to May 31, 1996.  An increase in other current assets was offset by 
an increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments. 
 
      Additions to property, plant and equipment in the U.S. totaled $206 
million for the first three quarters of fiscal 1997 due to the continued 
overall expansion of U.S. operations which included warehouse locations 
and the continued development of NIKE Town retail stores.  Additions to 
property, plant and equipment outside of the U.S. accounted for $86 million 
of the $318 million total. The most significant increase relates to 
expansion of the European warehouses. In addition to the increases in 
property, plant and equipment, other assets increased from May 31, 1996, 
due primarily to advance payments made in fiscal 1997 for long-term 
endorsement contracts.  
 
     Cash was provided from financing activities through an increase of 
$289 million in long-term debt to fund growing operations, including 
infrastructure.  In December, 1996, the Company issued $200 million 
seven-year notes, maturing December 1, 2003.  The proceeds were subsequently 
swapped into Dutch Guilders and then loaned to a European subsidiary. Proceeds 
from this intercompany loan will be used by the subsidiary to retire 
short-term debt. This debt issuance, along with the 10.5 billion Japanese 
yen (approximately $100 million) borrowed by the Company's Japanese 
subsidiary in the first quarter, account for the majority of the increase 
in long-term debt. 
 
     The Company's commercial paper program requires the support of 
committed and uncommitted lines of credit.  The Company borrows against 
its commercial paper program and, at February 28, 1997, there was $158 
million outstanding.  The Company has $500 million available in committed, 
unused lines of credit and, at quarter-end, no amounts were outstanding 
under this credit facility. NIKE's debt-to-equity ratio at February 28, 
1997 remained constant from May 31 at 0.6. 
 
     Management believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources and long-term debt arrangements, will 
continue to adequately finance anticipated fiscal 1997 expenditures.*
