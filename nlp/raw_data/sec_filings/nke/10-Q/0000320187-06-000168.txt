       NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         __________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 2006 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in the Company's financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The provisions of FIN 48
are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FIN 48.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.  The provisions of FAS 157 are
effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008.  The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("FAS 158"). FAS
158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with
single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other
postretirement plans in their financial statements.  The provisions of FAS 158
are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 158.

NOTE 6 - Stock-Based Compensation
         ________________________


     In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved,
the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1990 Plan"). The 1990 Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 66 million previously unissued shares of
Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted
under the plan.  The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses and
the issuance and sale of restricted stock. The exercise price for non-
statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights and the grant price of
restricted stock may not be less than 75% of the market price of the
underlying shares on the date of grant. The exercise price for incentive stock
options may not be less than the market price of the underlying shares on
the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990
Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom
awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and
conditions of the awards. The committee has granted substantially all stock
options at 100% of the market price on the date of grant.  Substantially all
grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan vest ratably over four years and expire
10 years from the date of grant.

     In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to
purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock
purchase plans ("ESPPs").

     On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R "Share-Based Payment"
("FAS 123R") which requires the Company to record expense for stock-based
compensation to employees using a fair value method. Under FAS 123R, the
Company estimates the fair value of options granted under the 1990 Plan and
employees' purchase rights under the ESPPs using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model.  The Company recognizes this fair value as selling and
administrative expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method.

     The following table summarizes the effects of applying FAS 123R during
the three months ended August 31, 2006. The resulting stock-based compensation
expense primarily relates to stock options.

1  In accordance with FAS 123R, included in the total $40.8 million, net of
tax, stock-based compensation expense reported during the three months ended
August 31, 2006, is $22.2 million, net of tax, or $0.09 per diluted share, of
accelerated stock-based compensation expense recorded for employees eligible
for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Because the Company
usually grants the majority of stock options in a single grant in the first
three months of each fiscal year, under FAS 123R accelerated vesting will
normally result in higher expense in the first three months and lower expense
in each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.


     As of August 31, 2006, the Company had $209.3 million of unrecognized
compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be
recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average
period of 1.9 years.

     The Company has adopted the modified prospective transition method
prescribed by FAS 123R, which does not require the restatement of financial
results for previous periods. In accordance with this transition method,
beginning with the three months ended August 31, 2006, the Company's
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income includes (1) amortization
of outstanding stock-based compensation granted prior to, but not vested, as
of June 1, 2006, based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
("FAS 123") and (2) amortization of all stock-based awards granted subsequent
to June 1, 2006, based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of FAS 123R.

     Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value
method to account for stock options and ESPP shares in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" as permitted by FAS 123. If the Company had instead
accounted for stock options and ESPP shares to employees using the fair value
method prescribed by FAS 123 during the three months ended August 31, 2005,
the Company's pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share would have
been reported as follows:

1  Accelerated stock-based compensation expense for options subject to
accelerated vesting due to employee retirement is not included in the pro
forma figures shown above for the three months ended August 31, 2005.  This
disclosure reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated
vesting period or upon actual employee retirement.  Had the Company recognized
the fair value for such stock options on an accelerated basis in this pro
forma disclosure, an additional $18.7 million, net of tax, or $0.07 per
diluted share would be recognized in the disclosure.

     The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during
the three months ended August 31, 2006 and 2005 as computed using the Black-
Scholes pricing model was $17.54 and $19.36, respectively.  The weighted
average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows:

     Expected volatility is estimated based on the implied volatility in
market traded options on the Company's common stock, with a term greater than
one year. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an
analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns.  The interest
rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in
effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term
of the options.

     The following summarizes the Company's stock option transactions during
the three months ended August 31, 2006:

     The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above was the amount by which
the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the
options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the
three months ended August 31, 2006 and 2005 was $16.8 million and $42.4
million, respectively.

NOTE 7 - Earnings Per Common Share:
         _________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase 15.4 million and 5.7
million shares of common stock were outstanding at August 31, 2006 and
August 31, 2005, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the options were antidilutive.

NOTE 8 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions for operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity excluding
NIKE Golf and NIKE Bauer Hockey.  Each NIKE brand geographic segment operates
predominantly in one industry:  the design, production, marketing and selling
of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. The "Other" category
shown below represents activities of Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, Converse
Inc., Exeter Brands Group LLC, Hurley International LLC, NIKE Bauer Hockey
Inc., and NIKE Golf, which are considered immaterial for individual disclosure
based on the aggregation criteria in SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information".

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents income before income taxes as shown in the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Reconciling items for pre-tax
income represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting including corporate activity, stock-based
compensation expense, certain currency exchange rate gains and losses on
transactions, and intercompany eliminations for specific income statement
items in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Accounts receivable, net, inventories, and property, plant and equipment,
net for operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided
below.

NOTE 9 - Commitments and Contingencies:
         _____________________________

     At August 31, 2006, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling $177.3 million.  These letters of credit were issued primarily for
the purchase of inventory.

     There have been no other significant subsequent developments
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, our revenues grew 9% to $4.2
billion, net income declined 13% to $377 million and diluted earnings per
share were $1.47, a 9% decrease compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
These reported results included a $61.3 million charge, before taxes, related
to stock-based compensation expense now recognized in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123R "Share-Based
Payment," ("FAS 123R") which we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal
2007.  See further discussion of the adoption of FAS 123R in Note 6 - Stock-
Based Compensation in the accompanying Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding this charge, our net income
declined 3 percentage points and diluted earnings per share were $1.63, a 1%
increase versus the first quarter of fiscal 2006. For the quarter, our
consolidated gross margin percentage declined 120 basis points to 44.1%,
primarily due to lower in-line net pricing margins (net revenue for current
product offerings minus landed product costs) for footwear. Increased demand
creation spending in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 also contributed to the pre-tax income decline in the
quarter and reflected increased spending on advertising and sports marketing
events, primarily around the global World Cup and Nike Air (registered)
campaigns.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, changes in currency exchange rates,
primarily the stronger euro, increased the consolidated revenue growth by 2
percentage points. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, our
international regions contributed approximately 3 percentage points of the
consolidated revenue growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2007,as all three
of our international regions posted higher revenues. The U.S. region
contributed 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for the
first quarter of fiscal 2007. Sales in our Other businesses drove the balance
of the improvement for the quarter. Revenues for our Other businesses are
comprised substantially of results from Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated,
Converse Inc., Exeter Brands Group LLC, Hurley International LLC, NIKE Bauer
Hockey, Inc., and NIKE Golf.

</TABLE>
        In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, our consolidated gross margin
percentage declined 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2006.
The primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for
the first quarter of 2007 were as follows:

     (1)  Lower footwear in-line net pricing margins due to:

          -   additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear demand in the
              U.S. region;

          -   higher sales incentives, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and
              Africa ("EMEA") and Asia Pacific regions;

          -   strategies to improve consumer value in EMEA;

          -   overall higher product costs, primarily the result of higher
              labor costs and oil prices; and

          -   a shift in the mix of footwear models sold from higher margin
              models toward those with lower margins, most notably in EMEA;

     (2)  Higher third party royalty costs driven by increased sales of team-
          endorsed soccer apparel.

     These factors were partially offset by improved gross margin percentages
in our Other businesses driven primarily by NIKE Bauer Hockey, NIKE Golf, and
Converse, offset by a decline at Exeter.

    1 This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation

      Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, this schedule is
      provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends
      excluding this identifiable expense by presenting our results for the
      first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the same accounting policy for stock-
      based compensation expense applied during the first quarter of fiscal
      2006.

    2 This charge relates to stock-based compensation associated with stock
      options and ESPP shares issued to employees and expensed in accordance
      with FAS 123R.  We adopted FAS 123R on June 1, 2006 using the modified
      prospective transition method. While this expense was not reflected in
      our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, it will
      continue to be reflected in future accounting periods.

    3 Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including
      costs of endorsement contracts.

     Changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative
expense by 1 percentage point in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to
the prior year.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, demand creation expense increased 19
percentage points over the prior year due to increased spending on advertising
and sports marketing events, primarily associated with the global World Cup and
Nike Air (registered) campaigns. In addition, demand creation expense was
particularly light in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting a greater
concentration of advertising later in that year.

     Excluding stock-based compensation expense, operating overhead increased
6 percentage points, a lower rate of growth than revenue.  The increase in
operating overhead was mainly attributable to higher wages and benefits;
increased spending to support the growth of NIKE-owned retail, primarily
related to new stores; and increased spending to support the growth of our
Other businesses.

</TABLE>

     The reduction in Other income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2007
compared to the prior year was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge
losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to foreign currency hedge
gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, more than offset by a benefit from
a favorable settlement of the previously disclosed Converse arbitration. The
hedge losses and gains are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment
presentation of pre-tax income, and the Converse arbitration settlement is
reflected in the Other line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in
the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 8 -

    Futures Orders

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from September 2006 through January 2007 were 6%
higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2006.
This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual
exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period,
which approximate current spot rates.  The net effect from changes in currency
exchange rates improved this reported increase by 0.5 percentage points versus
the same period last year. Unit sales volume increases for both footwear and
apparel contributed more than 4 percentage points of the growth in overall
futures and advance orders. The remaining increase was due to higher average
selling prices for footwear and apparel. The reported futures and advance
orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue
growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift
between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate
fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts
can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders,
and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not
derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and closeout sales
of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team
apparel, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey,
NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands.

     The increase in U.S. footwear revenue for the first quarter of fiscal
2007 was due to increases in both unit sales and average selling price per
pair. The increase in units sold was driven by increased consumer demand for
our Brand Jordan and Nike brand sport culture products. The higher average
selling price per pair reflected increased consumer demand for higher priced
sport performance and NIKE brand sport culture products.

     The increase in U.S. apparel revenues for the first quarter of fiscal
2007 was driven by increased unit sales, primarily NIKE brand sport
performance apparel, as well as an increase in average selling prices,
driven by NIKE brand sport performance and Brand Jordan apparel.

     The decrease in the U.S. region pre-tax income in the first quarter of
fiscal 2007 reflected higher selling and administrative expenses and a lower
gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the
result of lower in-line pricing margins for footwear attributable to
additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand and higher
product costs. Selling and administrative costs increased as a result of
higher demand creation spending around the World Cup and Nike Air (registered)
campaigns as well as an increase in operating overhead expense, driven by
increased spending for new NIKE-owned retail stores and expected annual
increases in wages and benefits.

     For the EMEA region, changes in currency exchange rates increased
revenue growth by 3 percentage points in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in our Central
Europe, Middle East and Africa unit led the revenue growth, offset by a
decline in the U.K. The decline in footwear revenue reflected decreased
unit sales and a slight decline in the average selling price per pair. The
decreased unit sales of footwear reflected lower demand resulting from the
difficult retail environment, most notably in the U.K., offset by increased
demand for sport culture products across the rest of the region. The decline
in the average selling price per pair was due in part to changes in the mix
of in-line products sold towards products with a lower average selling
price, and higher sales incentives as a result of the difficult retail
environment mentioned above. The increase in EMEA apparel revenue was driven
by increased unit sales and average selling prices of NIKE brand apparel,
primarily sport performance products.

     The decrease in EMEA pre-tax income for the first quarter of fiscal
2007 was driven by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and
administrative costs more than offsetting higher revenues and favorable
foreign currency translation compared to the prior year. The lower gross
margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in-line net pricing
margins in footwear as well as higher third party royalty costs driven by
increased sales of team-endorsed soccer apparel, partially offset by
improved year-over-year euro hedge rates. The lower in-line net pricing
margins in footwear were due to higher product costs, primarily the result
of increased labor costs and higher oil prices, higher sales incentives,
strategies to improve consumer value, and a shift in the mix of footwear
models sold from models with higher margins towards models with lower
margins. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, selling and
administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2007 were higher than in the
first quarter of 2006 driven primarily by higher demand creation spending
around the World Cup and NIKE Air (registered) campaigns. Operating overhead
expense increased slightly, due primarily to expected annual increases in
wages and benefits.

     In the Asia Pacific region, changes in currency exchange rates did not
have a significant impact on revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2007
compared to the prior year. Footwear revenue growth reflected increased unit
sales, partially offset by lower average selling prices, due primarily to
strategies to improve consumer value in Japan. The increase in apparel
revenues was driven primarily by increased demand for sport performance
products, particularly related to the World Cup, as well as increased demand
for sport culture products. Revenues increased in almost all countries. China
was the primary growth driver for the quarter due to retail distribution
expansion coupled with strong consumer demand.

     The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific region in the first
quarter of fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues partially offset by
increased selling and administrative expenses. Changes in currency exchange
rates increased pre-tax income by 1 percentage point. The gross margin
percentage remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Demand
creation spending around the World Cup drove the increase in selling and
administrative expenses while operating overhead spending remained
consistent with the prior year.

</TABLE>

     In the Americas region, 3 percentage points of the revenue growth for
the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Excluding the changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
sales in each Americas product business unit grew in the first quarter. The
revenue growth for the quarter was driven primarily by increased sales in
nearly every country in the region, with significant sales increases in
Argentina and Mexico offset by sales declines in Brazil as we respond to a
shift in consumer preferences to sport culture products.

     The increase in pre-tax income for the Americas region in the first
quarter of fiscal 2007 was attributable to higher revenues, an improved
gross margin percentage, and favorable foreign currency translation
partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The
increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both
demand creation spending, primarily around the World Cup campaign, as well
as increased operating overhead expense driven by increased wages and
benefits and costs incurred for the implementation of new supply chain
systems in the region.

     The increase in Other business revenues for the first quarter of fiscal
2007 was driven by higher revenues across every business, most notably NIKE
Golf and NIKE Bauer Hockey in addition to the wholesale business expansion
at Exeter.

     Pre-tax income from the Other businesses in the first quarter of fiscal
2007 increased 120 percentage points as compared to the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 and included a $14.2 million benefit resulting from the final
settlement of the previously disclosed arbitration ruling involving Converse
and a former South American licensee. Excluding the Converse arbitration
settlement benefit, the pre-tax income improvement was attributable to
higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage, most notably at
NIKE Bauer Hockey, NIKE Golf, and Converse.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Activity

     Cash provided by operations was $231.8 million for the first quarter of
fiscal 2007, compared to $261.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal
2006. Our primary source of operating cash flow for the first quarter of
fiscal 2007 was net income of $377.2 million offset by an increased
investment in working capital to support growth in the business.  The
increased investment in working capital over the first quarter of fiscal
2006 was largely due to an increase in inventories which reflects our
business growth driven by futures and at once order growth, early product
ordering to optimize factory capacity, a market slowdown primarily in EMEA,
and an increase in replenishment business.

     Cash provided by investing activities was $584.1 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $69.3 million for the first quarter of
fiscal 2006.  The increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to higher net
maturities of short-term investments (maturities net of purchases).

     Cash used by financing activities was $751.9 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 2007, an increase of $613.7 million from the first quarter
of fiscal 2006.  The increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the $250
million repayment of corporate bonds and an increase in share
repurchases, as discussed below.

     In the current quarter, we purchased 6.0 million shares of NIKE's Class
B common stock for $476.7 million. During the quarter, we completed the
previous four-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the
Board of Directors in June 2004 and started repurchasing shares under the
Company's new four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program approved by the
Board of Directors in June 2006.  As of the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 2007, the Company had purchased 4.0 million shares for $314.1 million
under the new $3 billion program. We expect to fund share repurchases from
operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of
shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market
conditions.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock for the first quarter of
fiscal 2007 were $0.31, compared to $0.25 in the first quarter of fiscal
2006.

Contractual Obligations

     As a result of renewals and additions to outstanding endorsement
contracts, the cash payments due under our endorsement contracts have

</TABLE>

     The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate
amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are
obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual
payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these
contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon
athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods.
Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts
include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in
future periods.

     In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the
endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine
how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts
do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The
amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors
including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which
they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing
initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase
the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time
and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for
products sold to customers.

Capital Resources

     No amounts are currently outstanding under our committed revolving credit
facility. The terms of our facility have not changed from those described in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006.

     Our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings remain at A+ and A2 from
Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was no amount outstanding at August 31, 2006 or May 31, 2006. We
currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above and in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, will be
sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable
future.


Recently Issued Accounting Standards

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The provisions of FIN 48 are effective
for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the
impact of the provisions of FIN 48.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The
provisions of FAS 157 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1,
2008.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. "Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("FAS 158").
FAS 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated
with single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other
postretirement plans in their financial statements.  The provisions of FAS
158 are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. We
are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 158.

Critical Accounting Policies


     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in
the accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on
our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. With the adoption of FAS 123R at the beginning of the first
quarter of fiscal 2007, we have added "Stock-based Compensation" as a
critical accounting policy as described below.  Actual results could differ
from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent
payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make
estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date.
However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results
related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period
following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally
affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.

     Stock-based Compensation

     As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R,
the fair value of stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes fair value model. The Black-Scholes option pricing
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in
market traded options on the Company's common stock, with a term greater than
one year.  Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the
availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment
that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends
than historical volatility.  If factors change and we use different
assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods,
stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that
recorded in the current period.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2006.

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

     The Company carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial
Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of August 31, 2006.

     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

1.  I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of NIKE, Inc.;

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement

materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,

employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
over financial reporting.
