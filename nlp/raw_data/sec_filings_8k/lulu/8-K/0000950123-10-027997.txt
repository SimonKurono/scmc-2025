</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Constant-dollar net revenue changes, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates,
is not a United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (&#147;GAAP&#148;) performance measure. We provide
constant-dollar net revenue changes because we use the measure to understand the underlying growth
rate of revenue excluding the impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis of changes in foreign exchange
rates, which are not under management&#146;s direct control. We believe that disclosing net revenue
changes on a constant-dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better
understand the level of growth of our business.

Securities Act of 1933 and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or
results of operations, our prospects and strategies for future growth, the development and
introduction of new products, and the implementation of our marketing and branding strategies. In
many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148;
&#147;expects,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;outlook,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;intends,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;predicts,&#148;

statements are based on management&#146;s current expectations but they involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those
anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, which
include, without limitation: the possibility that we may not be able to manage operations at our
current size or manage growth effectively; risks that consumer spending may continue to decline
and that U.S. and global macroeconomic conditions may worsen; the possibility that levels of
comparable-store sales or average sales per square foot will decline; the possibility that we may
not be able to successfully expand in the United States and other new markets; increased
competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our
marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; the possibility that we may not be able
to continually innovate and provide our consumers with improved products; the possibility that our
suppliers or manufacturers may not produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective
manner; and other risk factors detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
