</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;26, 2007, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
that we entered into on April&nbsp;26, 2007 with our stockholders, Lululemon Athletica USA Inc., a
Nevada corporation (&#147;<U>Lulu USA</U>&#148;) Lululemon Athletica Inc., a company formed under the laws
of British Columbia (&#147;<U>Lulu Canada</U>&#148;), Lulu Canadian Holding, Inc., a company formed under
the laws of British Columbia (&#147;<U>Lulu Canadian Holding</U>&#148;), LIPO Investments (Canada) Inc. a
company formed under the laws of British Columbia (&#147;<U>LIPO Canada</U>&#148;), LIPO Investments (USA)
Inc., a company formed under the laws of British Columbia (&#147;<U>LIPO USA</U>&#148;), Dennis Wilson, in
his individual capacity and in his capacity as trustee pursuant to a trust arrangement established
for the benefit of the minority stockholders and option holders of LIPO Investments (Canada) Inc.,
LIPO Investments (USA)&nbsp;Inc., and Slinky Financial ULC, an Alberta unlimited liability company (the
&#147;<U>Reorganization Agreement</U>&#148;) were completed. The information contained in Item&nbsp;5.03
regarding amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the
number of our authorized shares and effect a forward stock split is incorporated herein by
reference.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement and the
forward stock split contemplated by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on July&nbsp;26, 2007, we issued an aggregate of 44,290,778
shares of our common stock and 20,935,041 shares of our special voting stock. In addition, Lulu
Canadian Holding, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, issued 20,935,041 exchangeable shares.
Holders of these exchangeable shares will be entitled, at any time, to exchange their exchangeable
shares for an equal number of shares of our common stock (subject to anti-dilution provisions
attaching to such shares).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;26, 2007, pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we also issued options to purchase
4,479,069 shares of our common stock at a weighted average per share exercise price of $0.58 in
exchange for the surrender and cancellation of outstanding options to purchase shares of stock of
Lulu USA and Lulu Canada. The options issued pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement are subject
to the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the foregoing sales and issuances of
securities was exempt from registration under the
Securities Act in reliance on Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof or Regulation&nbsp;D promulgated thereunder relating
to sales not involving a public offering, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;701 promulgated under the Securities
Act, as transactions pursuant to compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation
as provided under Rule&nbsp;701, or pursuant to Regulation&nbsp;S promulgated under the Securities Act,
with respect to the securities offered and sold outside the United States to investors who are not
residents of the United States. At
the time the Reorganization Agreement was entered into, the stockholders were
committed to acquire the shares described in this Item&nbsp;3.02, subject only to conditions
outside their control. As a result, the sale of the securities thereunder is
deemed to have been completed for securities law purposes as of
April&nbsp;26, 2007. No underwriters were involved in the sales described in this Item
3.02 and the certificates representing the securities issued contain legends restricting the
transfer of the securities without registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption
from registration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;26, 2007, we filed with the Delaware Secretary of State an amendment to our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation, pursuant to which we increased the number of authorized
shares of our capital stock from 40,750,000 to 205,750,000 shares, consisting of 200,000,000 shares
of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 5,750,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par
value per share, issuable in series. Of the shares designated as preferred stock, 250,000 shares
were designated as Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, 250,000 shares were designated as Series&nbsp;B Preferred
Stock and 250,000 shares were
designated Series&nbsp;TS Preferred Stock. The foregoing increase in authorized capital was
effective upon filing with the Delaware Secretary of State.

preceding paragraph, we filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the
Delaware Secretary of State. As provided in this amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, effective as of 11:15 pm Eastern time on July&nbsp;26, 2007, (i)&nbsp;our Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Stock, Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock and Series&nbsp;TS Preferred Stock were eliminated from our authorized
capital, (ii)&nbsp;a new class of capital stock was authorized and was designated as &#147;Special Voting
Stock&#148; and (iii)&nbsp;a 2.38267841-for-1 forward stock split of our common stock was consummated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 11:15 pm Eastern time on July&nbsp;26, 2007, we were authorized to issue 235,000,000 shares

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our special voting shares are intended to be issued to holders of exchangeable shares of Lulu
Canadian Holding. Holders of special voting shares will be able to vote in person or by proxy on
any matters put before holders of our common stock at any stockholders meeting. Each special
voting share carries one vote. Such votes may be exercised for the election of directors and on
all other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Our special voting shares do not
entitle their holders to receive dividends or distributions from us or to receive any consideration
in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. To the extent exchangeable shares are
exchanged for shares of our common stock, a number of special voting shares as corresponds to the
number of exchangeable shares thus exchanged will be cancelled without consideration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the stock split and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
