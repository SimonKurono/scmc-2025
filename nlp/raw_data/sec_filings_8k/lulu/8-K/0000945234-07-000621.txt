</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;15, 2007, the Board of Directors of lululemon athletica inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) increased
the size of the Board of Directors from eight to nine members and appointed Michael Casey to fill
the newly-created vacancy. Mr.&nbsp;Casey will serve as a member of the class of directors whose terms
expire at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until such time as his successor is duly
elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation or removal. The Board of Directors has
determined that Mr.&nbsp;Casey is &#147;independent&#148; as contemplated by The Nasdaq Stock Market and other
governing laws and applicable regulations. Mr.&nbsp;Casey will also serve as a member of the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors. Mr.&nbsp;Casey&#146;s compensation for his service as a director will
be consistent with that of the Company&#146;s other non-employee directors, as described in the
Company&#146;s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September
5, 2007, except that for fiscal 2007 he will receive a pro rata portion of the annual retainer and
restricted stock unit and option grants based on the number of months in which he serves as a
director in fiscal 2007. Mr.&nbsp;Casey will also enter into the standard form indemnification
agreement for directors and certain officers (which was previously filed as Exhibit&nbsp;10.16 to the
Company&#146;s Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S&#8209;1 dated July&nbsp;9, 2007, Registration No.&nbsp;333-142477).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr.&nbsp;Casey and any other person pursuant to which
he was selected as a director. There are no relationships between Mr.&nbsp;Casey and the Company or its
subsidiaries that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation&nbsp;S&#8209;K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A copy of the press release issued by the Company on October&nbsp;17, 2007, announcing Mr.&nbsp;Casey&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This press release contains &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or
results of operations, our prospects and strategies for future growth, the development and
introduction of new products, and the implementation of our marketing and branding strategies. In
many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148;
&#147;expects,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;intends,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;predicts,&#148; &#147;potential&#148; or
the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are
based on management&#146;s current expectations but they involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the
forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, which include, without
limitation: the possibility that we may not be able to manage operations at our current size or
manage growth effectively; the possibility that we may not be able to locate suitable locations to
open new stores or attract customers to our stores; the possibility that we may not be able to
successfully expand in the United States and other new markets; the possibility that we may not be
able to finance our growth and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow; increased competition
causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts
in order to avoid losing market share; the possibility that we may not be able to effectively
market and maintain a positive brand image; the possibility that we may not be able to maintain
recent levels of comparable store sales or average sales per square foot; the possibility that we
may not be able to continually innovate and provide our consumers with improved products; and the
possibility that our suppliers or manufacturers may not produce or deliver our products in a timely
or cost-effective manner; and other risk factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (&#147;the SEC&#148;), including Risk Factors contained in our final prospectus relating
to our initial public offering filed included in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (file no.
