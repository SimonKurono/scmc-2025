NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 2003 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2004 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 2 - Inventories:
         ___________

NOTE 3 - Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill:
         ___________________________________________

     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," (FAS 142) effective June 1, 2002.  In
accordance with FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
will no longer be amortized but instead will be measured for impairment at
least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists.
Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will continue to
be amortized over their useful lives.

     The following table summarizes the Company's identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill balances as of August 31, 2003 and May 31, 2003:

NOTE 5 - Stock-Based Compensation:
         _________________________

     The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" as permitted by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (FAS 123). The Company's policy is to grant stock options with
an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of grant, and
accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized.

     If the Company had accounted for stock options issued to employees in
accordance with FAS 123, the Company's pro forma net income (loss) and pro
forma earnings (loss) per share would have been reported as follows:

     The pro forma effects of applying FAS 123 may not be representative of
the effects on reported net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for

made each year.

NOTE 6 - Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share:
         ________________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings (loss) per
share to diluted earnings (loss) per share.  Options to purchase 3.9 million
and 4.3 million shares of common stock were outstanding at August 31, 2003 and
August 31, 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings (loss) per share because the options' exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the
effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 7 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions with operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity.  Each NIKE
brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:  the design,
production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and
equipment. The "Other" category shown below represents activities of Cole Haan
Holdings, Inc., Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE
Golf, which are considered immaterial for individual disclosure.

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations. Effective June 1, 2003 the assets,
liabilities, and operating expenses of NIKE IHM, Inc., which primarily
manufactures NIKE Air components, have been reclassified to the Corporate
category from Other, reflecting current management of these operations.  NIKE
IHM, Inc. information for the applicable prior year period has been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of
accounting change as shown in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Operations.  Reconciling items for pre-tax income represent corporate costs
that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting and
intercompany eliminations for specific items in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

     Accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment for
operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided below:

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies
_________________________

     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved
in the accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section
of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest
potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to
be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty
inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the
estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain
of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve
for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and
contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies
require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial
statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is
relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are
generally known within the six-month period following the financial
statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing
of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are
not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
that would result in materially different amounts being reported.


Operating Results
_________________

     -  Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 8% to $3.0
        billion versus $2.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

     -  Gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues for the first
        quarter of fiscal 2004 to 43.0% from 41.4% for the first quarter of
        the prior year.

     -  Selling and administrative remained relatively consistent as a
        percentage of revenues at 28.7% versus 28.8% for the first quarter of
        the prior year.

     -  Income increased 20% for the quarter to $261.2 million from $217.2
        million for the prior year, before the cumulative effect of accounting
        change in the first quarter of the prior year.  After the effect of
        the accounting change, the first quarter of fiscal 2003 had a net loss
        of $48.9 million.

     -  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 21% to $0.98 from
        $0.81 in the prior year before the cumulative effect of accounting
        change.  After the effect of the accounting change, the first quarter
        of fiscal 2003 had a loss of $0.18 per diluted share.

     A 15% increase in revenue from our international regions drove a majority
of the 8% increase in consolidated revenues.  Changes in currency exchange
rates, primarily the euro, contributed approximately six and one-half
percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth. See further discussion
of revenues in the regional commentary below.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, our consolidated gross margin
percentage improved 160 basis points versus the prior year, from 41.4% to
43.0%, our highest quarterly gross margin percentage in our history as a
public company. Factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage
in the quarter were as follows:

        (1)  Higher pricing margins for in-line products, which represents
             current product offerings, resulted from lower product costs due
             to manufacturing efficiencies, reduced material costs, and lower
             air freight as well as a higher mix of sales of classic footwear
             models.
        (2)  A reduced level of closeout sales as a percentage of total sales
             and improved margins on those sales.
        (3)  Changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro.

     Selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand creation and
operating overhead, grew 8% versus the prior year quarter, and as a percentage
of revenue, remained relatively consistent with the prior year. Demand
creation expense grew 1% to $324.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004
from $321.8 million in fiscal 2003, reflecting a six percentage point increase
due to changes in currency exchange rates.  Excluding the impact of currency,
demand creation spending declined versus the first quarter of fiscal 2003
mainly due to costs of our World Cup marketing campaign incurred in the first
quarter of last year.

     Operating overhead increased 13% to $545.5 million in the first quarter
of fiscal 2004 from $483.0 million in fiscal 2003. Currency exchange rates
contributed five percentage points of the increase.  Excluding the effects of
currency, operating overhead increases were attributed to higher reserves for
bad debts in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, operating
costs of new factory outlet stores outside the U.S., costs related to our on-
going development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply
chain initiative and increased costs to support the growth of our NIKE Golf,
Cole Haan and Hurley businesses.

     Other expense, net was $23.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004
compared to $11.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.  Beginning this
fiscal year, interest income and profit sharing expense previously included in
other expense, net, are included in interest expense, net and selling and
administrative, respectively. The presentation of prior year amounts has been
adjusted to conform to the current classification. The majority of the
increase over the prior year is due to loss on disposal of land gifted to the
NIKE Foundation and legal settlement costs.  The largest component of other
expense, net, comprising approximately half of this year's net expense, is
foreign currency losses primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges
to a European subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro. These losses
are comparable to last year and are reflected in the Corporate line in our
segment presentation of pre-tax income in Note 7 - Operating Segments. The
hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we
entered into these hedge contracts.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, net foreign currency losses in other
expense, net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign
currency denominated profits, which resulted in higher translated earnings in
our foreign operations, most significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the net
impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a $34 million addition
to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year period.
Consistent with our existing policies, we have also hedged a portion of
anticipated intercompany charges for the balance of fiscal 2004. As the euro
has strengthened since these hedge contracts were executed, we expect to
continue to incur some hedge losses for the balance of fiscal 2004. However,
at current exchange rates, we expect the net impact of the hedge losses and
the offsetting positive translation impact will result in a net benefit to
fiscal 2004 consolidated net income versus the prior year.

     Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was 34.8%,
relatively consistent with the first quarter of fiscal 2003 rate of 35.0%, but
higher than the full year rate for fiscal 2003 of 34.1%.  This increase
compared to fiscal 2003 anticipates higher taxes on foreign earnings.

     Included in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 net income was a $266.1
million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
(FAS 142). This charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks
associated with Bauer NIKE Hockey and the goodwill of Cole Haan, reflecting
that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying
values. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 4 -
Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
as of May 31, 2003 for further information.

     Our largest international region, EMEA, reported 17% revenue growth in
the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. This growth
reflected a 19 percentage point improvement due to changes in currency
exchange rates. Excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates
apparel revenues were down due to the mix of product sold.  Key drivers of the
change in mix were a shift in the timing of the launch of the Manchester
United away jersey from the first quarter into the second quarter, and
increased sales of lower priced spring and summer products as the region
experienced unseasonably warm summer weather. Both the footwear and equipment
business units in EMEA delivered revenue growth versus the prior year.

     EMEA pre-tax income grew 26% to $204.7 million in the first quarter of
fiscal 2004 up from $162.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Higher
revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase, more than offsetting
incremental selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margins were
primarily the result of changes in currency exchange rates and higher in-line
pricing margins in footwear.

     In the Asia Pacific region, revenues increased 13% in the first quarter
of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.  Four percentage points of this growth
were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the benefit from
changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Asia Pacific business unit
grew, as did sales in almost every country of the region.  The region's growth
was led by significant increases in China and Korea, driven by expansion of
retail distribution and consumers' acceptance of our products, as well as
continued growth experienced in Japan.

     Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific region increased to $76.7 million in
the first quarter of fiscal 2004 up from $50.7 million in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003. This increase reflected higher revenues, improved gross margins
and lower selling and administrative costs.  The improved gross margins were
the result of higher in-line margins across footwear, apparel and equipment.
Lower selling and administrative costs were driven mainly by a reduction in
demand creation spending compared to the expenses incurred in the prior year
relating to the 2002 World Cup.

     In the Americas region, revenues increased 8% for the quarter, with two
percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Excluding the effects from changes in currency exchange rates, the revenue
growth was driven by stronger consumer demand in South and Central America,
while sales in Mexico were essentially flat and down in Canada due to lower
consumer demand. Excluding the currency exchange rate impact, the region
experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly
offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, pre-tax income for the Americas
region declined slightly versus the prior year quarter, to $24.3 million. The
decline in pre-tax income was attributable to reduced gross margins due to
less favorable hedge rates on product purchases in Mexico, combined with
market pressure on product pricing in that market.

     In the U.S. Region, revenues were down 2% in the first quarter of fiscal
2004 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2003. U.S. footwear revenues were
down 5% and equipment revenues were down 4%, more than offsetting sales growth
in U.S. apparel. The increase in U.S. apparel sales of 5% was primarily driven
by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel. Lower footwear
revenues were due to reduced sales to our largest customer, Foot Locker,
partially offset by increased sales to other accounts, which resulted from the
significant changes in our U.S. footwear distribution that began in fiscal
2003.  These changes were previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form
10-K as of May 31, 2003.

     A portion of the footwear revenue decline for the first quarter was
attributable to a lower average price per pair reflecting a higher percentage
of sales of classic footwear and kids' models, which have lower average prices
than our complex adult performance models.  However, U.S. footwear futures
orders scheduled for delivery from September 2003 to January 2004 reflect
increases in both total amount and average price per pair versus the
comparable year-ago period.

     U.S. region pre-tax income increased to $295.6 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 from $283.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal
2003. Pre-tax income improved, despite lower revenues and slightly higher
selling and administrative expense, due to improved gross margins across all
business units, most significantly footwear.  The improved gross margins were
mainly due to higher in-line pricing margins and a reduced level of close out
sales with improved margins on those sales.

     Other revenues and pre-tax income include results from Bauer NIKE Hockey,
Inc., Cole Haan Holdings, Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE Golf.
Other revenues grew 32% in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal
2003 due to growth in each of these businesses, most significantly NIKE Golf.

     Other pre-tax income improved to a loss of $3.2 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 from a loss of $11.2 million in fiscal 2003.  Improved
results of NIKE Golf drove the year-over-year improvement.

     The breakdown of revenues follows:

     The previous discussion includes disclosure of "pre-tax income" for our
operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating
segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." As
discussed in Note 7 - Operating Segments in the attached Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax
income of our operating segments.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from September 2003 to January 2004 were 10.5% higher
than such orders reported in the comparable period of fiscal 2003. Three
points of this reported increase were due to changes in currency exchange
rates versus the same period last year. In addition, approximately four to
five points of this growth can be attributed to an earlier start of the spring
season for footwear sales in Europe. As always, the reported futures orders
growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth
during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between
advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as
well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the
comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a
significant portion of our revenues is not derived from futures orders,
including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Bauer NIKE
Hockey, Cole Haan, NIKE Golf, Hurley, and retail sales across all brands.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
_______________________________

     Cash provided by operations was $350.7 million in the first quarter of
fiscal 2004, compared to $174.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
Our primary source of operating cash flow in the current quarter was net
income of $261.2 million.  The year-over-year increase in cash provided by
operations was due primarily to changes in our investment in working capital.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, our net investment in working capital
increased by $102.7 million, reducing cash flow from operations for that
quarter.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, our net investment in working
capital decreased by $13.4 million, increasing cash flow for the quarter.

     Total cash used by investing activities during the current quarter was
$42.3 million, compared to $50.1 million in the prior year period.  Investing
activities are consistent with the prior year and primarily reflect capital
expenditures in computer equipment and software to support both normal business
operations as well as our supply chain initiative, and continued investment in
NIKE-owned retail stores.

     Net cash provided by financing activities for the first quarter was $49.5
million versus net cash used of $249.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal
2003.  During the current quarter, the principal drivers of cash provided by
financing activities were an increase in notes payable from the issuance of
commercial paper, partially offset by share repurchases. In the prior year,
decreases in notes payable, and share repurchases were the major uses of cash
for financing activities.

     The share repurchases were part of a $1 billion share repurchase program
that began in fiscal 2001.  In the current quarter, we purchased approximately
1.7 million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $89.5 million.  To date
under the program, we have purchased 14.0 million shares for $675.2 million.
We expect to continue to fund this program from operating cash flow. The
timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital
needs and stock market conditions.

     As a result of the above, our cash balance increased by $363.8 million
during the quarter as we prepared to fund our acquisition of Converse Inc.,
which was completed on September 4, 2003 for approximately $305 million.

     No amounts are currently outstanding under our committed credit
facilities.  The terms of our facilities have not changed from those described
in our Form 10-K as of May 31, 2003.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was $124.8 million outstanding at August 31, 2003 and no amount
outstanding at May 31, 2003.

     Our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings remain at A and A2 from
Standard and Poor's Corporation (S&P) and Moody's Investor Services (Moody's),
respectively.  Our short-term debt ratings remain at A1 and P1 from S&P and
Moody's, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to
meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock for the first quarter of
fiscal 2004 were $0.14 per share.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2003.

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

     The Company carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer, to
evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, as of August 31,
2003 the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level.

     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.


               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                             and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.


                           Part II - Other Information

Item 1.

Legal Proceedings

     Except as described below, there have been no material changes from the
information previously reported under Item 4 of the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003.

     On September 12, 2003 the Company settled the lawsuit, Kasky v. NIKE,
Inc. et al., No. 994446, filed in 1998 in San Francisco County Superior Court.
As part of the settlement, we agreed to make an additional contribution of
$1.5 million to the Washington, D.C. based Fair Labor Association for program
operations and worker development programs focused on education and economic
opportunity over the next three years.  We also agreed to maintain existing
funding of our after-hours worker education programs in footwear facilities
and micro-loan programs at a minimum of $500,000 over the next two years. The
case has been dismissed with prejudice (which means the plaintiff cannot
refile the action).
