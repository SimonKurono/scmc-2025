Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
 
     The first quarter ended August 31, 1995 established new 
record highs for revenues and net income.  Revenues increased 38% 
to $1.615 billion, compared to $1.170 billion in the prior year's 
first quarter.  Net income was $165 million, or $2.26 per share, 
compared to $106 million, or $1.43 per share for the same period 
in the prior year.  The 55% increase in net income was due to the 
record revenues as well as a decrease in selling and administrative 
expenses as a percent of revenues, from 25% in the prior year 
to 22.3% in the current year. 
 
     Revenues increased $444 million over the record $1.2 billion 
reported in the same period of the prior year.  U.S. footwear 
increased $136 million, or 21%, resulting from an increase of 
19% in pairs shipped and a 2% increase in average selling price due 
to sales mix.  Revenues increased in all U.S. footwear categories.  
U.S. apparel was up $88 million over last year's first quarter, an 
increase of 93%.  International revenues increased $131 million, or 
36%, composed of 33% and 48% increases in international (n0n-U.S.) 
footwear and apparel revenues, respectively.  The international 
growth included a 6% increase resulting from new NIKE subsidiaries 
and a positive 8% affect from foreign exchange translation.  All 
other brands, which includes Cole Haan (R), Tetra Plastics, Sports 
Specialties and Canstar Sports, increased during the quarter, however 
the primary increase was due to $75 million in revenues from Canstar 
Sports, which was acquired in the third quarter of the prior fiscal 
year.  The breakdown of revenues follows:

     Consolidated gross margins were relatively flat at 40.1% 
compared to 40.2% in the prior year.  Strong demand for NIKE 
products combined with sound inventory management resulted in 
stable NIKE brand margins.  The Company continues to place 
strong emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign 
exchange risk, and production sourcing in order to maximize 
gross profit. 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $67 million in 
absolute dollars over the previous year's first quarter, however, as 
a percent of sales decreased 2.7 percentage points to 22.3%.  The 
largest increase in absolute dollars was $29 million from international, 
with $12 million a result of exchange rates, $5 million from new 
subsidiaries, and the remainder due to increased levels of operations. 
U.S. NIKE brand operations were up $22 million, primarily in planned 
marketing expenses.  Canstar Sports added $12 million of expenses. 
The Company anticipates that total fiscal 1996 selling and 
administrative expense as a percent of revenues will 
approximate the prior year. 
 
     Interest expense for the quarter increased $6.6 million over 
the prior year due to increased short term borrowings for both U.S. 
and international operations.  Other income decreased 
$9.2 million, primarily as a result of increased goodwill expense, 
increased profit share plan expense and decreased interest income.  
Goodwill expense and interest income were most significantly affected 
by the acquisition of Canstar Sports. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.5% 
compared to 39.0% in the prior year. This is primarily due to 
lower taxes provided on non-U.S. earnings.  The Company anticipates 
the tax rate for fiscal 1996 will approximate 38.5%. 
 
     Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from September 1995 through January 1996 were 
approximately $2.3 billion, 32% higher than such orders booked in 
the comparable period of the prior year.  These orders are not 
necessarily indicative of total revenues for subsequent periods 
because the mix of advance orders and "at once" shipments may vary 
significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.  Additionally, 
as international operations continue to shift to a greater emphasis on 
futures orders, this mix again may vary.  Finally, exchange rates can 
cause differences in the comparisons. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
     The Company's financial position remains strong, with working 
capital rising $119 million since May 31, 1995.  The working capital 
ratio remained the same as of May 31, 1995 at 1.9:1. 
 
     Cash and equivalents decreased $38 million from May 31, 1995. 
Cash provided by operations was reduced by increases in working capital 
components.  Other significant uses of cash included 
additions to property, plant and equipment, decreases in short 
term borrowings and long term debt. 
 
     The increase in working capital components was primarily due 
to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by 
increases in accounts payable and taxes payable.  The increase in 
accounts receivable of $139 million was due to sales growth in both 
July and August over last May's comparable two month period. Overall 
inventories increased $47 million in conjunction with levels of 
operations, primarily due to U.S. apparel and international footwear 
and apparel inventories which have increased $18 million and $58 
million, respectively.  U.S. footwear inventories decreased $29 million 
due to record shipments and timing of inventory receipts.  Increases in 
accounts payable and taxes payable are a result of the increased level 
of operations. 
 
     The additions to property, plant and equipment were composed 
of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European 
footwear warehouses, expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and 
acquisition of land adjacent to the world headquarters. 
 
     The Company also utilized cash to reduce short term debt 
outstanding 
at May 31, 1995 and to retire long term debt acquired in the purchase 
of Canstar Sports. 
 
     During the quarter, the Company purchased 200,000 shares of 
its own stock under the stock repurchase program announced in 
July 1993, bringing the total number of shares purchased in the 
program to approximately 5,149,000. 
 
     In September of 1995, the Company's Board of Directors announced 
a two-for-one stock split following shareholder approval an 
increase in the number of authorized Class A and Class B Common 
shares.  The stock split will be in the form of a 100 percent 
stock dividend to be paid on October 30, 1995 to shareholders of 
record on October 9, 1995. 
 
     The debt to equity ratio at August 31, 1995 was .6:1 compared 
to .6:1 at May 31, 1995 and .4:1 at August 31, 1994.  Management 
believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources, will adequately finance anticipated 
fiscal 1996 expenditures, with the potential exception of the stock 
repurchase program discussed above.  At August 31, 1995, the Company 
had $300 million available in committed unused lines of credit.

     The name of this Corporation is NIKE, Inc. and its duration shall 
be perpetual. 
 
                                 ARTICLE III 
 
     The purposes for which this Corporation is organized are to engage 
in any lawful activity for which corporations may be organized under ORS 
Chapter 57. 
 
                                  ARTICLE IV 
 
     The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have the 
authority to issue is divided as follows: 
 
     A.     110,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value; 
 
     B.     350,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, no par value; and 
 
     C.     300,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value. 
 
     Immediately upon the filing of these Restated Articles of Incorporation 
with the Corporation Commissioner for the State of Oregon, each share of the 
Corporation's Common Stock, without par value, outstanding immediately prior 
to such filing shall become, without further action and without the necessity 
of transfer or exchange of any share certificates, 30 shares of the 
Corporation's Class A Common Stock, without par value, and the holders 
thereof shall be entitled to all of the rights and preferences of such class 
of stock as set forth in these Restated Articles of Incorporation. 
 
     The Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock are sometimes 
collectively referred to herein as the "Common Stock."  The designations, 
preferences, limitations and relative rights granted to or imposed upon the 
respective classes of the shares of capital stock and the holders thereof are 
as follows: 
 
     A.     Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value 
 
          1.     Dividends.  The holders of Preferred Stock shall be 
entitled to receive dividends at the rate of $.10 per share per annum 
payable annually on May 31.  Dividends shall be cumulative.  Computation 
of the amount of dividends accrued in respect of a fraction of a year shall 
be on the basis of a 365-day year.  In case dividends for any period are not 
paid in full, all shares of Preferred Stock shall participate ratably in the 
payment of dividends for such period in proportion to the full amount of such 
dividends for such period to which they are entitled.  Unpaid dividends shall 
bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum.  No dividend shall be 
declared or paid or set apart for payment in any fiscal year on the Common 
Stock or on any class of stock of the Corporation ranking as to dividends 
subordinate to the Preferred Stock, until all dividends for such fiscal year 
for all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been declared and paid, or 
set apart for payment, in full. 
 
          2.     Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise expressly required by 
law, shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter 
submitted to shareholders, other than matters listed below: 
 
               (a)     Sale of all or substantially all of the assets of 
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. 
 
               (b)     Merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of 
the Corporation.
 
               (c)     Sale or assignment of the "NIKE" trademark for 
athletic shoes sold in the United States. 
 
     On any of the foregoing matters or on any matters as to which voting 
of the Preferred Stock shall be expressly required by law, such stock shall 
be entitled to one vote per share, and it shall vote as a separate class. 
 
     If any such matter is submitted for approval by Preferred Shareholders 
and is not approved by the holders of more than 66-2/3 percent of the shares 
of Preferred Stock outstanding, the Corporation and the holders of Preferred 
Stock shall have the following rights and obligations: 
 
               (a)     Holders of Preferred Stock voting against the action 
may require the Corporation to redeem all of its shares of Preferred Stock 
by giving written notice to the Corporation and stating that the shares of 
Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation on a specified date, 
which may not be less than 60 days from the date of the notice.  The 
redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends and 
interest, if any. 
 
               (b)     The Corporation may redeem any or all of the shares 
of Preferred Stock voting against the action by giving written notice to 
the holders of Preferred Stock and stating in such notice that the shares 
of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation on a specified 
date, which may not be more than 60 days from the date the notice is given.  
The redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends and 
interest, if any. 
 
     3.     Liquidation.  The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled 
to receive, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the 
Corporation, whether capital or surplus, shall be made to or set apart 
for the holders of the Common Stock or any other series or class of stock 
ranking junior to such Preferred Stock as to rights upon liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, voluntarily 
or involuntarily, $1.00 per share, together with all dividends declared 
and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution, and no more.  If, 
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets 
of the Corporation distributable among the holders of Preferred Stock shall 
be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid, then such 
assets shall be distributed among such holders ratably in proportion to the 
full amounts which would be payable on said shares if all amounts payable 
thereon were paid in full.  Neither the merger nor consolidation of the 
Corporation into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or 
consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Corporation, 
nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of the assets of the 
Corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding 
up of the Corporation within the meaning of this paragraph. 
 
     4.     Redemption by the Corporation.  The Corporation, at its 
option, may redeem shares of Preferred Stock in any one or more of the 
following situations: 
 
          (a)     The Corporation may redeem all, but not less than 
all, of the shares of Preferred Stock by giving written notice to the 
holders of Preferred Stock and stating in such notice that the shares 
of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation on a specified d
ate which shall not be more than 90 days from the date the notice is 
given.  The redemption price shall be $1.00 per share, plus accrued 
dividends and interest, if any.  At the time of any redemption under 
this paragraph A.4.(a) of Article IV, in addition to paying the 
redemption price, the Corporation shall repay the entire indebtedness 
owed by the Corporation to the holders of Preferred Stock. 
 
          (b)     If a holder of Preferred Stock desires to sell or 
transfer the Preferred Stock (to any person other than Nissho Iwai Co., 
Ltd. or one of its subsidiaries), the Corporation may redeem the 
Preferred Stock proposed for sale.  The redemption price shall be 
$1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends and interest, if any. 
 
               (i)     In the event of a proposed sale or transfer, 
the holder of Preferred Stock shall notify the Corporation of its 
intention to sell or transfer the Preferred Stock and provide the 
Corporation with the name of the proposed transferee and the terms 
of the transfer.  If the Corporation chooses to exercise its right to 
redeem, the Corporation shall give the holder of Preferred Stock 
written notice of its intention to redeem within 15 days from the date 
the Corporation receives notice of the holder's proposed sale or 
transfer.  Any such redemption notice by the Corporation will provide 
for redemption no more than 60 days from the time such redemption 
notice is given by the Corporation to the holder of Preferred Stock  
 
               (ii)     If a holder of Preferred Stock sells or 
transfers Preferred Stock, any transferee shall be subject to the 
redemption rights set forth in these Articles. 
 
          (c)     In the event that the Supply Agreement executed 
by the Corporation and Nissho Iwai American Corporation on October 7, 
1976, is terminated by either party, the Corporation may redeem by 
giving written notice to the holders of the Preferred Stock and 
stating in such notice that the shares of Preferred Stock shall be 
redeemed on a specified date which shall not be more than 60 days 
from the date such notice is given.  The redemption price shall be 
$1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends and interest, if any. 
 
     Notice of any proposed redemption of shares of Preferred Stock 
shall be given by the Corporation by mailing a copy of such notice 
to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed, at their 
respective addresses as appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 
     5.     Redemption by Holder.  In the event that the Supply 
Agreement executed by the Corporation and Nissho Iwai American 
Corporation on October 7, 1976, is terminated by either party, the 
holders of the Preferred Stock may redeem by giving written notice to 
the Corporation and stating in such notice that the shares shall be 
redeemed on a specified date which shall not be less than 60 days 
from the date such notice is given.  The redemption price shall be 
$1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends and interest, if any. 
 
     B.     Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. 
 
          1.     Voting Rights.  Subject to the rights granted 
herein to the Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock shall 
possess all of the voting power of the capital stock of this Corporation.  
All such shares shall have one vote per share and shall vote together 
as one class except as provided in this Article IV, Section B, 
subsection 1, or as may otherwise be required by law. 
 
     At any time that the number of outstanding shares of the Class 
B Common Stock shall equal or exceed 25 percent of the total 
outstanding shares of Common Stock, determined as of the record 
date established for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled 
to vote, the shares of the Class A and Class B Common Stock shall vote 
separately for the purpose of electing directors.  At any such time, the 
holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be 
entitled to elect a number of directors equal to 25 percent (rounded up to 
the nearest whole number) of the total number of authorized directors.  
The holders of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, 
shall elect all remaining members of the Board of Directors.  The two 
classes shall continue to vote separately for the election of directors 
as long as the outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock represent 
25 percent or more of the total outstanding Common Stock. 
 
     Without regard to the above provisions relating to class voting 
for directors, if at any time the number of outstanding shares of the 
Class A Common Stock shall be less than 12.5 percent of the total 
outstanding Common Stock, the holders of the Class B Common Stock 
shall continue to elect, voting as a separate class, 25 percent 
(rounded up to the nearest whole number) of the total number of 
authorized directors, and the holders of the Class A Common Stock and 
the holders of the Class B Common Stock shall elect all remaining 
members of the Board of Directors, voting together as a single class. 
 
     In any vote for the removal of a director from office, the shares 
of the Class A and Class B Common Stock shall vote together and as one 
class, except that a director elected by the vote of either the Class 
A Common Stock or the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, 
or a director appointed to fill the vacancy left by a director who was 
elected by separate class vote, may be removed from office only upon 
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding 
shares of the class which elected him or his predecessor. 
 
     Nothing within this Article IV concerning voting rights is 
intended to modify or otherwise affect the voting provisions which 
are contained in Article VI of these Restated Articles of Incorporation, 
as amended. 
 
     2.     Conversion Rights of the Class A Common Stock.  
 
          Subject to the following terms and conditions, each share of 
Class A Common Stock shall be convertible into a fully paid and 
nonassessable share of the Class B Common Stock.  At the option of the 
respective holders, up to 1,017,000 shares of Class A Common Stock which 
will be outstanding upon the filing with the Oregon Corporation 
Commissioner of these Restated Articles of Incorporation shall be 
convertible at any time, and all remaining shares shall be convertible 
at any time from and after the 90th day following the effective date 
under the Securities Act of 1933 of the Corporation's Registration 
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 
1980.  The conversion ratio shall be one share of Class B Common Stock 
for each share of Class A Common Stock surrendered for conversion.  
Such conversion rights shall include and be subject to the following: 
 
          (a)     Conversion may be affected as to all or any whole 
number of shares evidenced by any certificate for shares of Class A 
Common Stock upon surrender of such certificate to the Corporation 
at its principal office or to such agent or agents as may be designated 
by the Board of Directors.  Shares so surrendered for conversion shall 
be accompanied by written evidence of the holder's election to convert 
such shares and (if so requested by the Corporation) accompanied by an 
instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly 
executed by the holder of his duly authorized attorney. 
 
          (b)     As promptly as practicable after the surrender of 
the shares for conversion in the manner herein provided, the Corporation 
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holder of the shares so 
surrendered, certificates representing the number of fully paid and 
nonassessable shares of the Class B Common Stock of the Corporation into 
which such shares of Class A may be converted together with (if the 
certificate for the shares of Class A surrendered includes shares which 
are not being converted) certificates representing the number of shares 
of Class A Common Stock not then being so converted.  Such conversion 
shall be deemed to have been made as soon as the shares of the Class A 
Common have been surrendered for conversion in the manner herein provided, 
so that the rights of the holder of the shares of Class A Common so 
surrendered shall cease at such time and the person entitled to receive the 
Class B Common Stock upon such conversion shall be treated for all 
purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Class B 
Common Stock at such time; provided, however, that no such surrender on 
any date when the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall be closed 
or after the record date shall have been set shall be effective to 
constitute the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Class 
B Common Stock upon conversion of their shares of Class A Common Stock 
as the record holder or holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock 
on such date, but rather such shares shall retain the rights of Class A 
Common Stock until after the event for which the record date was set or 
the transfer books were closed. 
 
          (c)     The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep 
available for issue upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock such 
number of its authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock as 
will be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of 
the Class A Common Stock. 
 
          (d)     In the case of any reclassification of the outstanding 
shares of the Class B Common Stock, or in the case of any consolidation or 
merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, the result of 
which is that shares of Class B Common Stock become convertible into or 
entitled to receive securities or other property different from that which 
shares of Class A Common Stock then outstanding shall have the right 
thereafter to convert any of such shares into the kind and amount of 
shares of stock and other securities which a holder of that number of 
shares of the Class B Common Stock into which such shares are convertible 
received or is entitled to receive. 
 
          (e)     At no time shall the record date be set for any vote by 
the shareholders of the Corporation upon any merger, consolidation, sale 
of substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any other event 
which under the Oregon Business Corporation Act is required to be submitted 
to the shareholders for a vote without first providing not less than 10 
days' prior written notice of such date and event to the registered holders 
of the Class A Common Stock as shown on the books of the Corporation, if 
as a part of such transaction the shares of the Class B Common Stock are 
to be treated differently or to be entitled to different rights than the 
shares of the Class A Common Stock.  
 
     3.     Other Rights.  All rights to which holders of capital stock 
are entitled and which are not expressly granted to the Preferred Stock 
under this Article are reserved to and vested in the Common Stock.  In 
all respects other than voting, which rights are set forth hereinabove, 
the shares of the Class A and the Class B Common Stock shall have 
identical rights, provided that no stock dividend, stock split or other 
issuance of shares by the Corporation without consideration shall without 
express authorization of the Board of Directors result in the shares of 
one class of stock becoming entitled to receive shares of the other.  No 
stock dividend, stock split or other issuance of shares without 
consideration shall be effected by the Corporation with respect to 
either class of Common Stock except such action as shall affect both 
classes of stock ratably on a share-for-share basis.  There shall be 
no preference between shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of 
Class B Common Stock with respect to dividends or the rights to proceeds 
upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of the affairs of the 
Corporation. 
 
                             ARTICLE V
  
     The authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be 
seven, provided that such number may be increased (or decreased to not 
less than 5) by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Vacancies on the 
Board may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors, 
including any vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors, 
provided that no vacancy created by the resignation, removal from office 
or death of a director who was elected by a separate class vote of the 
Common Stock shall be filled by the Board of Directors, except upon the 
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors similarly 
elected by such class.  If none shall be remaining, the vacancy shall be 
filled by the remainder of the directors. 
 
                            ARTICLE VI 
 
     A.     The affirmative vote of the holders of not less 
than 80 percent of all outstanding Common Stock, voting as one 
class, shall be required for the approval or authorization of any 
"business combination" (as hereafter defined) with any person or 
entity which, as of the record date for the determination of the 
shareholders entitled to notice thereof and to vote thereon, is the 
beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock 
of the Corporation.  Any such 80 percent vote in order to constitute due 
and valid authorization under this Article must include not less than 50 
percent of the Common Stock held by persons other than the person or 
entity interested in such transaction. 
     B.     The term "business combination" shall mean 
          1.     any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or 
any subsidiary of the Corporation with or into any other person or 
entity; 
          2.     the sale of substantially all of the assets of the 
Corporation to any other person or entity; or 
          3.     any other transaction with such person or entity for 
which approval of the shareholders of this Corporation is required by 
law or by any agreement between the Corporation and any national 
securities exchange. 
     C.     The foregoing voting requirements shall not be applicable 
to any business combination approved by resolution of the Board of 
Directors prior to any such shareholder vote, provided that the 
resolution received the affirmative vote of a majority of the 
directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders 
(including any replacements for such directors who were appointed by 
the board), or to any business combination solely between the 
Corporation and any other corporation or entity in which 50 percent or 
more of the voting stock or interest is owned by the Corporation. 
     D.     Beneficial ownership for purposes of this Section shall 
be deemed to include all shares which would be determined to be 
beneficially owned (whether directly by such person or entity or 
indirectly through any affiliate or otherwise) under Rule 13d-3 of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission as in effect on the date of 
filing of these Restated Articles of Incorporation  with the Oregon 
Corporation Commissioner as well as all shares of the Corporation 
which the other entity has the right to acquire, pursuant to any 
agreement or otherwise. 
     E.     The determination of whether a proposed business 
combination is within the scope of this Article VI, including 
without limitation, the determination of whether such other party 
beneficially owns 10 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock 
of the Corporation for purposes of this Article VI, shall be made by 
the Board of Directors.  Such determination shall, if made in god 
faith, be binding upon all parties. 
     F.     The shareholder vote, if any, required for any business 
combination not expressly subject to the supermajority voting 
provision of this Article VI shall be such vote as may otherwise be 
required by applicable law. 
 
                              ARTICLE VII 
 
     Articles V and VI, and this Article VII, of these Restated 
Articles of Incorporation may not be amended except upon the affirmative 
vote of 80 percent of the outstanding Common Stock. 
 
                              ARTICLE VIII 
 
     A.     The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify to 
the fullest extent not prohibited by law any person who is made 
or threatened to be made a party to, witness in, or otherwise involved 
in, any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
administrative, investigative, legislative, formal or informal, 
internal or external or otherwise (including an action, suit or 
proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact 
that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the 
Corporation or a fiduciary within the meaning of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to any employee benefit plan of 
the Corporation, or serves or served at the request of the Corporation 
as a director, officer, employee or agent or as a fiduciary of an 
employee benefit plan, of another corporation, partnership, joint 
venture, trust, or other enterprise.  Any indemnification provided 
pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any rights to 
which the person indemnified may otherwise be entitled under any 
articles of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, statute, policy of 
insurance, vote of shareholders or Board of Directors, or otherwise, 
which exists at or subsequent to the time such person incurs or becomes 
subject to such liability and expense. 
 
     B.     To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, no director 
of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or 
its shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director.  
No amendment or repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of 
any provision of these Restated Articles of Incorporation inconsistent 
with this Article VIII, nor a change in the law, shall adversely affect 
any right or protection that is based upon this Paragraph B and pertains 
to conduct that occurred prior to the time of such amendment, repeal, 
adoption or change.  No change in the law shall reduce or eliminate the 
rights and protections set forth in this Paragraph B unless the change 
in the law specifically requires such reduction or elimination.  If the 
Oregon Business Corporation Act is amended after this Article VIII 
becomes effective to authorize corporate action further eliminating or 
limiting the personal liability of directors of the Corporation, then 
the liability of directors of the Corporation shall be eliminated or 
limited to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Oregon Business 
Corporation Act as so amended. 
 
                                 ARTICLE IX 
 
     (1)     No contract or other transaction between the Corporation 
and one or more of its directors or any other corporation, firm, 
association or entity in which one or more of its directors are 
directors or officers or are financially interested, shall be either 
void or voidable because of such relationship or interest or because 
such director or directors are present at the meeting of the Board of 
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies 
such contract or transaction or because his or their votes are counted 
for such purpose, if: 
           (a)     The fact of such relationship or interest is 
disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or committee which 
authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction by a vote 
or consent sufficient for the purpose without counting the votes or 
consents of such interested directors; or  
           (b)     The fact of such relationship or interest is 
disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they 
authorize, approve or ratify such contract or transaction by vote or 
written consent; or 
          (c)     The contract or transaction is fair and reasonable 
to the Corporation. 
     (2)     Common or interested directors may be counted in 
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of 
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes or ratifies such 
contract or transaction. 
 
     This Article shall not invalidate any contract or other transaction 
which would otherwise be valid under applicable law. 
 
                                  ARTICLE X 
 
     No holder of any class of stock of the Corporation now or 
hereafter authorized shall have any preemptive or preferential right 
of subscription to or otherwise be entitled to acquire any shares of 
any class of stock of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter 
authorized, or to any obligation convertible or exchangeable into 
stock of the Corporation, or any right, option or warrant of 
subscription to any of the foregoing, other than such, if any, as 
may be specifically authorized by, pursuant to the authority hereby 
given, the Board of Directors. 
 
                                 ARTICLE XI

                               ARTICLE 1 - Offices 
 
          Section 1.  Principal Office.  The registered office and principal 
executive offices of NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Corporation"), 
shall be located in Beaverton, Oregon, or such other location as the Board 
of Directors may determine. 
 
          Section 2.  Additional Offices.  The Corporation may also have 
offices at such other places, either within or without Oregon, as the Board 
of Directors may from time to time determine or as the business of the 
Corporation may require. 
 
 
                               ARTICLE 2 - Shareholders 
 
          Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of the shareholders of 
the Corporation shall be held at Beaverton, Oregon, or any other place, 
either within or without Oregon, selected by the Board of Directors, or 
in the absence of a selection by the Board of Directors, by the Chairman 
of the Board. 
 
          Section 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the 
shareholders shall be held on the third Monday in September of each year 
if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday then on the next succeeding 
business day, at such time as may be designated by the Board of Directors 
and specified in the notice of the meeting.  The Board of Directors shall 
have the discretion to designate a different annual meeting date for any 
year, provided that the date so designated is within 60 days of the date 
specified in the preceding sentence.  At the annual meeting, the 
shareholders shall elect by vote a Board of Directors, consider reports 
of the affairs of the Corporation, and transact such other business as 
may properly be brought before the meeting. 
 
          Section 3.  Special Meetings.  The Corporation shall hold a 
special meeting of shareholders upon the call of the Chairman of the 
Board or the Board of Directors, or if the holders of at least 10 percent 
of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at 
the special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary of the 
Corporation one or more written demands for the meeting describing the 
purpose or purposes for which it is to be held.  Special meetings of the 
shareholders may not be called by any other person or persons. 
 
          Section 4.  Notice of Meetings and Waiver.  
 
          (a)     General.  The Corporation shall notify shareholders in 
writing of the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders 
meeting not earlier than 60 days nor less than ten days before the meeting 
date.  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Corporation is 
required to give notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the 
meeting.  Such notice is effective when mailed if it is mailed postage 
prepaid and is correctly addressed to the shareholder's address shown 
in the Corporation's current record of shareholders.  Except as otherwise 
required by applicable law, notice of an annual meeting need not include a 
description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  
Notice of a special meeting shall include a description of the purpose or 
purposes for which the meeting is called. 
 
          (b)     Adjourned Meetings.  If an annual or special shareholders 
meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be 
given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is 
announced at the meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date for the 
adjourned meeting is fixed, or is required by law to be fixed, notice of the 
 adjourned meeting shall be given to persons who are shareholders as of the 
new record date.  A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to 
vote at a shareholders meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting 
unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the 
meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the 
original meeting. 
 
          (c)     Waiver of Notice.  A shareholder's attendance at a 
meeting waives objection to (i) lack of notice or defective notice of 
the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting 
objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, 
and (ii) consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not 
within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the 
shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. 
 
          Section 5.  Quorum.  Shares entitled to vote as a separate 
voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum 
of those shares exists with respect to that matter.  Unless otherwise 
required by law, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on 
that matter.  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it 
is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and 
for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be 
set for that adjourned meeting.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of 
those present in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting 
from time to time until a quorum exists.  Any business that might have 
been transacted at the original meeting may be transacted at the adjourned 
meeting if a quorum exists. 
 
          Section 6.  Voting Rights.  The voting rights of holders of stock 
of the Corporation, and the circumstances under which any class of stock has 
special voting rights and the manner of exercise thereof, are as set forth 
in the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Restated 
Articles").  Only shares of stock are entitled to vote.  Except as 
otherwise provided in the Restated Articles or by applicable law:  (i) each 
outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each 
matter voted on at a shareholders meeting; (ii) if a quorum exists, action 
on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group shall 
be approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action 
exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action; and 
(iii) directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by holders 
of the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum 
is present. 
 
          Section 7.  Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.  If the name 
signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy corresponds to the name of a 
shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to 
accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy and give it effect as the act 
of the shareholder.  If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or 
proxy does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the Corporation, 
if acting in good faith, is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote, 
consent, waiver or proxy and give it effect as the act of the shareholder 
if authorized by ORS 60.237 or any successor provision dealing with 
acceptance of votes.  
 
          Shares of the Corporation are not entitled to be voted if (i) they 
are owned, directly or indirectly, by another domestic or foreign 
corporation, and (ii) the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a 
majority of the shares entitled to be voted for the directors of such 
other corporation.  This paragraph does not limit the power of a corporation 
to vote any shares, including its own shares, held by it in a fiduciary 
capacity. 
 
          Any redeemable shares that the Corporation may issue are not 
entitled to be voted after notice of redemption is mailed to the holders 
and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, 
trust company or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation 
to pay the holders the redemption price on surrender of the shares. 
 
          Section 8.  Proxies.  A shareholder entitled to vote or to 
execute any waiver or consent may do so either in person or by written 
proxy duly executed and filed at or before the meeting at which it is to 
be used with the Secretary at the Corporation or other officer or agent 
of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment of a 
proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or 
agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment 
is valid for 11 months unless a longer period is expressly provided in 
the appointment form.  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the 
shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it 
is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. 
 
           Section 9.  Shareholder Lists.  After fixing a record 
date for a meeting, the Corporation shall prepare an alphabetical 
list of the names of all of its shareholders who are entitled to notice 
of the meeting.  The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within 
each voting group, by class or series of shares and show the address 
of and the number of shares held by each shareholder.  The shareholder 
list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning 
two business days after notice of the meeting for which the list was 
prepared is given and continuing through the meeting.  Such list shall 
be kept on file at the Corporation's principal office or at a place 
identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be 
held.  A shareholder, or the shareholder's agent or attorney, shall 
be entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements 
of law, to copy the list during regular business hours and at the 
shareholder's expense during the period it is available for inspection.  
The Corporation shall make the shareholder list available at the 
meeting, and any shareholder, or the shareholder's agent or attorney, 
is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or 
any adjournment.  The original stock transfer book shall be prima 
facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to inspect 
such list or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.  Refusal or 
failure to prepare or make available the shareholder list does not 
affect the validity of action taken at the meeting. 
 
          Section 10. Business of Shareholder Meetings. 
 
          (a)     The Chairman of the Board, or such other officer 
of the Corporation designated by the Board of Directors, shall call 
meetings of the shareholders to order and shall act as presiding 
officer thereof.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors 
prior to the meeting, the presiding officer, or any person he or she 
designates, shall also have the authority in his or her sole 
discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, 
without limitation:  the establishment of rules for determining if 
business is to be brought before such meeting; the establishment of 
procedures for the maintenance of order and safety; setting limitations 
on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the 
Corporation; imposing restrictions on entry to such meeting of shareholders 
after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof; determining the 
opening and closing of the voting polls; imposing restrictions on the 
persons (other than shareholders or their proxies) who may attend such 
meeting; ascertaining whether any shareholder or his or her proxy may be 
excluded from such meeting based upon any determination by the presiding 
officer, in his or her discretion, that any such person has disrupted or 
is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat; and by determining the 
circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions 
at such meeting. 
 
           (b)     Only business within the purpose or purposes described 
in the meeting notice may be conducted at a special shareholders meeting. 
 
           (c)     At the annual meeting of the shareholders, only such 
business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before 
the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business 
must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) 
given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise 
brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of 
Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by 
a shareholder, and (iv) under law, an appropriate subject of shareholder 
action. 
 
          (d)  In addition to any other applicable requirements, 
including, without limitation, requirements relating to solicitation 
of proxies and proposals of security holders under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Proxy Rules") for business to 
be properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder, 
including nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors, 
the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to 
the Secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice 
must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices 
of the Corporation, not less than 60 days prior to the meeting.  A 
shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter 
the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:  (i) a 
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the 
annual meeting; (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the 
Corporation's books, of the shareholder proposing such business; (iii) 
the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially 
owned by the shareholder; (iv) any material interest of the shareholder 
in such business; (v) a description of all arrangements or understandings 
between such shareholder and any other person or persons in connection with 
the proposal of such business, (vi) a representation that such shareholder 
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such 
business before the meeting; and (vii) with regard to nominations, all 
information required by the Proxy Rules. 
 
          (e)     No business shall be conducted at an annual or special 
meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 
10.  The presiding officer at a shareholders meeting shall, if the facts 
warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly 
brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section.  If the presiding officer should so determine, he or she shall 
so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought 
before the meeting shall not be transacted. 
 
          (f)     The Chairman of the Board shall, in advance of any 
meeting of shareholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to 
act at the meeting.  The inspectors of election shall decide upon the 
qualifications of voters, count the votes, declare the results and make 
a written report thereof. 
 
 
                           ARTICLE 3 - Directors 
 
          Section 1.  Powers.  The Corporation shall have a Board of 
Directors.  All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the 
authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall 
be managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors. 
 
          Section 2.  Number and Qualifications.  The number of 
directors shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors, 
and shall not be less than five.  Any decrease in the number of 
directors designated by the Board of Directors shall not shorten an 
incumbent director's term.  Directors need not be residents of 
Oregon or shareholders of the Corporation. 
 
          Section 3.  Election and Tenure.  The directors shall 
be elected at the annual meeting of the shareholders, by separate 
vote of the Class A and Class B Common Stock in the manner required 
by the Restated Articles.  Their term of office shall begin 
immediately after election.  The terms of all directors, including 
a director elected to fill a vacancy, expire at the next annual 
shareholders meeting following their election.  Despite the expiration 
of a director's term, the director shall continue to serve until his 
or her successor is elected and qualifies or until there is a decrease 
in the number of directors. 
 
          Section 4.  Vacancies.  A vacancy in the Board of Directors 
shall exist upon the death, resignation or removal of any director or 
upon an increase in the number of directors.  If a vacancy occurs on 
the Board of Directors as a result of death, resignation or removal 
from office of a director who is elected by a separate class vote of 
the common stock, it shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a 
majority of the remaining directors similarly elected by such class.  
If none shall be remaining, the vacancy shall be filled by all directors 
then in office.  If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer 
than a quorum of the Board, they may fill the vacancy by an affirmative 
vote of a majority of all of the directors remaining in office.  If a 
vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors as a result of an increase in 
the number of directors, the Board of Directors may fill such vacancy, 
provided they may not elect more than three additional directors in any 
period between annual shareholders meetings to fill such vacancies. 
 
          Section 5.  Resignation.  A director may resign at any time by 
delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the 
Board of Directors or the Corporation.  
 
          Section 6.  Removal.  The shareholders may remove one or more 
directors with or without cause.  If a director is elected by a voting 
group of shareholders, only the shareholders of that voting group may 
participate in the vote to remove the director.  A director may be removed 
by the shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing 
the director and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one 
of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director. 
 
          Section 7.  Meetings - Notice and Waiver. 
 
          (a)  The Board of Directors may hold regular or special 
meetings in or out of Oregon. 
 
          (b)  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be 
held without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting.  
The Board of Directors may fix, by resolution, the time and place for 
the holding of regular meetings. 
 
          (c)  Special meetings of the Board of Directors for any 
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the 
Board, or a majority of directors.  Notice of special meetings of the 
Board of Directors shall be preceded by at least 48 hours' notice of the 
date, time, place and general purpose of the meeting.  The notice shall 
be given orally, either in person or by telephone, or shall be delivered in 
writing, either personally, by mail or by facsimile or by telegram.  
 
          (d)  Notice of the time and place of holding any adjourned 
meeting need not be given if such time and place are fixed at the meeting 
adjourned. 
 
          (e)  The transaction of all business at any meeting of the 
Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, however called or noticed, 
or wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held 
after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present, and if, either 
before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present shall 
sign a written waiver of notice, or consent to holding such meeting, 
or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents or 
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of 
the minutes of the meeting.  A director's attendance at or participation 
in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting 
unless the director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon 
the director's arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting 
business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to 
action taken at the meeting. 
 
          Section 8.  Quorum and Vote.  
 
          (a)  A majority of the directors in office shall constitute 
a quorum for the transaction of business.  A majority of the directors 
present, in the absence of a quorum, may adjourn from time to time but 
may not transact any business.  If a quorum is present when a vote is 
taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the 
act of the Board of Directors, unless a different vote is required by law. 
 
          (b)  A director who is present at a meeting of the Board 
of Directors, or is present at a meeting of a committee of the Board 
of Directors, when corporate action is taken, is deemed to have assented 
to the action taken unless (i) the director objects at the beginning of 
the meeting, or promptly upon the director's arrival, to holding the 
meeting or transacting business at the meeting, (ii) the director's 
dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of 
the meeting, or (iii) the director delivers written notice of dissent 
or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its 
adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the

date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for 
determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting 
of shareholders shall be the close of business on the day next preceding 
the day on which notice of such meeting is given, or, if notice is waived,

                ARTICLE 8 - Transactions With Interested Directors 
 
                       Section 1.  Validity of Transaction.
 
          (a)  No transaction involving the Corporation shall be 
voidable by the Corporation solely because of a director's direct or 
indirect interest in the transaction if: 
 
               (i)  The material facts of the transaction and the 
      director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board of 
      Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors, and the Board 
      of Directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the 
      transaction; 
 
              (ii)  The material facts of the transaction and the 
      director's interest were disclosed or known to the share-holders 
      entitled to vote and the shareholders authorized, approved or 
      ratified the transaction by the affirmative vote of the holders 
      of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the 
      Corporation, or by written consent; or 
 
               (iii)  The transaction was fair and reasonable to 
      the Corporation. 
 
          (b)     This Article 8 shall not invalidate any contract, 
transaction or determination that would otherwise be valid under 
applicable law. 
 
         Section 2.  Indirect Interest.  Solely for purposes of this 
Article 8, a director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in 
a transaction if another entity in which the director has a material 
financial interest or in which the director is a general partner is a 
party to the transaction; or the transaction with another entity of 
which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the 
transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board 
of Directors. 
 
           Section 3.  Authorization by Board.  For purposes of 
Section 1 of this Article 8, a transaction in which a director has 
an interest is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of 
Directors if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the 
directors on the Board of Directors, or on the committee, who have 
no direct or indirect interest in the transaction.  A transaction may 
not be authorized, approved or ratified under this Article 8 by a 
single director.  If a majority of the directors who have no direct or 
indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or 
ratify the transaction, a quorum shall be present for the purpose of 
taking action under this Article 8.  The presence of, or a vote cast 
by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction 
shall not affect the validity of any action taken under Section 1 of 
this Article 8 by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, if the 
transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in 
Section 1 of this Article 8. 
 
          Section 4.  Authorization by Shareholders.  For purposes of 
Section 1 of this Article 8, a transaction in which a director has an 
interest is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of 
a majority of the shares entitled to vote under this Article 8 voting 
as a single voting group.  Shares owned by or voted under the control 
of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, 
and shares owned by or voted under the control of any entity described 
in paragraph (a) of Section 2 of this Article 8 may be counted in a 
vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve or 
ratify a transaction by vote of the shareholders under Section 1 of 
this Article 8.  A majority of the shares, whether or not present, 
that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under 
this Article 8 constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action 
under this Article 8. 
 
 
 
                                ARTICLE 9 -Indemnification 
 
          (a)  The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, any person who is made, or threatened to be made, a 
party to or witness in, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, 
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
administrative, investigative, or otherwise (including any action, suit or 
proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that: 
 
 
               (i)  the person is or was a director or officer of the 
      Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; 
 
              (ii)  the person is or was serving as a fiduciary within 
      the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
      with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or 
      any of its subsidiaries; or 
 
             (iii)  the person is or was serving, at the request of the 
      Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as a director or officer, or 
      as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan, of another corporation, 
      partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. 
 
          (b)  The Corporation may indemnify its employees and other 
agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 
          (c)  The expenses incurred by a director or officer or other 
indemnified person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed 
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, 
investigative, or otherwise, which the director or officer is made or 
threatened to be  made a party to or witness in, or is otherwise involved 
in, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance upon written request if 
the indemnified person: 
 
               (i)  furnishes the Corporation a written affirmation that 
      in good faith the person believes that he or she is entitled to be 
      indemnified by the Corporation; and 
 
              (ii)  furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking to 
      repay such advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined 
      by a court that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by 
      the Corporation.  Such advances shall be made without regard to 
      the person's ability to repay such expenses and without regard to 
      the person's ultimate entitlement to indemnification under this 
      Article or otherwise.  
 
          (d)  The rights of indemnification provided in this Article 9 
shall be in addition to any rights to which a person may otherwise be 
entitled under any articles of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, statute, 
policy of insurance, vote of shareholders or Board of Directors, or 
otherwise; shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, 
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation; and shall inure to the 
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. 
 
          (e)  Any repeal of this Article 9 shall be prospective only 
and no repeal or modification of this Article 9 shall adversely affect 
any right or protection that is based upon this Article 9 and pertains 
to an act or omission that occurred prior to the time of such repeal or 
modification. 
 
          (f)  As a condition precedent to indemnification under this 
Article 9, not later than 30 days after receipt by the director or officer 
of notice of the commencement of any proceeding the director or officer 
shall, if a claim in respect of the proceeding is to be made against the 
Corporation under this Article 9, notify the Corporation in writing of the 
commencement of the proceeding.  The failure to properly notify the 
Corporation shall not relieve the Corporation from any liability which it 
may have to the director or officer otherwise than under this Article 9.  
With respect to any proceeding as to which the director or officer so 
notifies the Corporation of the commencement: 
 
               (i)  The Corporation shall be entitled to participate 
      in the proceeding at its own expense. 
 
              (ii)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 
      (f), the Corporation may, at its option and jointly with any 
      other indemnifying party similarly notified and electing to 
      assume such defense, assume the defense of the proceeding, with 
      legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the director or officer.  
      The director or officer shall have the right to use separate legal 
      counsel in the proceeding, but the corporation shall not be liable 
      to the director or officer  under this Article 9 for the fees and 
      expenses of separate legal counsel incurred after notice from the 
      Corporation of its assumption of the defense, unless (A) the director 
      or officer reasonably   concludes that there may be a conflict of 
      interest between the Corporation and the director or officer in the 
      conduct of the defense of the proceeding, or (B) the Corporation does 
      not use legal counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding.  
      The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any 
      proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to which 
      the director or officer has made the conclusion provided for in (A) 
      above. 
 
               (iii)  If two or more persons who may be entitled to 
      indemnification from the Corporation, including the director or 
      officer seeking indemnification, are parties to any proceeding, 
      the Corporation may require the director or officer to use the 
      same legal counsel as the other parties.  The director or officer 
      shall have the right to use separate legal counsel in the proceeding, 
      but the Corporation shall not be liable to the director or officer 
      under this Article 9 for the fees and expenses of separate legal 
      counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of the requirement 
      to use the same legal counsel as the other parties, unless the director 
      or officer reasonably concludes that there may be a conflict of 
      interest between the director or officer and any of the other parties 
      required by the Corporation to be represented by the same legal counsel. 
 
               (iv)  The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify the 
      director or officer under this Article 9 for any amounts paid in 
      settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, 
      which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  The director or officer 
      shall permit the Corporation to settle any proceeding that the 
      Corporation assumes the defense of, except that the Corporation 
      shall not settle any action or claim in any manner that would 
      impose any penalty or limitation on the director or officer 
      without such person's written consent. 
 
          (g)  Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 9, 
the Corporationn shall not be obligated under this Article 9 to make 
any indemnification or advance any expenses in connection with any claim 
made against any director or officer: 
 
               (i)  for which payment is required to be made to or on 
      behalf of the director or officer under any insurance policy, 
      except with respect to any excess amount to which the director 
      or officer is entitled under this Article 9 beyond the amount of 
      payment under such insurance policy; 
 
               (ii) if a court having jurisdiction in the matter finally 
      determines that such indemnification is not lawful under any 
      applicable statute or public policy; 
 
              (iii) in connection with any proceeding (or part of any 
      proceeding) initiated by the director or officer, or any proceeding 
      by the director or officer against the Corporation or its directors, 
      officers, employees or other persons entitled to be indemnified by the 
      Corporation, unless: (A) the Corporation is expressly required by law 
      to make the indemnification; (B) the proceeding was authorized by the 
      Board of Directors; or (C) the director or officer initiated the 
      proceeding pursuant to subsection (i) of this Article 9 and the 
      director or officer is successful in whole or in part in such 
      proceeding; or 
 
               (iv)  for an accounting of profits made from the purchase 
      and sale by the director or officer of securities of the Corporation 
      within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or similar 
      provision of any state statutory law or common law. 
 
          (h)  In the event of payment under this Article 9, the 
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all 
of the rights of recovery of the director or officer.  The director or 
officer shall execute all documents required and shall do all acts that 
may be necessary to secure such rights and to enable the Corporation 
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
 
          (i)  Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, 
all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and officers under 
this Article 9 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to 
the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation 
and the director or officer.  Any director or officer may enforce any right 
to indemnification or advances under this Article 9 in any court of 
competent jurisdiction if: (i) the Corporation denies the claim for 
indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, or (ii) the Corporation 
does not dispose of such claim within 45 days of request therefor.  It shall 
be a defense to any such enforcement action (other than an action brought to 
enforce a claim for advancement of expenses pursuant to, and in compliance 
with, this Article 9) that the director or officer is not entitled to 
indemnification under this Article 9.  However, except as provided in 
subsection (f) of this Article 9, the Corporation shall not assert any 
defense to an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses 
pursuant to this Article 9 if the director or officer has tendered to the 
Corporation the affirmation and undertaking required hereunder.  The burden of 
proving by clear and convincing evidence that indemnification is not 
appropriate shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the 
Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) 
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that 
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the director or officer 
has met the applicable standard of conduct nor an actual determination by 
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal 
counsel) that indemnification is improper because the director or officer 
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be asserted as a 
defense to the action or create a presumption that the director or officer 
is not entitled to indemnification under this Article 9 or otherwise.  The 
director's or officer's expenses incurred in connection with successfully 
establishing such person's right to indemnification or advances, in whole or 
in part, in any proceeding shall also be paid or reimbursed by the 
Corporation. 
 
          (j) The rights conferred on any person by this Article 9 
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, 
employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, 
executors and administrators of such a person. 
 
          (k)  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation, 
upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf 
of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this 
Article 9. 
 
          (l)  If this Article 9 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated 
on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation 
shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full extent not 
prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article 9 that shall not have 
been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. 
 
                ARTICLE 10 - Limitation of Director Liability 
 
           To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of 
the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its 
shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Oregon 
Revised Statutes are amended, after this Article 10 becomes effective, 
to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal 
liability of directors of the Corporation, then the liability of directors 
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent 
permitted by the Oregon Revised Statutes, as so amended.  No amendment or 
repeal of this Article 10, nor the adoption of any provision of these Bylaws 
inconsistent with this Article 10, nor a change in the law, shall adversely 
affect any right or protection that is based upon this Article 10 and pertains 
to conduct that occurred prior to the time of such amendment, repeal, adoption 
or change.  No change in the law shall reduce or eliminate the rights and 
protections set forth in this Article 10 unless the change in the law 
specifically requires such reduction or elimination.

             not end after the Revolving Credit Termination Date). 
 
The Borrowers may request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans for 
more than one Interest Period in a single Competitive Bid Quote Request.  
No Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be given within 5 Business Days 
(or, in either case upon reasonable prior notice to the Banks, such other 
number of days as the Borrowers and the Agent may agree) of any other 
Competitive Bid Quote Request.  Each Competitive Bid Quote Request shall 
be in Dollars in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in integral multiples 
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof).  A Competitive Bid Quote Request that 
does not conform substantially to the format of Exhibit "C" hereto shall 
be rejected, and the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers of such 
rejection by telecopy. 
 
     2.3.3.  Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes.  Promptly and in 
any event before the close of business on the same Business Day of receipt 
of a Competitive Bid Quote Request that is not rejected pursuant to 
Section 2.3.2, the Agent shall send to each of the Banks by telecopy an 
Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes substantially in the form of 
Exhibit "D" hereto, which shall constitute an invitation by the Borrower 
to each Bank to submit Competitive Bid Quotes offering to make the 
Competitive Bid Loans to which such Competitive Bid Quote Request relates
in accordance with this Section 2.3. 
 
     2.3.4.  Submission and Contents of Competitive Bid Quotes.  (i) Each 
Bank may, in its sole discretion, submit a Competitive Bid Quote containing 
an offer or offers to make Competitive Bid Loans in response to any 
Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes.  Each Competitive Bid Quote must 
comply with the requirements of this Section 2.3.4 and must be submitted 
to the Agent by telecopy at its offices specified in or pursuant to 
Article XIII not later than (a) 9:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) at least 
three Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of 
a Eurodollar Auction or (b) 9:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the proposed 
Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either 
case upon reasonable prior notice to the Banks, such other time and 
date as the Company and the Agent may agree); provided that Competitive 
Bid Quotes submitted by BofA may only be submitted if BofA notifies the 
Company of the terms of the offer or offers contained therein not later 
than 15 minutes prior to the latest time at which the relevant 
Competitive Bid Quotes must be submitted by the other Banks.  Subject to 
Articles IV and VIII, any Competitive Bid Quote so made shall be 
irrevocable except with the written consent of the Agent given on the 
instructions of the Borrower. 
 
     (ii)  Each Competitive Bid Quote shall be in substantially the 
form of Exhibit "E" hereto and shall in any case specify: 
 
              (a)  the proposed Borrowing Date, which shall be the same 
      as that set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid 
      Quotes, 
 
               (b)  the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan 
      for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount 
      (1) may be greater than, less than or equal to the Commitment of 
      the quoting Bank, (2) must be at least $5,000,000 and an integral 
      multiple of $1,000,000, and (3) may not exceed the principal 
      amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers were requested, 
 
               (c)  in the case of a Eurodollar Auction, the Competitive 
      Bid Margin offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan, 
 
               (d)  the minimum or maximum amount, if any, of the 
      Competitive Bid Loan which may be accepted by the Borrower, 
 
               (e)  in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the 
      Absolute Rate offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan, and 
 
               (f)  the identity of the quoting Bank. 
 
     (iii)  The Agent shall reject any Competitive Bid Quote that: 
 
               (a)  is not substantially in the form of Exhibit 
      "E" hereto or does not specify all of the information required
       by Section 2.3.4(ii); 
 
               (b)  contains qualifying, conditional or similar 
       language, other than any such language contained in 
       Exhibit "E" hereto; 
 
               (c)  proposes terms other than or in addition to those 
       set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid 
       Quotes; or 
 
               (d)  arrives after the time set forth in Section 2.3.4(i). 
 
If any Competitive Bid Quote shall be rejected pursuant to this Section 
2.3.4(iii), then the Agent shall notify the relevant Bank of such 
rejection as soon as practical. 
 
        2.3.5.  Notice to Borrower.  The Agent shall promptly notify the 
Borrower of the terms (i) of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a 
Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.3.4 and (ii) of any 
Competitive Bid Quote that is in accordance with Section 2.3.4 and 
amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous 
Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same 
Competitive Bid Quote Request.  Any such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote 
shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such subsequent competitive Bid 
Quote specifically states that it is submitted solely to correct a 
manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote.  The Agent's notice 
to the Borrower shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Competitive 
Bid Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period 
specified in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request and the respective 
principal amounts and Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case 
may be, so offered. 
 
 	2.3.6.  Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Not later than 
(i) 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) at least three Business Days 
prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurodollar 
Auction or (ii) 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the proposed 
Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in 
either case upon reasonable prior notice to the Banks, such other 
time and date as the Company and the Agent may agree), the Borrower 
shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or rejection of the offers 
so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.3.5; provided, however, that 
the failure by the Borrower to give such notice to the Agent shall be 
deemed to be a rejection of all such offers.  In the case of acceptance, 
such notice (a "Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice") shall specify the 
aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are 
accepted.  The Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid Quote in whole 
or in part (subject to the terms of Section 2.3.4(ii)(d)); provided 
that: 
 
               (a)  the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive 
      Bid Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the 
      related Competitive Bid Quote Request; 
 
               (b)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the 
      basis of ascending Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as 
      the case may be; and  
 
               (c)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is 
      described in Section 2.3.4(iii) or that otherwise fails to 
      comply with the requirements of this Agreement for the purpose 
      of obtaining a Competitive Bid Loan under this Agreement. 

     2.3.7.  Allocation by Agent.  If offers are made by two or more 
Banks with the same Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case 
may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in 
respect of which offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, 
the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such 
offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Banks as 
nearly as possible (in such multiples, not less than $1,000,000, as the 
Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal 
amount of such offers; provided, however, that no Bank shall be allocated 
a portion of any Competitive Bid Advance which is less than the minimum 
amount which such Bank has indicated that it is willing to accept.  
Allocations by the Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be 
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The Agent shall promptly, 
but in any event on the same Business Day, notify each Bank of its receipt 
of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the aggregate principal amount 
of such Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each participating Bank. 
 
     2.3.8.  Administration Fee.  The Company hereby agrees to pay to 
the Agent an administration fee for Competitive Bid Quote Requests in 
such amounts as are from time to time agreed upon by the Company and 
the Agent. 
 
     2.4.  Fees. 
 
     2.4.1.  Facility Fee.  The Company hereby agrees to pay to the 
Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee at the rates per annum 
set forth below, based on the Leverage Ratio set forth in the table 
below on each Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused) for the period 
from the Effective Date to and including the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, payable in arrears on each Payment Date hereafter and on the 
Revolving Credit Termination Date for any period then ending for which 
such fee shall not have been theretofore paid; provided that on the 
Effective Date the Leverage Ratio shall be 0.32 to 1.00.  The adjustment, 
if any, to the facility fee shall be applicable on the fifth Business Day 
after delivery to the Banks of the financial statements delivered by the 
Company pursuant to Sections 6.1(i) or (ii).  If the financial statements 
are not received by the Agent within the time periods set forth in 
Sections 6.1(i) and (ii) and the Agent has given the Company five days' 
notice that such statements have not been received by the Agent, the 
maximum fee shall apply until such statements are received by the Agent. 
 
       Leverage Ratio                              Facility Fee

1)  Less than 0.50 to 1.00                             0.070% 
 
2)  Greater than or equal to 0.50 to 1.00              0.095% 
    and less than 0.75 to 1.00 
 
3)  Greater than or equal to 0.75 to 1.00              0.125% 
 
All fees shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed 
on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days. 
 
     2.5.  General Facility Terms.
 
     2.5.1.  Method of Borrowing.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. 
(San Francisco time, in the case of any Dollar borrowing, or the 
local time at the applicable payment office of the Agent for the 
applicable currency, in the case of any non-Dollar borrowing) on 
each Borrowing Date, each Bank shall make available its Loan or 
Loans in funds immediately available to the Agent, in the applicable 
currency, at the applicable payment office of the Agent for such 
currency, or at such other location and time as the Agent shall direct.  
Unless otherwise instructed by the Company, the Agent shall deposit the 
funds so received from the Banks in the Company's account at BofA's 
main office in San Francisco. 
 
     2.5.2.  Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Ratable Advance 
and each conversion and continuation with respect to a Ratable Advance, 
shall be in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples 
of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof), or U.S. Dollar Equivalent amounts; 
provided, however, that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the aggregate 
amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment. 
 
     2.5.3.  Repayment.  Except for optional payments pursuant to 
Section 2.5.4, each Competitive Bid Advance shall be paid in full by 
the Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, 
and each Ratable Advance shall be paid in full by the Company on the 
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, unless converted or 
continued in accordance with Section 2.2.4, but in any event all Advances 
shall be paid in full on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. 
 
     2.5.4.  Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may from 
time to time pay all outstanding Ratable Advances, or, in a minimum 
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if 
in excess thereof), or U.S. Dollar Equivalent amounts, any portion of 
the outstanding Ratable Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice 
to the Agent (or four, in the case of prepayment of Eurocurrency 
Advances).  All such payments shall be made in immediately available 
funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified in Article XIII or 
at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified by the Agent in 
accordance with Section 2.5.8. by 11:00 a.m.  (San Francisco time, in the 
case of any Dollar denominated Ratable Advance being prepaid, or the local 
time at the applicable payment office of the Agent for the applicable 
currency, in the case of any non-Dollar Ratable Advance being prepaid) on 
the date of payment.  A Competitive Bid Advance may not be prepaid prior 
to the last day of its applicable Interest Period without the prior consent 
of the Bank which originally made such Loan, which consent may be given or 
withheld at the Bank's sole and absolute discretion.  Any prepayment of a 
Fixed Rate Advance prior to the end of an applicable Interest Period shall 
be subject to the indemnification provided in Section 3.4. 
 
     2.5.5.  Interest Periods.  Subject to the provisions of Section 
2.5.6, each Advance shall bear interest from and including the first 
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) 
the earlier of (i) the last day of such Interest Period or (ii) the date 
of any earlier prepayment as permitted by Section 2.5.4, at the interest 
rate determined as applicable to such Advance, subject to the Company's 
right to convert or continue Advances pursuant to Section 2.2.4.  The 
Borrowers shall not request a Fixed Rate Advance if, after giving effect 
to the requested Fixed Rate Advance, more than 20 separate Fixed Rate 
Advances would be outstanding. 
 
     2.5.6  Rate after Maturity.  Except as provided in the next sentence, 
any Advance not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, 
shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the 
Alternate Base Rate plus 1% per annum.  In the case of a Fixed Rate 
Advance the maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance 
shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period, 
at the higher of the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period 
plus 1% per annum or the Alternate Base Rate plus 1% per annum. 
 
     2.5.7  Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis.  Interest accrued 
on each Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable 
Interest Period and on any date on which such Advance is prepaid, whether 
due to acceleration or otherwise.  Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate 
Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be 
payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest 
Period.  Interest on all Floating Rate Advances calculated on the basis 
of the Corporate Base Rate shall be calculated for the actual number of 
days elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of 365/366 days.  Interest 
on all other Advances shall be calculated for the actual number of days 
elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days.  Interest shall be 
payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment 
on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 11:00 a.m. (San 
Francisco time, in the case of any Dollar Advance, or the local time at 
the applicable payment office of the Agent for the applicable currency, 
in the case of any non-Dollar Advance) at the place of payment.  If any 
payment of principal or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day 
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next 
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such 
extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection 
with such payment. 
 
     2.5.8.  Method of Payment.  Except as specifically provided in this 
Agreement and in the following sentence, all payments of principal, 
interest, and fees hereunder shall be made in immediately available 
funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to Article 
XIV or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing 
by the Agent to the Company (at least one Business Day prior to the 
applicable due date) by 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time, in the case of any 
Dollar Advance, or the local time at the applicable payment office of the 
Agent for the applicable currency, in the case of any non-Dollar Advance) 
on the date when due and shall be applied (i) first, ratably among the 
Banks with respect to any principal and interest due in connection with 
Ratable Advances, (ii) second, after all amounts described in clause (i) have 
been 
satisfied, ratably among those Banks for whom any payment of principal and 
interest is due in connection with any Competitive Bid Advances and (iii) 
third, after all amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii) have been 
satisfied, ratably to any other Obligations then due.  All payments of 
principal and interest hereunder shall be made in the currency in which 
the related Advance was made.  Each payment delivered to the Agent for 
the account of any Bank shall be delivered by the Agent to such Bank 
in the same type of funds which the Agent received at such Bank's address 
specified pursuant to Article XIV or at any Lending Installation 
specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Bank.  If such 
payment is received by the Agent by 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time, in 
the case of any Dollar Advance, or the local time at the applicable payment 
office of the Agent for the applicable currency, in the case of any 
non-Dollar Advance) such delivery to the Banks shall be made on the same 
day and if received thereafter shall be made on the next succeeding 
Business Day.  The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of 
the Company held at BofA for each payment of principal, interest and 
fees owing by any Borrower as it becomes due hereunder. 
 
     2.5.9.  Notes; Telephonic Notices; Designation of Company.  Each 
Bank is hereby authorized to record on the schedule attached to each 
of its Notes, or otherwise record in accordance with its usual 
practice, the date and amount of each of its Loans of the type 
evidenced by such Note; provided, however, that any failure to so 
record shall not affect the Borrowers' Obligations under any Note.  
The Borrowers hereby authorize the Banks and the Agent to extend, 
continue and convert Advances, effect Rate Option selections and submit 
Competitive Bid Quotes based on telephonic notices made by any person 
or persons the Agent or any Bank in good faith believes to be an 
authorized officer or an officer, employee or agent of such Borrower 
designated by an authorized officer.  The Borrowers agree to deliver 
promptly to the Agent a written or telecopy confirmation of each 
telephonic notice signed by an authorized officer.  If the written or 
telecopy confirmation differs in any material respect from the action 
taken by the Agent and the Banks, the records of the Agent and the 
Banks shall govern absent manifest error.  Each Subsidiary Borrower 
hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent and attorney-in-fact, 
authorized to execute and deliver on its behalf any and all statements, 
certificates, documents and agreements as may be required or contemplated 
hereunder, including Ratable Borrowing Notices and Notices of 
Conversion/Continuation and requests for offers to make Competitive 
Bid Loans, and to receive any and all notices and other communications 
from the Agent and the Banks hereunder and to perform on such Subsidiary 
Borrower's behalf any and all other acts, deeds and requirements of this 
Agreement. 
 
     2.5.10.  Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments.  
The Agent will notify each Bank of the contents of each Ratable Borrowing 
Notice, Notice of Conversion/Continuation (or automatic conversion 
pursuant to subsection 2.2.4(c)), and payment notice received by it 
hereunder promptly and in any event (provided such items were timely 
received by the Agent from the Borrowers) before the close of business 
on the same Business Day of receipt thereof (or, in the case of borrowing 
notices with respect to Floating Rate Advances, within one hour of receipt 
thereof).  The Agent will notify each Bank of the interest rate applicable 
to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest 
rate and will give each Bank prompt notice of each change in the Alternate 
Base Rate in respect of any outstanding Floating Rate Advance. 
 
     2.5.11.  Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent  Unless the Borrower 
or a Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on 
which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case 
of a Bank, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, 
a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account 
of the Banks, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent 
may assume that such payment has been made.  The Agent may, but shall 
not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the 
intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Bank or 
the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to 
the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, 
repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest 
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date 
such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent 
recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of 
payment by a Bank, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (y) 
in the case of payment by the Company, the interest rate applicable to 
the relevant Loan. 
 
     2.5.12.  Cancellation.  The Company may at any time after the date 
hereof cancel the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in a minimum 
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000) 
ratably among the Banks upon at least three Business Days' prior 
written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of 
such reduction; provided, however, no such notice of cancellation shall 
be effective to the extent that it would reduce the Aggregate Commitment 
to an amount which would be less than the outstanding principal amount 
of Loans at the time such cancellation is to take effect.  Any notice of 
cancellation given pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable and 
shall specify the date upon which such cancellation is to take effect. 
 
     2.5.13.  Lending Installations.  Each Bank may book its Loans at 
any Lending Installation selected by such Bank and may change its 
Lending Installation from time to time.  Each Bank will notify the Agent 
and the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement of the Lending 
Installation which it intends to utilize for each type of Loan hereunder.  
Each Bank may, by written or telecopy notice to the Agent and the Company, 
change the Lending Installation through which Loans will be made by it and 
for whose account Loan payments are to be made. 
 
     2.5.14.  Currency Fluctuations.  If the aggregate principal amount 
of all Advances outstanding (after converting each Eurocurrency Advance 
to its U.S. Dollar Equivalent on the date of calculation) as of the last 
Business Day of any calendar month exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, then 
upon five Business Days' written notice from such Bank to the Borrowers 
and the Agent, the Borrowers shall prepay an aggregate principal amount 
of Ratable Advances (ratably among the Banks) such that the outstanding 
principal balance of all Advances outstanding does not exceed the Aggregate 
Commitment.  Unless otherwise specified by the Company at a time during 
which there exists no Default, prepayments under this Section 2.5.14 shall 
be allocated ratably among the Borrowers according to their respective 
outstanding Advances. 
 
     2.5.15.  Failure to Pay in a Eurocurrency.  If any Borrower is 
unable for any reason to effect payment of a Eurocurrency Advance in 
a Eurocurrency as required by Section 2.5.8 or if any Borrower shall 
default in the payment when due of any payment in a Eurocurrency, the 
Banks may, at their option, require such payment to be made to the 
Agent at the Agent's office specified in Article XIV in the equivalent 
amount in Dollars at the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of such Eurocurrency 
to the place or places where such payment was payable.  In any case in 
which the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars, the Borrower 
agrees to hold each Bank harmless from any loss incurred by such Bank 
arising from any change in the value of Dollars in relation to such 
Eurocurrency between the date such payment became due and the date of 
payment thereof.  The Borrowers' Obligations under this Section 2.5.15 
shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
 
     2.5.16.  Judgment Currency Provisions.  If for the purposes of 
obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due 
hereunder or under any Note in any currency (the "Original Currency") into 
another currency (the "Other Currency"), the parties hereto agree, to 
the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall 
be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures BofA could 
purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day 
preceding that on which final judgment is given.  To the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, the Obligations of the Borrowers in respect 
to any sum due in the Original Currency to any Bank hereunder shall, 
notwithstanding any judgment in an Other Currency, be discharged only to 
the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Bank of any 
sum adjudged to be so due in the Other Currency such Bank may in accordance 
with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency with the Other 
Currency; if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than 
the sum originally due to the Bank in the Original Currency, the Borrowers 
severally agree, as a separate Obligation and notwithstanding any such 
judgment, to indemnify such Bank against such loss, and if the amount of 
the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due such 
Bank in the Original Currency, such Bank agrees to remit to the Borrower 
such excess. 
 
     2.6.  Extension of Revolving Credit Termination Date.  (a) The 
Company may, from time to time, by notice to the Agent (each such notice 
being an "Extension Notice") given no later than 30 days but not sooner 
than 60 days prior to October 31 of each year beginning 1996 (each such 
October 31, called an "Extension Date") of this Agreement, extend the 
Revolving Credit Termination Date to a date one year after the then 
applicable Revolving Credit Termination Date.  Such extension shall not 
be effective with respect to a Bank which, by a notice (a "Withdrawal 
Notice") to the Company and the Agent given within 30 days following 
the Agent's receipt of such Extension Notice, declines to consent to 
such extension or which has failed to respond to the Company and the 
Agent within said 30-day period (each Bank giving a Withdrawal Notice 
or failing to respond in a timely manner being called a "Withdrawing Bank" 
and each Bank other than a Withdrawing Bank being a "Continuing Bank").  
Such extension shall be effective only if the aggregate of the Commitments 
of the Continuing Banks is 66 2/3% or more of the Aggregate Commitment in 
effect on the date of this Agreement. 
 
If Banks with less than 66-2/3% of the Aggregate Commitment elect 
to be Continuing Banks, the Revolving Credit Termination Date shall 
not be extended and the Banks (including Withdrawing Banks) shall be 
obligated to make Loans to the Company in accordance with the original 
terms of this Agreement (including any previously approved extensions).  
If Banks with 66-2/3% or more, but less than 100%, of the Aggregate 
Commitment elect to be Continuing Banks, the Company may, at any time 
prior to the then applicable Extension Date, invite the Continuing 
Banks to increase their Commitments and/or invite other banks to become 
party to the Agreement in accordance with Section 13.3, in an aggregate 
amount not to exceed the Commitments of the Withdrawing Banks.  If the 
Company fails to receive new or increased Commitments equal to the 
Commitments of the Withdrawing Banks prior to the then applicable 
Extension Date, the Company may, at its option, elect to cancel the 
requested extension of the Revolving Credit Termination Date and the 
Banks, including the Withdrawing Banks, shall continue to be obligated 
to make Loans in accordance with the original terms of this Agreement 
(including any previously approved extensions).  If the Company receives 
66-2/3% or more, but less than 100%, of the Aggregate Commitment, and the 
Company elects not to cancel the requested extension, the Revolving Credit 
Termination Date shall be extended by one year, provided, however, that the 
Commitment of each Withdrawing Bank shall terminate on the then applicable 
Revolving Credit Termination Date without giving any effect to such 
 each Withdrawing Bank on such Revolving Credit Termination Date, 
provided, however, that so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists, 
the Company may, at any time prior to such Revolving Credit Termination 
Date and by not less than five Business Days' prior written notice to the 
Agent and any Withdrawing Bank, cancel such Bank's Commitment, and thereupon 
prepay all Loans made by such Bank, together with interest and fees accrued 
to the date of such prepayment and breakage costs due under Section 3.3, if 
any, whereupon such Bank shall cease to be obliged to make further Loans 
hereunder, its Commitment shall be reduced to zero and it shall be released 
from all unaccrued obligations under this Agreement. 
 
The Agent shall notify each Bank of its receipt of an Extension Notice 
within two Business Days after the Agent's receipt thereof.  The Company 
may deliver only one Extension Notice per year. 
 
          (b)  A Withdrawing Bank shall be obliged, at the request of the 
Company and subject to the Withdrawing Bank receiving payment in full of 
all amounts owing to it under this Agreement prior to completion of an 
assignment, to assign, without recourse or warranty and by an assignment 
agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit "J" attached hereto, and 
in accordance with Section 13.3, all of its rights and obligations 
hereunder to another financial institution which is an Eligible Assignee 
nominated by the Company and willing to participate in the facility in 
the place of such Withdrawing Bank; provided that such transferee satisfies 
all the requirements of this Agreement. 
 
          (c)  If the Revolving Credit Termination Date shall have been 
extended in respect of Continuing Banks in accordance with this Section 2.6, 
any Ratable Borrowing Notice or Notice of Conversion/Continuation specifying 
a Borrowing Date or Conversion/Continuation Date occurring after the 
Revolving Credit Termination Date applicable to a Withdrawing Bank or 
requesting an Interest Period extending beyond such date (i) shall have 
no effect in respect of such Withdrawing Bank and (ii) shall not specify 
a requested aggregate principal amount exceeding, when combined with all 
then outstanding Advances, the Aggregate Commitment calculated on the 
basis of the Commitments of the Continuing Banks. 
 
          (d)  If the Revolving Credit Termination Date shall have been 
extended in respect of Continuing Banks in accordance with this Section 2.6, 
all references herein to the "Revolving Credit Termination Date" shall, 
with respect to all parties hereto other than Withdrawing Banks, refer to 
the Revolving Credit Termination Date as so extended. 
 
     2.7.  Subsidiary Borrowers.  From time to time, the Company may 
designate Subsidiaries as Subsidiary Borrowers by delivering to the Agent 
a fully-executed original certificate in the form of Exhibit "L" hereto, 
together with all documents required by such certificate (in sufficient 
number for the Agent and each of the Banks), whereupon, upon the Agent's 
acknowledgment of receipt of same, such designated Subsidiaries shall be 
deemed Subsidiary Borrowers for all purposes hereof.  Until a Subsidiary 
so becomes a Subsidiary Borrower, it shall not be entitled to any Advances 
hereunder. 
 
 
                                    ARTICLE III 
 
                           TAXES, CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES 
 
     3.1.  Taxes.  (a)  Any and all payments by the Borrowers to each 
Bank or the Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document 
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding 
for, any Taxes.  In addition, the Borrowers severally agree to pay all 
Other Taxes. 
 
          (b)  If a Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or 
withhold any Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect 
of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank or the Agent, then: 
 
                   (i)  the sum payable shall be increased as necessary 
     so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings 
     (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional 
     sums payable under this Section), such Bank or the Agent, as the 
     case may be, receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it 
     would have received and retained had no such deductions or 
     withholdings been made; 
 
                 (ii)	  the Borrower shall make such deductions and 
     withholdings; 
 
                (iii)  the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted 
     or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority 
     in accordance with applicable law; and 
 
                 (iv)  the Borrower shall also pay to each Bank or the 
Agent for the account of such Bank, at the time interest is paid, Further 
Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank specifies as necessary to 
preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would have received if such Taxes, 
Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed. 
 
          (c)  The Borrowers severally agree to indemnify and hold 
harmless each Bank and the Agent for the full amount of i) Taxes, ii) 
Other Taxes, and iii) Further Taxes in the amount that the respective 
Bank specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Bank 
would have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not 
been imposed, and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions 
to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether 
or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes were correctly or legally 
asserted.  Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days 
after the date the Bank or the Agent makes written demand therefor. 
 
          (d)  Within 30 days after the date of any payment by any 
Borrower of Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Borrower shall 
furnish to each Bank or the Agent the original or a certified copy of a 
receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment 
satisfactory to such Bank or the Agent. 
 
     3.2.  Yield Protection.  If, after the date hereof, because of the 
enactment of, or any change in, any law or any governmental or quasi- 
governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether 
or not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof (other 
than such enactments or changes that are not effective as of June 1, 
1995 but are scheduled to become effective thereafter pursuant to such 
laws, rules, regulations, policies, guidelines, directives or interpretations 
that are effective as of June 1, 1995), which 
 
          (i)  imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, 
     assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement 
     against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit 
     extended by, any Bank or any applicable Lending Installation (other 
     than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the 
     interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate Advances), or 
 
         (ii)  imposes any other condition the result of which is to 
     increase the cost to any Bank or any applicable Lending Installation 
     of making, funding or maintaining loans or reduces any amount receivable 
     by any Bank or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with 
     loans, or requires any Bank or any applicable Lending Installation to 
     make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of loans held or 
     interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Bank, o 
 
          (iii)  affects the amount of capital required or expected to be 
     maintained by any Bank or Lending Installation or any corporation 
     controlling any Bank and such Bank determines the amount of capital 
     required is increased by or based upon the existence of this Agreement 
     or its obligation to make Loans hereunder or of commitments of this type, 
 
Then, within 15 days of demand by such Bank through the Agent, the Company 
shall pay such Bank that portion of such increased expense incurred 
(including, in the case of Section 3.2(iii), any reduction in the rate of 
return on capital to an amount below that which it could have achieved but 
for such law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive and after 
taking into account such Bank's policies as to capital adequacy) or reduction 
in an amount received which such Bank determines is attributable to making, 
funding and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if a Bank fails to make a claim within 90 days after it becomes, 
or ought reasonably to have become, aware of any event giving rise to a 
claim under this Section 3.2, then such Bank shall be entitled to make any 
claim under this Section 3.2 with respect to such Advance only in respect 
of any amounts due under this Section 3.2 that are attributable to the 
period following the 90th day preceding the day upon which the Bank makes 
such claim. 
 
     3.3.  Availability of Rate Options.  If any Bank determines that 
maintenance of any of its Fixed Rate Loans at a suitable Lending 
Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive, 
whether or not having the force of law, such Bank shall so notify the Agent 
and the Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Rate Option and 
require any Fixed Rate Advances outstanding under the affected Rate Option 
to be repaid; or if any Bank determines that (i) deposits of a type or 
maturity appropriate to match fund Fixed Rate Advances (other than 
Eurocurrency Advances) are not available, the Agent shall suspend the 
availability of the affected Rate Option with respect to any Fixed Rate 
Advances made after the date of any such determination, or (ii) a Rate 
Option does not accurately reflect the cost of making a Fixed Rate Advance, 
(other than a Eurocurrency Advance) at such Rate option, such Bank shall so 
notify the Agent and then the Agent shall suspend the availability of the 
affected Rate Option with respect to any Fixed Rate Advances made after the 
date of any such determination; or if any Bank determines that (iii) 
deposits of a type or maturity appropriate to match fund Eurocurrency 
Advances are not available to it or (iv) the Eurocurrency Rate does not 
accurately reflect the cost of making its Eurocurrency Loan, such Bank 
shall so notify the Agent and then the Agent shall suspend the availability 
of the Eurocurrency Rate for that particular Eurocurrency with respect to 
Eurocurrency Advances made after the date of such determination. 
 
     3.4.  Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a Fixed Rate 
Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable 
Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment, automatic 
conversion or otherwise, or the Borrower requests a Fixed Rate Advance, 
or the continuation or conversion of an Advance as or to a Fixed Rate 
Advance, and the Borrower does not borrow, continue or convert such Fixed 
Rate Advance on the date specified by the Borrower except by reason of 
default by the Banks, the Borrower will indemnify each Bank for any loss 
or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, 
any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or 
maintain the Fixed Rate Advance. 
 
     3.5.  Regulation D Compensation.  Each Bank may through the Agent 
request any Borrower to pay and upon such request the Borrower shall 
pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on such Borrower's 
Eurocurrency Loans and Eurodollar Ratable Loans, additional interest on 
such Loans at a rate per annum determined by such Bank up to but not 
exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable Base Eurocurrency Rate or 
Eurodollar Base Rate, as the case may be, divided by (B) one minus the 
Reserve Requirement with respect to Eurocurrency liabilities over (ii) the 
applicable Base Eurocurrency Rate or Eurodollar Base Rate, as the case may 
be.  Any Bank wishing to require payment of such additional interest (v) 
shall so notify the Borrowers and the Agent, in which case such additional 
interest on the Eurocurrency Loans and Eurodollar Ratable Loans of such 
Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the place indicated in such notice 
with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least five Business 
Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrowers at 
least five Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable 
on the Eurocurrency Loans and the Eurodollar Ratable Loans of the amount 
then due it under this Section. 
 
     3.6.  Bank Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent 
reasonably possible, each Bank shall designate an alternate Lending 
Installation with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans to reduce any liability 
of the Borrowers to such Bank under Section 3.1 or 3.2 or to avoid the 
unavailability of a Rate Option under Section 3.3, so long as such 
designation is not disadvantageous to such Bank.  Each Bank shall deliver 
to the Borrowers through the Agent a written statement of such Bank as to 
the amount due, if any, under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4, simultaneously 
with making a request for payment under said Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4.  
Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations 
upon which such Bank determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive 
and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.  Determination 
of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Fixed Rate Loan 
shall be calculated as though each Bank funded its Fixed Rate Loan through the 
purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit 
used as a reference in determining the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan, 
whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, 
the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable on demand after 
receipt by the Borrowers of the written statement.  The Obligations of the 
Borrowers under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the 
Obligations and termination of this Agreement. 
 
     3.7.  Removal of Banks.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or 
continue any Loans as, or convert Loans to, Eurocurrency Loans or Eurodollar 
Ratable Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or (ii) any Bank 
has demanded compensation under Section 3.1 or 3.2, the Company may elect 
to terminate this Agreement as to such Bank, provided that (i) the Company 
notifies such Bank through the Agent of such election at least five Business 
Days before any date fixed for a borrowing, (ii) the Company repays all of 
such Bank's Outstanding Obligations at the end of the respective Interest 
Periods applicable thereto and (iii) no Default or Unmatured Default exists. 
Upon receipt by the Agent of such notice, the Commitment of such Bank shall 
terminate.

           writing by the Company. 
 
     (v)   A written opinion of the Company's in-house counsel, addressed 
           to the Agent and the Banks in substantially the form of Exhibit

           thereunder. 
 
     (x)   Such other documents as any Bank or its counsel may have 
           reasonably requested prior to execution of the Agreement. 
 
     4.2.  Each Advance.  The Banks shall not be required to make any 
Advance, unless on the applicable Borrowing Date:  
 
     (i)  There exists no Default or Unmatured Default. 
 
     (ii) The representations and warranties contained in Article 
          V are true and correct as of such Borrowing Date except for

     Each Ratable Borrowing Notice or Competitive Bid Quote Request with 
respect to each such Advance shall constitute a representation and warranty 
by the Company that the conditions contained in Sections 4.2(i) and (ii) 
have been satisfied. 
 
 
                                  ARTICLE V
 
                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 
     The Borrowers severally represent and warrant to the Banks that: 
 
     5.1.  Corporate Existence.  Each of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries 
is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of 
its jurisdiction of incorporation and is duly qualified and has all requisite 
authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business 
is conducted. 
 
     5.2.  Authorization and Validity.  The Borrowers each have the 
corporate power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the 
Loan Documents and to perform their Obligations thereunder.  The execution 
and delivery by the Borrowers of the Loan Documents and the performance 
of their Obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper 
corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents constitute legal, valid 
and binding Obligations of the Borrowers enforceable against the Borrowers 
in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited 
by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of 
creditors' rights generally. 
 
     5.3.  No Conflict; Government Consent.  Neither the execution 
and delivery by the Borrowers of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation 
of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the 
provisions thereof will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, 
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrowers or any 
Subsidiary or any Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles of incorporation 
or bylaws or the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to 
which any Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject, or by which 
it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default 
thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or 
on the property of any Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of 
any such indenture, instrument or agreement.  No order, consent, approval, 
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or 
registration with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or 
authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is 
required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, or 
the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan 
Documents. 
 
     5.4.  Financial Statements.  The May 31, 1995, consolidated 
financial statements of the Company and the Subsidiaries heretofore 
delivered to the Banks were prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared 
and fairly present the consolidated financial condition and operations of the 
Company and the Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of 
their operations for the period then ended. 
 
     5.5.  Material Adverse Change.  Since May 31, 1995, there has been no 
change in the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or 
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries which could have 
a Material Adverse Effect. 
 
     5.6.  Taxes.  The Company and the Subsidiaries have filed all United 
States federal tax returns and all other United States and foreign tax 
returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant 
to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Company or 
any Subsidiary, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good 
faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided.  The United 
States income tax returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries have been 
audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended 
May 31, 1992.  No tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted 
with respect to any such taxes.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the 
books of the Company and the Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other 
governmental charges are adequate. 
 
     5.7.  Litigation and Contingent Obligations.  There is no 
litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or 
inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened 
against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary which might materially 
adversely affect the business, properties, financial condition prospects, 
or results of operations of the Company or the ability of the Company to 
perform its Obligations under the Loan Documents.  The Company has no 
material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the 
financial statements referred to in Section 5.4. 
 
     5.8.  Subsidiaries.  Schedule "1" hereto contains an accurate 
list of all of the presently existing Subsidiaries of the Company, 
setting forth their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and the 
percentage of their respective capital stock owned by the Company or other 
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date.  All of the issued and outstanding 
shares of capital stock of such Subsidiaries have been duly authorized 
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.  Each of the Borrowers 
(other than the Company) is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary. 
 
     5.9.  ERISA.  There are no material Unfunded Liabilities.  Each 
Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements 
of law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to 
any Plan, neither the Company nor any other members of the Controlled 
Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no 
steps have been taken to terminate any Plan. 
 
     5.10.  Accuracy of Information.  No information, exhibit or report 
furnished by the Company or any Subsidiary to the Agent or to any Bank 
in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan 
Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state 
a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained 
therein not misleading. 
 
     5.11.  Regulation U.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns 
any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U). 
 
     5.12.  Material Agreements.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary 
is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or 
other corporate restriction which might have a Material Adverse Effect.  
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance, 
observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or 
conditions contained in (i) any agreement to which it is a party, which 
default might have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement or 
instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness. 
 
     5.13.  Compliance With Laws.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have 
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and 
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality 
or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective 
businesses or the ownership of their respective properties where failure to 
comply might have a Material Adverse Effect. 
 
     5.14.  Ownership of Properties.  Except as set forth on Schedule "2" 
hereto, on the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries 
will have good title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by 
Section 6.15, to all of the properties and assets reflected in the financial 
statements as owned by it. 
 
     5.15.  Post-Retirement Benefits.  The amount of the present value of the 
expected cost of post-retirement medical and insurance benefits payable by 
the Company and its Subsidiaries to its employees and former employees, as 
estimated by the Company in accordance with reasonable procedures and 
assumptions, is not material to the financial condition of the Company. 
 
     5.16.  Environmental and Safety and Health Matters.  To the best 
of the knowledge of the Company, the Company and each Subsidiary are 
in compliance with all Environmental Laws and Occupational and Health Laws 
where failure to comply would reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations 
hereunder.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received notice of 
any claims that any of them is not in compliance in all material respects 
with the Environmental Laws where failure to comply would reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Company 
to perform its Obligations. 
 
 
                                   ARTICLE VI 
 
                                   COVENANTS 
 
     During the term of this Agreement, unless the Required Banks shall 
otherwise consent in writing: 
 
     6.1.  Financial Reporting.  The Company will maintain, for itself 
and each Subsidiary, a system of accounting established and administered 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and furnish 
to the Agent with sufficient copies for each Bank: 
 
     (i)   Within 120 days after the close of each of its fiscal 
           years, an unqualified audit report certified by independent 
           certified public accountants, acceptable to the Banks, 
           prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
           principles on a consolidated basis for itself and the 
           Subsidiaries, including balance sheets as of the end of 
           such period, related profit and loss and reconciliation of 
           surplus statements, and a statement of cash flows. 
 
   (ii)    Within 60 days after the close of each of the first three 
           quarterly periods of each of its fiscal years, for itself 
           and the Subsidiaries, a consolidated unaudited balance sheet 
           as at the close of such period, and a consolidated profit 
           and loss statement and a consolidated statement of cash 
           flows for the period from the beginning of such fiscal year 
           to the end of such quarter, all certified by its chief 
           financial officer. 
 
     (iii) Together with the financial statements required hereunder,

           Agreement and stating that no Default or Unmatured Default 
           exists, or if any Default or Unmatured Default exists, stating 
           the nature and status thereof. 
 
     (iv)  Promptly upon the furnishing thereof to the shareholders of 
           the Company, copies of all financial statements, reports and 
           proxy statements so furnished. 
 
      (v)  Promptly upon the filing thereof, copies of all S-1's, 10-Ks

expects will have a Material Adverse Effect or would materially adversely 
affect the ability of the Company to repay the Obligations and (iii) receipt 
of any notice that the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary are not 
in compliance with requirements of any applicable Environmental Law or any 
Occupational Safety and Health Law where failure to comply would reasonably

to perform its Obligations hereunder, or receipt of notice that any properties 
or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary are subject to an Environmental 
Lien securing obligations in excess of $5,000,000.  As used herein, 
"Environmental Lien" means a Lien in favor of any governmental entity for 
(i) any liability under any Environmental Law, or (ii) damages arising from 
or costs incurred by such governmental entity in response to a spillage, 
disposal or release into the environment of any hazardous or toxic substance.

Subsidiary into the Company or any other Subsidiary; provided, however,

or dissolve into a Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Borrower or Material 
Subsidiary.  The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to,

which adequate reserves have been set aside. 
 
     6.6.  Insurance.  The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary

Subsidiary owns, is licensed or otherwise has the lawful right to use, 
and will continue to own, be licensed or have the lawful right to use, 
all permits and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade 
names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes used in or 
necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted.  The 
use of such permits and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, 
trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by the 
Company and each of its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of 
any Person. 
 
     6.9.  Inspection.  Subject to Section 10.12 hereof, the Company will, 
and will cause each Subsidiary to, permit the Agent or any Bank, by their

to examine and make copies of the books of accounts and other financial 
records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and to discuss the affairs, 
finances and accounts of the Company and each Subsidiary with, and to be

    (iii)  Liens arising out of pledges or deposits under worker's 
           compensation laws, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, 
           or other social security or retirement benefits, or similar 
           legislation. 
 
     (iv)  Utility easements, building restrictions and such other 
           encumbrances or charges against real property as are of a

           use thereof in the business of the Company or the Subsidiaries. 
 
     (v)   Liens existing on the date hereof and described in Schedule "2" 
           hereto.

                                   ARTICLE VIII 
 
                  ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES 
 
     8.1.  Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.5, 
7.6 or 7.7 occurs with respect to any Borrower, the obligations of the 
Banks to make Loans to that Borrower hereunder shall automatically 
terminate and the Obligations of such Borrower shall immediately become 
due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent 
or any Bank.  If any Default described in Section 7.5, 7.6 or 7.7 occurs 
with respect to the Company, the obligations of the Banks to make Loans 
to any Borrower hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations 
of all the Borrowers shall immediately become due and payable without any 
election or action on the part of the Agent or any Bank.  If any Default 
occurs, the Required Banks may terminate or suspend the Obligations of the 
Banks to make Loans to any and all Borrowers hereunder, or declare the 
Obligations of any and all Borrowers to be due and payable, or both, 
whereupon such Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, 
without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which 
the Borrowers hereby each expressly waive. 
 
     If, within 14 days after acceleration of the maturity of the 
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Banks to make Loans 
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described 
in Section 7.5, 7.6, or 7.7 with respect to any Borrower or 7.10 with 
respect to the Company) and before any judgment or decree for the payment 
of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required 
Banks (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Agent shall, by notice 
to the Borrowers, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination. 
 
     8.2.  Amendments.  Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, 
the Required Banks (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the 
Required Banks) and the Borrowers may enter into agreements supplemental 
hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan 
Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or the 
Borrowers hereunder or waiving any Default hereunder; provided, however, 
that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each 
Bank affected thereby: 
 
     (i)   Extend the scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note or reduce 
           the principal amount thereof (other than as permitted by this 
           Agreement), or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment 
           of interest or fees thereon. 
 
     (ii)  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of 
           Required Banks. 
 
    (iii)  Subject to Section 2.6, extend the Revolving Credit 
           Termination Date, or increase the amount of the Commitment 
           of any Bank hereunder, or permit any Borrower to assign 
           its rights under this Agreement. 
 
     (iv)  Amend or waive the provisions of Article IV. 
 
      (v)  Amend this Section 8.2. 
 
No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent 
shall be effective without the written consent of the Agent.  The Agent 
may waive payment of the fee required under Section 10.7(a) without 
obtaining the consent of any of the Banks. 
 
     8.3.  Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Banks 
or the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair 
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence 
therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a 
Default or the inability of the Company to satisfy the conditions precedent 
to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single 
or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further 
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, 
amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of 
the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by 
the Banks and the Agent required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only 
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies 
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative 
and all shall be available to the Agent and the Banks until the Obligations 
have been paid in full. 
 
                                  ARTICLE IX 
 
                                   GUARANTY 
 
     9.1.  Guaranty.  The Company hereby irrevocably, absolutely 
and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment or performance 
when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, 
acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all of the Obligations of each 
Subsidiary Borrower (the "Guaranteed Obligations").  This guaranty 
constitutes a guaranty of payment and performance when due and not of 
collection, and the Company specifically agrees that it shall not be 
necessary or required that the Agent or any Bank exercise any right, 
assert any claim or demand or enforce any remedy whatsoever against any 
Subsidiary Borrower (or any other Person) before or as a condition to the 
obligations of the Company under this Article IX.  The Agent or any Bank 
may permit the indebtedness of any Subsidiary Borrower to the Agent or any 
Bank to include indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Obligations, and 
may apply any amounts received from any source, other than from the Company, 
to that portion of Subsidiary Borrowers' indebtedness to the Agent or any 
Bank which is not a part of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
 
     9.2.  Obligations Independent. The obligations under this Article IX 
are independent of the Obligations of the Subsidiary Borrowers, and, if 
the Company fails to pay when due any amount owing under this Article 
IX, a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against 
the Company whether action is brought against the Subsidiary Borrowers or 
whether the Subsidiary Borrowers be joined in any such action or actions. 
 
     9.3.  Authorization of Renewals, Etc The Company authorizes the Agent 
and each Bank, without notice or demand and without affecting its liability 
hereunder, from time to time: to renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or 
otherwise change the time for payment, or otherwise change the terms, of the 
Guaranteed Obligations, including increase or decrease of the rate of interest 
thereon. 
 
     9.4.  Waiver of Certain Rights. The Company waives any right to require 
the Agent or any Bank (a) to proceed against the Subsidiary Borrowers or any 
other Person; (b) to proceed against or exhaust any security for the 
Guaranteed Obligations or any other indebtedness of the Subsidiary Borrowers 
to the Agent or any Bank; or (c) to pursue any other remedy in the Agent's 
or any such Bank's power whatsoever. 
 
     9.5.  Waiver of Certain Defenses. The Company waives all suretyship 
defenses, any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense 
of the Subsidiary Borrowers, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of 
the liability of the Subsidiary Borrowers, whether consensual or arising by 
operation of law or any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor relief proceeding, 
ore burdensome than those of the Subsidiary Borrowers.  The Company waives 
all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Agent 
or any Bank.  The Company waives all presentments, demands for performance, 
notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor 
and notices of acceptance of this guaranty.  In connection with any action 
against the Company seeking to enforce the terms of this Article IX, the 
Company agrees that it may not assert as a defense that the underlying 
obligation of the Subsidiary Obligor is not enforceable against such 
Subsidiary Borrower by reason of any statute of limitations applicable 
to such underlying obligation. 
 
     9.6.  Information Relating to Company. The Company acknowledges 
and agrees that it shall have the sole responsibility for obtaining 
from the Subsidiary Borrowers such information concerning the Subsidiary 
Borrowers' financial condition or business operations as the Company 
may require, and that neither the Agent nor any Bank has any duty at any 
time to disclose to the Company any information relating to the business 
operations or financial condition of the Subsidiary Borrowers. 
 
     9.7.  Subordination. Any obligations of the Subsidiary Borrowers 
to the Company, now or hereafter existing, constituting obligations to 
the Company as subrogee of the Agent or any Bank or resulting from the 
Company's performance under this Article IX, are hereby fully 
subordinated in time and priority of payment to the Guaranteed 
Obligations. 
 
     9.8.  Reinstatement of Guaranty. If any payment or transfer of 
any interest in property by any Subsidiary Borrower to the Agent or 
any Bank in fulfillment of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or 
must at any time (including after the termination or cancellation of 
this guaranty) be returned, in whole or in part, by the Agent or any 
Bank to the Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person, upon the insolvency, 
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Subsidiary Borrower or otherwise, this 
guaranty shall be reinstated with respect to any such payment or transfer, 
regardless of any such prior return or cancellation. 
 
     9.9.  Power and Authority of Subsidiary Borrowers. The Company 
acknowledges that none of the Agent or any Bank has inquired into the 
power or authority of any Subsidiary Borrower to execute and deliver 
this Agreement or the Notes or to borrow any Advance hereunder, or of 
any officer, director or agent acting or purporting to act on behalf of 
any Subsidiary Borrower to do any of the foregoing.  The Company agrees 
that it is not necessary for the Agent or any Bank to inquire into any 
such power and authority, and that any Guaranteed Obligation made or 
created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such power and authority 
of a Subsidiary Borrower, or of any officer, director or agent acting or 
purporting to act on behalf of any Subsidiary Borrower, shall be guaranteed 
hereunder.

warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive 
delivery of the Notes and the making of the Loans herein contemplated.

Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Bank shall be obligated to 
extend credit to the Company in violation of any limitation or prohibition 
provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 
 
     10.3.  Taxes.  Any taxes (excluding income taxes) or other similar 
assessments or charges payable or ruled payable by any governmental 
authority in respect of the Loan Documents shall be paid by the Company, 
together with interest and penalties, if any. 
 
     10.4.  Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for

any of the provisions of the Loan Documents. 
 
     10.5.  Entire Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire 
agreement and understanding among the Borrowers, the Agent and the Banks 
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrowers, 
the Agent and the Banks relating to the subject matter thereof. 
 
     10.6.  Several Obligations.  The respective Obligations of the 
Banks hereunder are several and not joint and no Bank shall be the partner 
or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Agent is authorized 
to act as such).  The failure of any Bank to perform any of its Obligations 
hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank from any of its Obligations 
hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right 
or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement 
and their respective successors and assigns. 
 
     10.7.  Expenses; Indemnification.  (a) The Company shall reimburse 
the Agent for the costs and expenses incurred in the preparation, 
execution and administration of the Loan Documents as set forth in a 
letter agreement between the Agent and the Company dated July 14, 1995.  
b) The Borrowers jointly and severally shall reimburse the Agent and each 
Bank for all itemized, reasonable costs and expenses (including attorney's 
fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent and each Bank, which 
attorneys may be employees of a Bank) (hereinafter, collectively, 
"Attorney Costs") paid or incurred in connection with the collection and 
enforcement of the Loan Documents during the existence of a Default or 
after acceleration of the Advances (including in connection with any 
"workout" or restructuring regarding the Advances, and including in any 
insolvency proceeding).  The Borrowers jointly and severally further 
agree to indemnify the Agent, the Arranger, and each Bank, its directors, 
officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, 
judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all 
expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Agent 
or any Bank is a party thereto, including Attorney Costs) which any of 
them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the 
other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct 
or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any 
Loan hereunder (together, "Indemnified Liabilities"), subject to Oregon 
Revised Statutes  20.096.  The Obligations of the Borrowers under this 
Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
 
     10.8.  Numbers of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing 
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with 
sufficient counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the

fiscal year or in the accounting principles and methods used in preparing 
its financial statements. 
 
     10.10.  Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan 
Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in 
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, 
unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in

provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of 
all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. 
 
     10.11.  Nonliability of Banks.  The relationship between the Borrowers 
and the Banks and the Agent with respect to this Agreement shall be solely 
that of borrower and lender.  Neither the Agent nor any Bank shall have 
any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrowers with respect to this 
Agreement.  Neither the Agent nor any Bank undertakes under this Agreement 
any responsibility to the Borrowers to review or inform the Borrowers 
of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers' business 
or operations. 
 
     10.12.  Confidentiality.  The Agent and each Bank agrees to hold any 
non-public information which it may receive from the Borrowers pursuant 
to this Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure (i) to other Banks 
and their respective affiliates involved with the administration, 
syndication, agency and any similar functions with respect to the Loan 
Documents, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other professional 
advisors to that Bank, (iii) to regulatory officials, (iv) as requested 
pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or legal process, (v) in 
connection with any legal proceeding to which that Bank is a party, and 
(vi) permitted by Section 13.4.

CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF OREGON BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS 
APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS. 
 
     10.14.  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWERS EACH HEREBY 
IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES 
FEDERAL OR OREGON STATE COURT SITTING IN PORTLAND, OREGON IN ANY ACTION

AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO 
THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT

COMPANY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.  ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING 
BY ANY BORROWERS AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY BANK OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE 
AGENT OR ANY BANK INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY

BANK HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING,

ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER. 
 
     10.16.  OREGON LEGAL NOTICE.  UNDER OREGON LAW, MOST AGREEMENTS, 
PROMISES AND COMMITMENTS MADE BY US AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ACT 
CONCERNING LOANS AND OTHER CREDIT EXTENSIONS WHICH ARE NOT FOR PERSONAL, 
FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES OR SECURED SOLELY BY THE BORROWER'S RESIDENCE 
MUST BE IN WRITING, EXPRESS CONSIDERATION AND BE SIGNED BY US TO BE 
ENFORCEABLE.  THE TERM "THIS ACT" MEANS CHAPTER 967 OREGON LAWS 1989.  
THE TERM "US" MEANS THE AGENT AND THE BANKS.  THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS 
ACT IS OCTOBER 3, 1989. 
 
     10.17.  Several Obligations.  Unless otherwise expressly provided 
herein, all Obligations of the Borrowers are several and not joint. 
 
                                   ARTICLE XI 
 
                                   THE AGENT 
 
     11.1.  Appointment and Authorization; "Agent".  Each Bank hereby 
irrevocably (subject to Section 11.9) appoints, designates and authorizes 
the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this 
Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and 
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers 
as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision 
to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other 
Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, 
except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be 
deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied 
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or 
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
or otherwise exist against the Agent.  Without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement 
with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary 
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine 
of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter 
of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an 
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
 
     11.2.  Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its 
duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through 
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice 
of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  The 
Agent shall not be responsible to any Bank for the negligence or 
misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with 
reasonable care. 
 
     11.3.  Liability of Agent.  None of the Agent-Related Persons 
shall (i) be liable to any Bank for any action taken or omitted to be 
taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for 
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible 
in any manner to any of the Banks for any recital, statement, 
representation or warranty made by the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or 
Affiliate of the Company, or any officer thereof, contained in this 
Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, 
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received 
by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability 
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any 
failure of the Company or any other party to any Loan Document to perform 
its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent-Related Person shall 
be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the 
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or 
conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect 
the properties, books or records of the Borrowers or any of the Borrowers' 
Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 
 
     11.4.  Reliance by Agent.  (a)  The Agent shall be entitled to 
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, 
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex 
or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed 
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the 
proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel 
(including counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other 
experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing 
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the 
Required Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall 
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and 
all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking 
or continuing to take any such action.  The Agent shall in all cases be 
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or 
consent of the Required Banks and such request and any action taken or 
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks. 
 
          (b)  For purposes of determining compliance with the 
conditions specified in Section 4.1, each Bank that has executed 
this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or 
accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either 
sent by the Agent to such Bank for consent, approval, acceptance or 
satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by 
or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank. 
 
     11.5.  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have 
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default, 
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest 
and fees required to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, 
unless the Agent shall have received written notice from a Bank or the 
Borrowers referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or 
Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  
The Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of any such notice.  The 
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Unmatured 
Default as may be requested by the Required Banks in accordance with 
Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has 
received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated 
to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect 
to such Default or Unmatured Default as it shall deem advisable or in 
the best interest of the Banks. 
 
     11.6.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that none of the 
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, 
and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of 
the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to 
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to 
any Bank.  Each Bank represents to the Agent that it has, independently 
and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such 
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own 
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, 
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the 
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws 
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own 
decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company 
hereunder.  Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and 
without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents 
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to 
make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not 
taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to 
make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the 
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition 
and creditworthiness of the Borrowers.  Except for notices, reports and 
other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by 
the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide 
any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, 
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or 
creditworthiness of the Borrowers which may come into the possession 
of any of the Agent-Related Persons. 
 
     11.7.  Indemnification of Agent.  Whether or not the transactions 
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand 
the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf 
of the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Company to 
do so), pro rata, from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; 
provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to the 
Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities 
resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful 
misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall 
reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or 
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent 
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, 
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, 
legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of 
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan 
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to 
the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on 
behalf of the Borrowers.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive 
the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement 
of the Agent. 
 
     11.8.  Agent in Individual Capacity.  BofA and its Affiliates 
may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept 
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in 
any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other 
business with the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates as 
though BofA were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to or 
consent of the Banks.  The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such 
activities, BofA or its Affiliates may receive information regarding 
the Borrowers or their Affiliates (including information that may be 
subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrowers or 
such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no 
obligation to provide such information to them.  With respect to its 
Loans, BofA shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement 
as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the 
Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" include BofA in its individual 
capacity. 
 
     11.9.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may, and at the request of 
the Required Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the 
Banks.  If the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Banks 
shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks.  
If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the 
resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with 
the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from among the Banks.  
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, 
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties 
of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor 
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent 
shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder 
as Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and Section 10.7 shall 
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by 
it while it was Agent under this Agreement.  If no successor agent has 
accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a 
retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation 
shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform 
all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the 
Required Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above. 
 
     11.10.  Withholding Tax.  (a) If any Bank is a "foreign corporation, 
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Bank claims 
exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 
1441 or 1442 of the Code, such Bank agrees with and in favor of the Agent, 
to deliver to the Agent: 
 
          (i)  if such Bank claims an exemption from, or a reduction of, 
     withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, two properly 
     completed and executed copies of IRS Form 1001 before the payment 
     of any interest in the first calendar year and before the payment 
     of any interest in each third succeeding calendar year during which 
     interest may be paid under this Agreement; 
 
        (ii)  if such Bank claims that interest paid under this 
     Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because 
     it is effectively connected with a United States trade or business 
     of such Bank, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form 
     4224 before the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable 
     year of such Bank and in each succeeding taxable year of such Bank 
     during which interest may be paid under this Agreement; and 
 
       (iii)  such other form or forms as may be required under the 
     Code or other laws of the United States as a condition to 
     exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax. 
 
     Such Bank agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in 
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption 
or reduction. 
 
     (b)  If any Bank claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding 
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001 and such 
Bank sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers 
all or part of the Obligations of the Borrowers to such Bank, such Bank 
agrees to notify the Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no 
longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of the Borrowers to such Bank.  
To the extent of such percentage amount, the Agent will treat such Bank's 
IRS Form 1001 as no longer valid. 
 
(     c)  If any Bank claiming exemption from United States 
withholding tax by filing IRS Form 4224 with the Agent sells, 
assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all 
or part of the Obligations of the Borrowers to such Bank, such 
Bank agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the 
withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of 
the Code. 
 
          (d)  If any Bank is entitled to a reduction in the 
applicable withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest 
payment to such Bank an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding 
tax after taking into account such reduction.  However, if the forms or 
other documentation required by subsection (a) of this Section are not 
delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold from any interest 
payment to such Bank not providing such forms or other documentation an 
amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 
1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction. 
 
          (e)  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the 
United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did 
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any 
Bank (because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly 
executed, or because such Bank failed to notify the Agent of a change in 
circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding 
tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify 
the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the 
Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including 
any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent 
under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including 
Attorney Costs).  The obligation of the Banks under this subsection shall 
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement 
of the Agent. 
 
                                  ARTICLE XII 
 
                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS 
 
     12.1.  Setoff.  In addition to, and without limitation of, 
any rights of the Banks under applicable law, if any Borrower becomes 
insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default or Unmatured Default 
occurs, any indebtedness from any Bank to the Borrower (including all 
account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not 
collected or available) may be offset and applied toward the payment 
of the Obligations owing to such Bank, whether or not the Obligations, 
or any part hereof, shall then be due. 
 
     12.2.  Ratable Payments.  If any Bank, whether by setoff or 
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans in a greater proportion 
than that received by any other Bank (except as specifically contemplated 
by the terms of this Agreement), such Bank agrees, promptly upon demand, 
to purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Banks so that after 
such purchase each Bank will hold its ratable proportion of Loans.  If 
any Bank, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be 
subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection 
for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to set off, such 
Bank agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that 
all Banks share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion 
to their Loans.  In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, 
or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. 
 
 
                              ARTICLE XIII 
 
              BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
 
     13.1.  Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the 
Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the 
Company and the Banks and their respective successors and assigns, except 
that the Borrowers shall not have the right to assign their rights or 
Obligations under the Loan Documents and any assignment by any Bank must 
be made in compliance with Section 13.3.  The Agent may treat the payee 
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and 
until such payee complies with Section 13.3 in the case of an assignment 
thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the 
transfer is filed with the Agent.  Any assignee or transferee of a Note 
agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms and provisions 
of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person, 
who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or 
consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding on 
any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any 
Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor. 
 
     13.2.  Participations. 
 
          13.2.1.  Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Bank may, in 
     the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in 
     accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more 
     banks or other financial institutions ("Participants") participating 
     interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such 
     Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or any other interest of such 
     Bank under the Loan Documents.  Participations in Competitive Bid 
     Loans may be sold to any entity.  In the event of any such sale by 
     a Bank of participating interests to a Participant, such Bank's 
     Obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such 
     Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto 
     for the performance of such Obligations, such Bank shall remain 
     the holder of any such Note for all purposes under the Loan 
     Documents, all amounts payable by the Company under this Agreement 
     shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such participating 
     interests, and the Company and the Agent shall continue to deal 
     solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's 
     rights and Obligations under the Loan Documents. 
 
          13.2.2.  Voting Rights.  Each Bank shall retain the sole right 
     to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, 
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other 
     than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan 
     or Commitment in which such Participant has an Interest which 
     forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate 
     or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, 
     postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of 
     principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan or Commitment, 
     releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases any substantial 
     portion of collateral, if any, securing any such Loan. 
 
          13.2.3.  Benefit of Setoff.  The Borrowers each agree that 
     each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided 
     in Section 12.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts 
     owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount 
     of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Bank 
     under the Loan Documents, provided that each Bank shall retain the 
     right of setoff provided in Section 12.1 with respect to the amount 
     of participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Banks agree 
     to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising 
     the right of setoff provided in Section 12.1, agrees to share with 
     each Bank, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right 
     of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 12.2 
     as if each Participant were a Bank. 
 
     13.3.  Assignments.

     such consent shall be necessary in connection with assignments to 
     Purchaser that are Affiliates of such Bank and provided further that 
     no consent of the Company shall be required if there exists a Default), 
     at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees ("Purchasers") 
     all or any part of its rights and Obligations, ratably, under the 
     Loan Documents, provided that each assignment shall be in a minimum 
     principal amount of $15,000,000 and in increments of $1,000,000 in 
     excess thereof (or, if less, the remaining amount of Loans held by 
     the assignor) and further provided, that assignments of Competitive 
     Bid Loans may be made to any entity on a ratable or non-ratable 
     basis.  Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of 
     Exhibit "J" hereto.  Such consent shall be substantially in the 
     form attached as Exhibit "2" to Exhibit "J" hereto.

     as Exhibit "1" to Exhibit "J" hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), 
     together with any consents required by Section 13.3.1, and (ii) 
     payment of a $2,500 fee to the Agent from the assignor for processing 
     such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the 
     effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment.  On and 
     after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall 
     for all purposes be a Bank party to this Agreement and any other 
     Loan Document executed by the Banks and shall have all the rights 
     and Obligations of a Bank under the Loan Documents, to the same 
     extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent 
     or action by the Company, the Banks or the Agent shall be required 
     to release the transferor Bank with respect to the percentage of 
     the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser.  
     Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant 
     to this Section 13.3.2, the transferor Bank, the Agent and the 
     Company shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement 
     Notes are issued to such transferor Bank and new Notes or, as 
     appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in 
     each case in principal amounts reflecting their Commitment, as 
     adjusted pursuant to such assignment. 
 
     13.4.  Dissemination of Information.  The Company authorizes 
each Bank to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other 
Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of 
law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all 
information in such Bank's possession concerning the creditworthiness 
of the Company and the Subsidiaries, provided that such Transferee or 
prospective Transferee executes a Confidentiality Agreement in the form 
of Exhibit "K" hereto.

                              ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT 
 
 
     This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between     
              (the "Assignor") and                     (the "Assignee") 
is dated as of            , 19  .  The parties hereto agree as follows: 
 
     1.     PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.  The Assignor is a party to a Credit 
Agreement, dated as of September 15, 1995 (which, as it may be amended, 
modified, renewed or extended from time to time, is herein called the 
"Credit Agreement"), among NIKE, Inc. (the "Company"), certain of its 
Subsidiaries, certain banks party thereto and Bank of America National 
Trust and Savings Association, as agent for such banks.  Capitalized 
terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the 
meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.  The Assignor 
desires to assign to the Assignee, and the Assignee desires to assume 
from the Assignor, an undivided interest (the "Purchased Percentage") 
in the Commitment of the Assignor such that after giving effect to the 
assignment and assumption hereinafter provided, the Commitment of the 
Assignee shall equal $             and its percentage of the Aggregate 
Commitment shall equal     %. 
 
     2.     ASSIGNMENT.  For and in consideration of the assumption of 
obligations by the Assignee set forth in Section 3 hereof and the other 
consideration set forth herein, and effective as of the Effective Date 
(as hereinafter defined), the Assignor does hereby sell, assign, 
transfer and convey all of its right, title and interest in and to the 
Purchased Percentage of (i) the Commitment of the Assignor (as in effect 
on the Effective Date), (ii) any Loan constituting part of a Ratable 
Advance [or part of any Competitive Bid Advance] outstanding on the 
Effective Date and (iii) the Credit Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents [other than the Competitive Bid Note payable to Assignor] 
[(the "Transferred Documents")].  Pursuant to Section 13.3 of the Credit 
Agreement, on and after the Effective Date the Assignee shall have the 
same rights, benefits and obligations as the Assignor had under the Loan 
Documents [Transferred Documents] with respect to the Purchased Percentage 
of the Loan Documents [Transferred Documents], all determined as if the 
Assignee were a "Bank" under the Credit Agreement with ___% of the 
Aggregate Commitment.  The Effective Date shall be the later of        
     or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by the Agent) 
after a Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit "1" 
attached hereto and any consents substantially in the form of Exhibit 
"2" attached hereto required to be delivered to the Agent by Section 
13.3 of the Credit Agreement have been delivered to the Agent.  In no 
event will the Effective Date occur if the payments required to be made 
by the Assignee to the Assignor on the Effective Date under Section 4 
and 5 hereof are not made on the proposed Effective Date.  The Assignor 
will notify the Assignee of the proposed Effective Date on the Business 
Day prior to the proposed Effective Date. 
 
     3.     ASSUMPTION.  For and in consideration of the assignment of 
rights by the Assignor set forth in Section 2 hereof and the other 
consideration set forth herein, and effective as of the Effective Date, 
the Assignee does hereby accept that assignment, and assume and covenant 
and agree fully, completely and timely to perform, comply with and 
discharge, each and all of the obligations, duties and liabilities of 
the Assignor under the Credit Agreement which are assigned to the 
Assignee hereunder, which assumption includes, without limitation, 
the obligation to fund the unfunded portion of the Aggregate Commitment 
in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement as 
if the Assignee were a "Bank" under the Credit Agreement with     % of 
he Aggregate Commitment.  The Assignee agrees to be bound by all 
provisions relating to "Banks" under and as defined in the Credit 
Agreement, including, without limitation, provisions relating to the 
dissemination of information and the payment of indemnification. 
 
     4.     PAYMENTS OBLIGATIONS.  On and after the Effective Date, 
the Assignee shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all payments 
of principal, interest and fees with respect to the Purchased 
Percentage of the Assignor's Commitment and Loans [constituting part 
of any Ratable Advances].  The Assignee shall advance funds directly to 
the Agent with respect to all such Loans and reimbursement payments made 
on or after the Effective Date.  In consideration for the sale and 
assignment of such Loans hereunder, (i) with respect to all Floating 
Rate Loans made by the Assignor outstanding on the Effective Date, the 
Assignee shall pay the Assignor, on the Effective Date,[ an amount equal 
to the Purchased Percentage of all such Floating Rate Loans; and (ii) 
with respect to each Fixed Rate Loan made by the Assignor outstanding 
on the Effective Date, (a) on the last day of the Interest Period 
therefor or (b) on such earlier date agreed to by the Assignor and the 
Assignee or (c) on the date on which any such Fixed Rate Loan either 
becomes due (by acceleration or otherwise) or is prepaid (the date as 
described in the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c) being hereinafter 
referred to as the "Payment Date")]*, the Assignee shall pay the Assignor 
an amount equal to the Purchased Percentage of such Fixed Rate Loan.  
On and after the Effective Date, the Assignee will also remit to the 
Assignor any amounts of interest on Loans [constituting part of any 
Ratable Advances] and fees received from the Agent which relate to the 
Purchased Percentage of Loans made by the Assignor accrued for periods 
prior to the Effective Date, in the case of Floating Rate Loans, or the 
Payment Date, in the case of Fixed Rate Loans, and not heretofore paid 
by the Assignee to the Assignor.  In the event interest for the period 
from the Effective Date to but not including the Payment Date is not 
paid by the Company with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan sold by the 
Assignor to the Assignee hereunder, the Assignee shall pay to the 
Assignor interest for such period on such Fixed Rate Loan at the 
applicable rate provided by the Credit Agreement.  In the event that 
either party hereto receives any payment to which the other party hereto 
is entitled under this Assignment Agreement, then the party receiving 
such amount shall promptly remit it to the other party hereto. 
 
    5.     FEES PAYABLE BY ASSIGNEE.  On each day on which the Assignee 
receives a payment of interest or commitment fees under the Credit 
Agreement (other than a payment of interest or commitment fees which 
the Assignee is obligated to deliver to the Assignor pursuant to Section 
4 hereof, which shall be excluded in determining fees payable to the 
Assignor pursuant to this Section), the Assignee shall pay to the 
Assignor a fee.  The amount of such fee shall be the difference between 
(i) the amount of such interest or fee, as applicable, received by the 
Assignee and (ii) the amount of the interest or fee, as applicable, which 
would have been received by the Assignee if each interest rate was 
 of 1% less than the interest rate paid by the Company or if the commitment 
fee was    of 1% less than the commitment fee paid by the Company, as 
applicable.  In addition, the Assignee agrees to pay    % of the fee 
required to be paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 13.3 of the Credit 
Agreement. 
 
     6.     CREDIT DETERMINATION; LIMITATIONS ON ASSIGNOR'S LIABILITY.

determinations and analysis based upon such information as the Assignee 
deemed sufficient to enter into the transaction contemplated hereby and 
not based on any statements or representations by the Assignor.  It is 
understood and agreed that the assignment and assumption hereunder are 
made without recourse to the Assignor and that the Assignor makes no 
representation or warranty of any kind to the Assignee and shall not be 
responsible for (i) the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, 
genuineness, sufficiency or collectibility of the Credit Agreement or any 
other Loan Document, including without limitation, documents granting the 
Assignor and the other Banks a security interest in assets of the Company 
or any guarantor, (ii) any representation, warranty or statement made in or 
in connection with any of the Loan Documents, (iii) the financial condition 
or creditworthiness of the Company or any guarantor, (iv) the performance 
of or compliance with any of the terms or provisions of any of the Loan 
Documents, (v) inspecting any of the property, books or records of the 
Company or (vi) the validity, enforceability, perfection, priority, 
condition, value or sufficiency of any collateral securing or purporting 
to secure the Loans.  Neither the Assignor nor any of its officers, 
directors, employees, agents or attorneys shall be liable for any mistake, 
error of judgment, or action taken or omitted to be taken in connection 
with the Loans or the Loan Documents, except for its or their own bad 
faith or willful misconduct. 
 
     7.     INDEMNITY. The Assignee agrees to indemnify and hold the 
Assignor harmless against any and all losses, costs and expenses 
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and 
liabilities incurred by the Assignor in connection with or arising 
in any manner from the Assignee's performance or non-performance of 
obligations assumed under this Assignment Agreement. 
 
    8.     SUBSEQUENT ASSIGNMENTS.  After the Effective Date, the 
Assignee shall have the right pursuant to Section 13.3 of the Credit 
Agreement to assign the rights which are assigned to the Assignee 
hereunder to any entity or person, provided that (i) any such subsequent 
assignment does not violate any of the terms and conditions of the Loan 
Documents or any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction 
or decree and that any consent required under the terms of the Loan 
Documents has been obtained, (ii) the assignee under such assignment 
from the Assignee shall agree to assume all of the Assignee's 
obligations hereunder in a manner satisfactory to the Assignor and 
(iii) the Assignee is not thereby released from any of its obligations 
to the Assignor hereunder. 
 
     9.     REDUCTIONS OF AGGREGATE COMMITMENT.  If any reduction in 
the Aggregate Commitment occurs between the date of this Assignment 
Agreement and the Effective Date, the percentage of the Aggregate 
Commitment assigned to the Assignee shall remain the percentage specified 
in Section 1 hereof and the dollar amount of the Commitment of the 
Assignee shall be recalculated based on the reduced Aggregate Commitment. 
 
     10.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Assignment Agreement and the attached 
consent embody the entire agreement and understanding between the parties 
hereto and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the 
parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof. 
 
     11.     GOVERNING LAW.  This Assignment Agreement shall be governed 
by the internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of 
California. 
 
     12.     NOTICES.  Notices shall be given under this Assignment 
Agreement in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement.  For the 
purpose hereof, the addresses of the parties hereto (until notice of a 
change is delivered) shall be the address set forth under each party's
