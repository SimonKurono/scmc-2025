         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 2000 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2001 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 3 - Net income per common share:
         ___________________________

     Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with
SFAS 128, "Earnings per Share."  This standard requires that basic earnings per
share be calculated using the average common shares outstanding.  Diluted
earnings per share are calculated by taking into consideration the dilutive
effect of issued and outstanding stock options.  Options to purchase 9.6
million and 1.6 million shares of common stock were outstanding at August 31,
2000 and August 31, 1999, respectively but were not included in the computation
of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the effect would
be antidilutive.  The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings
per share to diluted earnings per share:

                              Three Months Ended
                                 August 31,

NOTE 5 - Operating Segments:

     The Company's major operating segments are defined by geographic regions
for subsidiaries participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.  Other Brands as
shown below represent activity for Cole-Haan Holdings, Inc., Bauer NIKE Hockey,
Inc., and NIKE IHM, Inc. and are considered immaterial for individual
disclosure.  In prior years, the Company's operations in Africa were included
in the Americas region, but effective June 1, 2000, these operations are
included in the Europe region.  Africa information and certain other prior year
segment information has been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.  Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to
reconcile to the consolidated financial statements which generally include
corporate activity and corporate eliminations.  The segments are evidence of
the structure of the enterprise's internal organization.  Each NIKE Brand
geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:  the design,
production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and
equipment.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for each
segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial for
separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual operating
segments based on Contribution Profit before Corporate Allocations, Interest
Expense and Income Taxes.  On a consolidated basis, this amount represents
Income Before Taxes less Interest Expense as shown in the Consolidated Statement
of Income.  Other reconciling items for Contribution Profit represent corporate
costs that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting
and intercompany eliminations for specific income statement items.

     Accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets for operating segments
are regularly reviewed and therefore provided:

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION

Operating Results
_________________

     Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2001 was $210.2 million,
a 5% increase over the $200.2 million net income reported in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2000.  A 5% increase in revenues and a 190 basis point
improvement in gross margin percentage were the primary drivers of the
increase, offset in part by increased selling and administrative expenses.
Diluted earnings per share rose from $.70 to $.77, a 10% increase over the
prior year.  Share repurchases over the past year resulted in fewer shares
outstanding in fiscal year 2001, and hence drove earnings per share growth
faster than net income.

     Each geographic region achieved revenue growth in the quarter.   The U.S.
region, which represents 54% of NIKE brand revenues, grew 2%.  U.S. footwear
and apparel revenues declined 1% and 2%, respectively, while equipment
revenues grew 55%.

     Our international regions accounted for 46% of NIKE brand revenues in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2001, up from 44% in the first quarter of the
previous fiscal year.  Revenues in our European region, which includes
operations in Africa, grew 6%; had the value of the U.S. dollar remained
constant with the prior year, revenues would have increased 19%.  In the Asia
Pacific region, revenues grew 26%; had the value of the U.S. dollar remained
constant with the prior year, revenues would have increased 20%.  In the
Americas region, revenues grew 15%; had the value of the U.S. dollar remained
constant with the prior year, revenues would have increased 16%.  In the
international regions, the growth reflected higher revenues in footwear,
apparel and equipment.





The breakdown of revenues follows:

     The gross margin percentage for the quarter was 40.5%, representing the
third consecutive quarter in which that percentage was greater than 40%.  Each
region, and the footwear and apparel businesses, reported gross margin
percentage improvements over the prior year, resulting in a 190 basis point
improvement for the Company as a whole.  Several factors contributed to the
improved gross margin percentage from the previous year, including fewer
apparel close-outs, improved retail margins, and improved apparel net pricing
margins, driven primarily by a better product mix in Europe.

     Selling and administrative expenses increased $74.6 million versus the
first quarter of last year.  The largest factor in this increase was marketing
spending related to two major sporting events this fiscal year: the 2000
European Soccer Championship and the 2000 Summer Olympics.  Other significant
factors included our continued investments in new retail outlets, the
development of e-commerce, our supply chain initiatives and geographic
expansion.

     Interest expense for the quarter increased from $10.0 million last year
to $15.4 million this year, due to higher outstanding debt balances during the
first quarter of fiscal year 2001 versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2000.
The debt balances increased during fiscal year 2000 primarily to fund capital
expenditures, share repurchases and the financing of inventory purchases
previously financed by our trading partner, Nissho Iwai American Corporation
(NIAC), with whom we restructured our trading agreement in fiscal year 2000.

     Other income/expense was a net expense for the quarter of $20.0 million,
up from a $7.0 million expense in the prior year.  Foreign exchange losses
were the largest driver of this increased expense.

     Our effective tax rate decreased from 38.0% in the first quarter of the
prior year to 36.5% in the first quarter of this year.  The drop was primarily
due to increased utilization of tax loss carryforwards of certain foreign
operations that recently turned profitable and lower taxes on a portion of
foreign earnings that have been permanently reinvested offshore.


Futures Orders

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery between September 2000 and January 2001 totaled
$3.1 billion, essentially flat as compared to the same period last year.
These orders and the relative change in these orders between years are not
necessarily indicative of the change in revenues that we will experience for
subsequent periods.  This is due to potential shifts in the mix of advance
orders in relation to at-once orders and varying cancellation rates.  Exchange
rate fluctuations will also cause differences in the comparisons.


Euro Conversion

     On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the
European Union established permanent, fixed conversion rates between their
existing currencies and the European Union's new common currency, the euro.
During the transition period ending December 31, 2001, public and private
parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the
participating country's legacy currency. Beginning January 1, 2002, euro
denominated bills and coins will be issued, with the legacy currencies being
completely withdrawn from circulation on June 30, 2002.

     We have had a dedicated project team working on euro transition strategy
since January 1998. We are in the process of making modifications to
information echnology systems supporting marketing, order management,
purchasing, invoicing, payroll, and cash management functions. Many of our
systems are already euro compliant. Our plan is to have most systems converted
to euro compliance by the end of calendar year 2000, well ahead of the end of
the transitional period.

     We believe the introduction of the euro may create a move towards a
greater level of wholesale price harmonization, although differing country
costs and value added tax rates will continue to result in price differences
at the retail level. Over the past year, we have been actively working to
assess and, where necessary, adjust our pricing practices to operate
effectively in this new environment.  The introduction of the euro may also
reduce currency exchange and hedging costs.

     The costs of adapting our systems and practices to the implementation of
the euro are generally related to modification of existing systems, and are
estimated to be approximately $8 million. These costs are being expensed as
incurred. NIKE believes that the conversion to the euro will not have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Cash provided by operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001 was
$175.9 million, a decrease of $147.5 million versus the first quarter of last
year.  While net income increased $10.0 million over the prior year, cash
provided by operations was reduced by a $153.7 million increase in the use of
cash for working capital.  This change in working capital was due to a smaller
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the first quarter of
this year due to the timing of certain payments and the restructuring of our
agreement with NIAC in fiscal year 2000.

     Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2001 were $69.6
million.  A significant portion of this total expenditure was for computer
equipment and software, driven by our supply chain initiative.  We also
continued to invest funds in the expansion of our world headquarters and the
development of new warehouse facilities in Japan.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $27.6 million.  This
reflected increased short-term borrowings incurred primarily to fund higher
working capital balances than at May 31, 2000.

     We believe that the significant cash flow generated by operations,
together with access to external sources of funds, will be adequate to meet
our anticipated capital needs.  Significant short and long-term lines of
credit are maintained with banks, which, along with cash on hand, provide
adequate operating liquidity.  Liquidity is also provided by our commercial
paper program, under which there was $647.2 million outstanding at August 31,
2000.

     In the first quarter of fiscal year 2001, we purchased a total of 0.1
million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $5.9 million.  These
purchases were made under a four-year, $1 billion share repurchase program
authorized by our Board of Directors at the beginning the current fiscal year.
Funding for repurchases has, and is expected to continue to come primarily
from operating cash flow.  The timing and the amount of shares purchased will
be dictated by working capital needs and stock market conditions.

     Dividends per share of common stock for the first quarter of fiscal year
2001 remained at $.12 per share, the same level as the previous year.



Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There were no material changes to the disclosure made in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2000 regarding this matter.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference
from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other
reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("the Act").  Forward-
looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict,
forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and
may contain the words "believe, "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project,"
"will be," "will continue," "will result," or words or phrases of similar
meaning.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may
cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following:  international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers,
distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment for
consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences;
popularity of particular designs, categories of products, and sports; seasonal
and geographic demand for NIKE products; the size, timing and mix of purchases
of NIKE's products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating
results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders
may not be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and
at-once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth
and inventories; new product development and introduction; the ability to
secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property;
performance and reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity;
the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors;
business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet
delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general
risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including,
without limitation, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic
instability; changes in government regulations; liability and other claims
asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and
other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this
report may include additional factors which could adversely impact NIKE's
business and financial performance.  Moreover, NIKE operates in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from
time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk
factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual
results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information.  Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report.  Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.  Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
