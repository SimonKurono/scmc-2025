              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 2001 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2002 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 2 - Financial Risk Management and Derivatives:
         _________________________________________

Adoption of FAS 133

     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as
amended by SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities" (FAS 133) on June 1, 2001.

     In accordance with the transition provisions of FAS 133, the Company
recorded a one-time transition adjustment as of June 1, 2001 on both the
consolidated statement of income and the consolidated balance sheet. The
transition adjustment on the consolidated statement of income was a charge of
$5.0 million, net of tax effect. This amount related to an investment that was
adjusted to fair value in accordance with FAS 133. The transition adjustment
on the consolidated balance sheet represented the initial recognition of the
fair values of hedge derivatives outstanding on the adoption date and realized
gains and losses on effective hedges for which the underlying exposure had not
yet affected earnings. The transition adjustment on the consolidated balance
sheet was an increase in current assets of $116.4 million, an increase in
noncurrent assets of $87.0 million, an increase in current liabilities of
$151.6 million, and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately
$56.8 million, net of tax effect.  Of the $56.8 million recorded in other
comprehensive income as of June 1, 2001, the majority would be reclassified to
earnings during the next twelve months as a result of underlying hedged
transactions also being recorded in earnings.  Actual amounts ultimately
reclassified to earnings are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when
derivative contracts outstanding at the transition date mature.

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities

     The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is to
protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from
the sale and purchase of products in foreign currencies will be adversely
affected by changes in exchange rates. In addition, the Company seeks to
manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to the repayment of
intercompany transactions, including intercompany borrowings. The Company does
not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. It is the Company's policy
to utilize derivatives to reduce foreign exchange risks where internal netting
strategies cannot be effectively employed. Fluctuations in the value of
hedging instruments are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying
exposures being hedged.

     Derivatives used by the Company to hedge the risks described above are
forward exchange contracts, net purchased options and cross-currency swaps.
These instruments protect against the risk that the eventual net cash inflows
and outflows from foreign currency denominated transactions will be adversely
affected by changes in exchange rates. The cross-currency swaps are used to
hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan
agreements. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in European
currencies, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Korean won.
The Company hedges up to 100% of anticipated exposures as much as 24 months in
advance. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their
expected duration, which in some circumstances may be in excess of five years.

     All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets or other non-
current assets. Unrealized loss positions are recorded as accrued liabilities
or other non-current liabilities.

     Substantially all derivatives entered into by the Company qualify for and
are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges, including those hedging
foreign currency denominated firm commitments.

     The Company considers whether any provisions in non-derivative contracts
represent "embedded" derivative instruments as described in FAS 133. For the
period ended August 31, 2001 the Company has concluded that no "embedded"
derivative instruments warrant separate fair value accounting under FAS 133.

     Changes in fair values of outstanding derivatives that are highly
effective are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are
affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most
cases amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to
earnings after the maturity of the related derivative. The consolidated
statement of income classification of effective hedge results is the same as
that of the underlying exposure.

     The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges to either
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm
commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses,
both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be
expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined
that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge,
the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.

     The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it
determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as
firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the
forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that
designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.

     When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer
probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected
period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other
comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period
or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and
losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized
immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is
discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry
the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing future
changes in the fair value in current-period earnings.

     Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in current-period earnings. In the
quarter ended August 31, 2001 the Company recorded in other expense an
insignificant loss representing the total ineffectiveness of all derivatives.
Effectiveness is assessed based on forward rates.

     Premiums paid on net purchased options are initially recorded as deferred
charges.  The Company assesses effectiveness on net purchased options based on
the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options' fair
value to other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective.

     As of August 31, 2001, $5.7 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on
both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive
income are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve
months as a result of underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in
earnings. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings are dependent on
the exchange rates in effect when derivatives contracts that are currently
outstanding mature.  As of August 31, 2001, the maximum term over which the
Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for all
forecasted and recorded transactions is 27 months.

     The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-
performance by counterparties to hedging instruments and does not enter into
master netting arrangements. The counterparties to derivative transactions are
major financial institutions with high investment grade credit ratings and,
additionally, counterparties to derivatives three years or greater are AA or
better rated. However, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to
credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to
the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail
to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established
counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to
senior management according to prescribed guidelines. The Company utilizes a
portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the
same countries the Company conducts its business. As a result of the above
considerations, the Company considers the risk of counterparty default to be
minimal.

NOTE 4 - Earnings Per Common Share:
         _________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase 8.1 million and 9.6 million
shares of common stock were outstanding at August 31, 2001 and August 31,
2000, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
 earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than
 the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the effect would
 be antidilutive.

NOTE 6 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's major operating segments are defined by geographic regions
for subsidiaries participating in NIKE brand sales activity.  Other as shown
below represents activity for Cole-Haan Holdings, Inc., Bauer NIKE
Hockey, Inc., and NIKE IHM, Inc., which are considered immaterial for
individual disclosure.  Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items
necessary to reconcile to the consolidated financial statements, which
generally include corporate activity and corporate eliminations.  The segments
are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization.  Each
NIKE brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:  the
design, production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear,
apparel, and equipment.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on management pre-tax income.  On a consolidated
basis, this amount represents Income before income taxes and cumulative effect
of accounting change as shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Income.  Reconciling items for management pre-tax income represent corporate
costs that are not allocated to the operating segments for management
reporting and intercompany eliminations for specific income statement items.

     Accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets for operating segments
are regularly reviewed and therefore provided:

NOTE 7 - Commitments and Contingencies:
         _____________________________

     At August 31, 2001, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling $777.2 million.  These letters of credit were issued for the
purchase of inventory.

     There have been no other significant subsequent developments
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the
Company's most recent Form 10-K.


Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION

Operating Results
_________________

     Net income was $204.2 million (excluding an after-tax loss of $ 5.0
million related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change), a 2.9%
decrease from net income reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Pretax
income before accounting change declined 5.0%, driven by a 0.9% decrease in
revenues and a 1.1 point decrease in our gross margin percentage, partially
offset by a $14.5 million decrease in other expense. Net income declined at a
lower rate due to a 1.5 point reduction in our effective tax rate.

     The decrease in total company revenues reflected lower sales in the
United States and the effects of weaker foreign currencies on reported
international revenues.  NIKE brand revenues in the United States region
decreased 3.5% as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2001, while NIKE
brand revenues in our international regions increased 1.4%.  Had the U.S.
dollar remained constant with the prior year, these international revenues
would have increased 10.2% and consolidated revenues would have increased
3.0%. The decline in the U.S. region reflected a decrease in footwear revenues
of 7.0%, apparel revenues consistent with that of the prior year, and an
increase in equipment revenues of 22.0%.  The decline in footwear reflected
lower demand, particularly in the mid-range price segment, and to a lesser
extent, supply chain disruptions resulting from the implementation of a new
global demand and supply planning system.  The supply chain disruptions, which
began in the third quarter of fiscal 2001, caused late deliveries, which in
turn led to cancellations during the current quarter.

     Revenues from our international regions represented 45.3% of total
company revenues compared to 44.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.  In
the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, revenues reported in U.S.
dollars decreased 2.1%, but increased 6.4% in constant dollars.  In our Asia
Pacific region, reported revenues grew 9.6%, an increase of 22.6% in constant
dollars.  In our Americas region, reported revenues grew 6.7%, a 9.7% increase
in constant dollars.


The breakdown of revenues follows:

</TABLE>

     Our gross margin percentage declined 110 basis points, from 40.5% to
39.4%.  The primary drivers of the decrease were the effect of the weakening
of the euro against the U.S. dollar, relative to the first quarter of fiscal
year 2001 and lower margins in U.S. licensed team apparel.

     Selling and administrative expense fell 0.7% as compared to the first
quarter of fiscal 2001, driven by lower demand creation spending.  In the
first quarter of last year, we incurred significant expenses for marketing
related to the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2000 European Football
Championships.  Although we expect demand creation spending will increase for
the full fiscal year, the spending will be focused in the second half of the
year.  The lower demand creation spending in the current quarter was partially
offset by increased operational overhead, due in part to the cost of
additional retail stores this year and investments in our supply chain
initiative.

     Interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 dropped from $15.5
million to $13.0 million, a decline of 15.6%.  The decrease reflected lower
interest rates and lower average debt levels in the current year as we have
used operating free cash flow to reduce debt.

     Other expense was $5.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 versus
$20.0 million in fiscal 2001.  Significant amounts included in other expense
were interest income, profit sharing expense, goodwill amortization, and
certain foreign currency gains and losses.

     Our effective tax rate decreased as compared to the first quarter last
year, from 36.5% to 35.0%.  The drop was primarily due to lower taxes on a
portion of foreign earnings that have been permanently reinvested offshore.

Futures Orders

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery from September 2001 through January 2002 were
6% higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of fiscal 2001. The
percentage growth in these orders is not necessarily indicative of our
expectation of revenue growth in subsequent periods. This is because the mix
of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition,
exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations
can cause differences in the comparisons between future orders and actual
revenues. Finally, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from
futures orders, including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team
apparel, Bauer NIKE Hockey, and Cole Haan, and retail sales across all
brands.

     The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent world events
have created a significant amount of uncertainty about the future prospects
for the U.S. and world economies.  The overall effect on the demand for NIKE
products is also uncertain.  As might be expected, sales in Nike-owned retail
stores declined significantly in the days immediately following the attacks,
although in subsequent weeks this business has recovered somewhat from these
very depressed levels.  Requests for order cancellations have also increased.
It is still unclear what negative effect all of these events will have on our
business for the full year.  In the face of this uncertainty, we are
developing contingency plans, focused particularly on inventory and cost
management with the goal of reducing the potential impact on earnings.  We
continue to expect earnings growth for the full fiscal year.

Euro Conversion

     On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the
European Union established permanent, fixed conversion rates between their
existing currencies and the European Union's new common currency, the euro. In
January 2001, an additional country, Greece, also established a fixed
conversion rate to the euro. During the transition period ending December 31,
2001, public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either
the euro or the participating country's legacy currency. Beginning January 1,
2002, euro denominated bills and coins will be issued, and the legacy
currencies will be completely withdrawn from circulation on June 30, 2002.

     We have had a dedicated project team working on the euro transition
strategy since January 1998. We have made modifications to information
technology systems supporting marketing, order management, purchasing,
invoicing, payroll, and cash management functions, in order to make them euro
compliant. All major systems have been converted and are euro compliant, well
ahead of the end of the transitional period.

     We believe the introduction of the euro may create a move towards a
greater level of wholesale price harmonization, although differing country
costs and value added tax rates will continue to result in price differences at
the retail level. Over the past three years, we have been actively working to
assess and, where necessary, adjust pricing practices to operate effectively in
this new environment.

     The costs of adapting our systems and practices to the implementation of
the euro were generally related to the modification of existing systems and
totaled approximately $8 million. These costs were expensed as incurred,
primarily in fiscal 2000. We believe that the conversion to the euro will not
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standard

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" (FAS 142).  Our adoption date will be June 1, 2002. As required by FAS
142, we will perform an impairment test on goodwill and other intangible
assets as of the adoption date. Thereafter, we will perform impairment tests
annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of
goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired. Amortization of
goodwill and certain other intangible assets, including those recorded in past
business combinations, will cease.  As a result of the elimination of this
amortization, other expense will decrease by approximately $13 million
annually.  We have not yet determined the impact of FAS 142's impairment test
provisions on our results of operations and financial position.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Cash provided by operations was $235.4 million in the first three months
of fiscal 2002, compared to $175.9 million in the first three months of fiscal
2001.  Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $199.2
million.  Cash provided by operations increased as compared to last year as
smaller increases in working capital used less cash.  The increase in working
capital during the first quarter of last year was due to the timing of certain
payments and the restructuring of our agreement with NIAC in fiscal 2000.

     Total cash used by investing activities during the first quarter of fiscal
2002 was $51.8 million, compared to $63.4 million invested during fiscal 2001.
The decrease reflected lower capital spending on our campus expansion, which
has been completed, and on our new distribution facilities in Japan, which
began operating in April 2002.  The most significant capital expenditures
during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 were related to computer equipment and
software, driven by our supply chain initiative.

     Net cash used by financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2002
was $90.1 million, versus cash provided by financing activities of $27.6
million in the first quarter of the prior year.  The biggest use of cash in
the current quarter was repayment of debt with available free cash flows.
Additional uses included the payment of dividends to shareholders and the
repurchase of common shares.

     The share repurchases were part of a $1 billion share repurchase program
that began in fiscal 2001.  In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we
purchased approximately 400,000 shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for
$20.0 million.  We expect to fund the current program from operating free cash
flow. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our
capital needs and stock market conditions.

     In August 2001, we issued a $250 million corporate bond, maturing in
August 2006, with an interest rate of 5.5%.  With the proceeds, we reduced the
amount of commercial paper outstanding.

     On October 10, 2001, we filed a debt registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for $1 billion.  The Company had $250
million remaining under our shelf registration statement filed in April 1999,
which was incorporated into the new $1 billion registration.  We have not
issued any debt under the new registration statement.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds, will be sufficient to meet our operating
and capital needs.  Significant short and long-term lines of credit are
maintained with banks, which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate
operating liquidity.  Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper
program, under which there was $449.6 million and $710.0 million outstanding
at August 31, 2001 and May 31, 2001, respectively.

     At August 31, 2001, letters of credit of $777.2 million were outstanding
for the purchase of inventories.

     Dividends per share of common stock for the first quarter of fiscal 2002
remained at $.12 per share, the same level as the previous year.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There were no material changes to the disclosure made in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2001 regarding this
matter.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and
at-once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth
and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
 to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

                          COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE
                       AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

PARTIES:

          Thomas E. Clarke (EMPLOYEE)

          NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation, and its divisions,
          subsidiaries and affiliates (NIKE)

DATE: August 31, 1994

RECITALS:

          A.     This Covenant Not to Compete is executed upon the
EMPLOYEE's advancement to the position of President and nomination to
the Board of Directors of NIKE.

          B.     Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE,
EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or in a position to
generate confidential information including but not limited to
confidential techniques, methods, styles, designs and design concepts,
developments, customer lists, vendor lists, contract factory lists,
pricing information, manufacturing plans, business plans, marketing
plans, sales information, methods of operation, knowledge and data
relating to processes, products, machines, compounds and compositions,
formulae, lasts and molds.  It is anticipated that EMPLOYEE will
continue to be exposed to confidential information, will be exposed to
more confidential information and to confidential information of
greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE advances in the company.  This
confidential information is information peculiar to NIKE's business.
The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive and disclosure of
any confidential information would result in severe damage to NIKE and
be difficult to measure.

          C.     NIKE makes use of the confidential information
described in paragraph B above throughout the world.  This confidential
information of NIKE can be used to NIKE's detriment anywhere in the
world.

          D.     The provisions of this Covenant Not to Compete and
Non-Disclosure Agreement are a condition of EMPLOYEE's employment
advancement with NIKE.

          E.     The provisions of this Covenant Not to Compete and
Non-Disclosure Agreement are reasonable.

AGREEMENTS:

          1.     COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.     During the period of time
EMPLOYEE is employed by NIKE, under the terms of any employment
contract or otherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE will
not directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control, or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or
be employed by or connected in any manner with, any business engaged
anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear business, athletic
apparel business, or any other business which directly competes with
NIKE or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated corporations.  This
provision is (a) subject to NIKE's option to waive all or any portion
of the one (1) year time period of non-competition following
termination more specifically provided for in paragraph 2; and (b)
subject to NIKE's option to specifically identify, at the time of
termination, those businesses which EMPLOYEE may not be employed by or
connected with for the period of non-competition.  NIKE agrees to act
in good faith in its exercise of the above-noted options.

          2.     ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION.

                 a.     As additional consideration for the covenant
not to compete described in paragraph 1 above, it is agreed that:

                          (i)     If EMPLOYEE voluntarily leaves the
employ of NIKE, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to one-
half (1/2) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly salary for the one (1) year
period after termination of employment, payable on the first day of
each month, or

                          (ii)     If EMPLOYEE is involuntarily
terminated, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to
EMPLOYEE's last monthly salary for the one (1) year period after
termination of employment, payable on the first day of each month.

                 b.     NIKE has the option, for whatever reason, to
elect to waive all or a portion of the one (1) year period of non-
competition following termination, by giving EMPLOYEE written notice of
such election not less than 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective
date of the waiver.  In that event, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay
EMPLOYEE under this paragraph for any months as to which the covenant
not to compete has been waived.

          3.     LESSER RESTRICTIONS.     Should any of the terms of
paragraphs 1 and 2 above be found unreasonable or invalid by any court
of competent jurisdiction, the parties agree to accept as binding, in
lieu thereof, the maximum terms enforceable by law.

          4.     EXTENSION OF TIME.     The covenant not to compete
described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above shall be extended by a time
period equal to any time consumed in enforcement of the obligations
hereunder during which EMPLOYEE engaged in activities violating the
covenant not to compete.

          5.     NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.     During the period of
employment by NIKE and forever thereafter, EMPLOYEE will hold in
confidence all information of a confidential nature, including but not
limited to the information described in Recital "B", (all of which
information of a confidential nature shall hereinafter be referred to
as "confidential information") and will not, at any time, directly or
indirectly, use any confidential information for any purpose outside
the scope of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE or disclose any
confidential information to any person or organization without the
prior written consent of NIKE.  Specifically, but not by way of
limitation, EMPLOYEE shall not ever copy, transmit, reproduce,
summarize, quote, publish or make any commercial or other use
whatsoever of any confidential information without the prior written
consent of NIKE.

          6.     RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.     Upon
termination and upon written request by NIKE at any time, EMPLOYEE
shall return to NIKE all documents, records, notebooks and other
similar repositories of or containing confidential information,
including all copies thereof, then in EMPLOYEE's possession, whether
prepared by EMPLOYEE or others, and deliver to NIKE any and all other
confidential information, in whatever form, that may be in EMPLOYEE's
possession or under EMPLOYEE's control.

          7.     UNAUTHORIZED USE.     During the period of employment
with NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE shall notify NIKE immediately of the
unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any confidential
information by any person employed or not employed by NIKE at the time
of such possession, use or knowledge.  EMPLOYEE shall promptly furnish
details of such possession, use or knowledge to NIKE, will assist in
preventing the reoccurrence of such possession, use or knowledge, and
shall cooperate with NIKE in any litigation against third parties
deemed necessary by NIKE to protect the confidential information.
EMPLOYEE's compliance with this paragraph shall not be construed in any
way as a waiver of any of NIKE's rights or remedies against EMPLOYEE
arising out of or related to such unauthorized possession, use or
knowledge.

          8.     INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.     The remedy at law for any
breach of this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement
will be inadequate.  It is reasonable to require that EMPLOYEE not
compete with NIKE in order to protect NIKE from unfair use of the
confidential information.  NIKE shall be entitled to injunctive relief
in addition to any other remedy it may have.  A breach of this Covenant
Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement during the period of
EMPLOYEE'S employment with NIKE shall be considered a breach of the
terms of that employment and NIKE shall have the right to terminate
EMPLOYEE's employment in addition to any other rights or remedies NIKE
may have.

          9.     WAIVER, AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION OR CANCELLATION.    No
waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term or
condition of this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement
shall be effective unless executed in writing by the party charged
therewith.  No written waiver shall excuse the performance of any act
other than the act or acts specifically referred to therein.

          10.    APPLICABLE LAW/JURISDICTION/VENUE.     This Covenant
Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment
hereunder, shall be construed according to the laws of the state of
Oregon and EMPLOYEE hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of
the state of Oregon and waives application of any foreign law relating
to this Agreement and EMPLOYEE's employment by NIKE.  Any suit or
action of any kind relating to this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof shall be brought in a court located in Washington County,
Oregon.

          Mark G. Parker (EMPLOYEE)

          NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation, and its divisions,
          subsidiaries and affiliates (NIKE)

DATE: October 6, 1994

RECITALS:

          A.     This Covenant Not to Compete is executed upon the
EMPLOYEE's assumption of additional responsibilities for worldwide
marketing and development activities of NIKE.

          B.     Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE,
EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or in a position to
generate confidential information including but not limited to
confidential techniques, methods, styles, designs and design concepts,
developments, customer lists, vendor lists, contract factory lists,
pricing information, manufacturing plans, business plans, marketing
plans, sales information, methods of operation, knowledge and data
relating to processes, products, machines, compounds and compositions,

continue to be exposed to confidential information, will be exposed to
more confidential information and to confidential information of
greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE advances in the company.  This
confidential information is information peculiar to NIKE's business.
The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive and disclosure of
any confidential information would result in severe damage to NIKE and
be difficult to measure.

          C.     NIKE makes use of the confidential information
described in paragraph B above throughout the world.  This confidential
information of NIKE can be used to NIKE's detriment anywhere in the
world.

          D.     The provisions of this Covenant Not to Compete and
Non-Disclosure Agreement are a condition of EMPLOYEE's employment
advancement with NIKE.

          E.     The provisions of this Covenant Not to Compete and
Non-Disclosure Agreement are reasonable.


AGREEMENTS:

          1.     COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.  During the period of time
EMPLOYEE is employed by NIKE, under the terms of any employment
contract or otherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE will
not directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control, or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or
be employed by or connected in any manner with, any business engaged
anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear business, athletic
apparel business, or any other business which directly competes with
NIKE or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated corporations.  This
provision is (a) subject to NIKE's option to waive, but only with the
concurrence of the EMPLOYEE, all or any portion of the one (1) year
time period of non-competition following termination more specifically
provided for in paragraph 2; and (b) subject to NIKE's option to
specifically identify, at the time of termination, those businesses
which EMPLOYEE may not be employed by or connected with for the period
of non-competition.  NIKE agrees to act in good faith in its exercise
of the above-noted options.

          2.     ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION.

                 a.     As additional consideration for the covenant
not to compete described in paragraph 1 above, it is agreed that:

                           (i)     If EMPLOYEE voluntarily leaves the
employ of NIKE at any time during the term hereof, NIKE shall pay
EMPLOYEE an amount per month equal to one-twenty-fourth (1/24) of
EMPLOYEE's then current "Annual NIKE Income" (defined herein to mean
base salary and bonuses received by EMPLOYEE during the twelve (12)
month period immediately preceding termination), or $20,833.34 per
month, whichever is greater, for the one (1) year period of non-
competition following voluntary termination of employment, payable on
the first day of each month, or

                           (ii)    If EMPLOYEE is involuntarily
terminated by NIKE at any time during the term hereof, either with or
without cause, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE an amount per month equal to
one-twelfth (1/12) of EMPLOYEE's then current Annual NIKE Income, or
$41,666.67 per month, whichever is greater, for the one (1) year period
of non-competition following involuntary termination of employment,
payable on the first day of each month.

                  b.     NIKE may waive all or any portion of the one
(1) year period of non-competition following termination, subject to
the following provisions:

                           (i)     At any time during, or prior to the
commencement of, the one (1) year period, NIKE may tender to EMPLOYEE
thirty (30) days written notice of its desire to waive all or the then
remaining portion of the one (1) year period of non-competition.
Within the thirty (30) day notice period, EMPLOYEE will have the option
of accepting or rejecting NIKE's tender by advising NIKE in writing of
EMPLOYEE's election to accept the waiver, in which event EMPLOYEE would
be free to compete at the end of the thirty (30) day notice period and
all payments to EMPLOYEE hereunder would cease, or to reject the
waiver, in which event EMPLOYEE would continue to be prohibited from
competing for the remaining portion of the one (1) year period of non-
competition and payments to EMPLOYEE would continue as herein provided.

                           (ii)    However, notwithstanding anything
contained in subparagraph 2(b)(i) above, if EMPLOYEE is terminated by
NIKE "for cause" (defined herein to include only continual and repeated
neglect of duties and dishonesty) NIKE shall have the unqualified right
to waive, without EMPLOYEE's consent, all or any portion of the one (1)
year period of non-competition following termination, by giving
EMPLOYEE written notice of such election not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date of the waiver.   In that event, NIKE shall
not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE hereunder for any months as to which
the covenant not to compete has been waived.

          3.     LESSER RESTRICTIONS.     Should any of the terms of
paragraphs 1 and 2 above be found unreasonable or invalid by any court
of competent jurisdiction, the parties agree to accept as binding, in
lieu thereof, the maximum terms enforceable by law.

          4.     EXTENSION OF TIME.     The covenant not to compete
described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above shall be extended by a time
period equal to any time consumed in enforcement of the obligations
hereunder during which EMPLOYEE engaged in activities violating the
covenant not to compete.

          5.     NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.    During the period of
employment by NIKE and forever thereafter,  EMPLOYEE will hold in
confidence all information of a confidential nature, including but not
limited to the information described in Recital "B", (all of which
information of a confidential nature shall hereinafter be referred to

indirectly, use any confidential information for any purpose outside

prior written consent of NIKE.  Specifically, but not by way of

whatsoever of any confidential information without the prior written
consent of NIKE.

termination and upon written request by NIKE at any time, EMPLOYEE
shall return to NIKE all documents, records, notebooks and other
similar repositories of or containing confidential information,
including all copies thereof, then in EMPLOYEE's possession, whether

with NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE shall notify NIKE immediately of the
unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any confidential
information by any person employed or not employed by NIKE at the time
of such possession, use or knowledge.  EMPLOYEE shall promptly furnish

preventing the reoccurrence of such possession, use or knowledge, and
shall cooperate with NIKE in any litigation against third parties

EMPLOYEE's compliance with this paragraph shall not be construed in any

arising out of or related to such unauthorized possession, use or

Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement during the period of

waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term or
condition of this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement
shall be effective unless executed in writing by the party charged

hereunder, shall be construed according to the laws of the state of

                               NIKE, INC.
                        DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
        (as Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2000)

     This Plan is amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2000 by
NIKE, Inc. (the "Company"), acting on behalf of itself and its designated
subsidiaries.  Throughout, the term "Company" shall include wherever
relevant any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the
Company or any entity in which the Company has a significant equity or
investment interest, as determined by the Company.
                                 RECITALS
     1.   The Company adopted the Supplemental Executive Savings Plan
effective February 1, 1994 (the "SESP").  The SESP was adopted to provide
an opportunity for eligible employees to set aside additional amounts for
retirement on a tax deferred basis and to provide a limited make-up of
profit sharing contributions lost as a result of the limit on
compensation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the "Code") under the Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing
Plan for employees of NIKE, Inc. (the "Profit Sharing Plan").  The SESP
is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of a select
group of management or highly-compensated employees of the Company.
     2.   The Company adopted the Supplemental Executive Profit Sharing
Plan effective as of June 1, 1995 (the "SEPSP") to expand the make-up of
profit sharing contributions lost under the Profit Sharing Plan and to
separate the restoration provisions from the elective deferral provisions
of the SESP.
     3.   Effective as of January 1, 1998, the Company combined the SEPSP
and the SESP and made certain other changes.  The resulting plan was
renamed the NIKE, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The
Company now wishes to again amend and restate the Plan, effective as of
January 1, 2000.
     4.   Under the Plan, the Company is obligated to pay vested accrued
benefits to Plan Participants and their Beneficiary or Beneficiaries from
the Company's general assets.
     5.   In connection with the Plan, the Company is party to an
agreement (the "Trust Agreement") with Northern Trust Company as trustee
(the "Trustee") under an irrevocable trust (the "Trust").
     6.   The Company intends to make contributions to the Trust so that
such contributions will be held by the Trustee and invested, reinvested
and distributed, all in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and
the Trust Agreement.
     7.   The Company intends that amounts contributed to the Trust and
the earnings thereon shall be used by the Trustee if necessary to satisfy
the liabilities of the Company under the Plan with respect to each Plan
participant for whom an Account has been established and such utilization
shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.
     8.   The Company intends that the Trust be a "grantor trust" with
the principal and income of the Trust treated as assets and income of the
Company for federal and state income tax purposes.
     9.   The Company intends that the assets of the Trust shall at all
times be subject to the claims of the general creditors of the Company as
provided in the Trust Agreement.
    10.   The Company intends that the existence of the Trust shall not
alter the characterization of the Plan as "unfunded" for purposes of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
and shall not be construed to provide income to Plan participants under
the Plan prior to actual payment of the vested accrued benefits
thereunder.
     NOW THEREFORE, the Company does hereby adopt this amended and
restated Plan as follows and does also hereby agree that the Plan shall
be structured, held and disposed of as follows:

Participant in the Plan by electing to defer a portion of his or her
Compensation in accordance with Section 3.1.


                                ARTICLE III

                           DEFERRAL ELECTIONS

    3.1   Elections to Defer Compensation


          (a)   Initial Election Period.  Each Eligible Employee,
Director or Consultant may elect to defer Compensation by filing an
election with the Committee that conforms to the requirements of this
Section 3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no later than the last
day of his or her Initial Election Period.  Deferral Elections filed with
respect to the 1998 Plan Year shall supersede any and all prior deferral
elections made in connection with the Predecessor Plans.

          (b)   General Rule.  The amount of Compensation that an
Eligible Employee, Director or Consultant may elect to defer is as
follows:

                (1)   Any whole percentage of Salary up to 100%;

                (2)   Any whole percentage of Bonus up to 100%;

                (3)   Any whole percentage of Commissions up to 100%;
                (4)   Any whole percentage of Fees up to 100%;
provided, however, that no election shall be effective to reduce the
Compensation paid to an Eligible Employee to an amount that is less than
the amount necessary to pay applicable employment taxes (e.g., FICA,
hospital insurance) payable with respect to amounts deferred hereunder,
amounts necessary to satisfy any other benefit plan withholding
obligations, any resulting income taxes payable with respect to
Compensation that cannot be so deferred, and any amounts necessary to
satisfy any wage garnishment or similar type obligations.

          (c)   Minimum Deferrals.  For each full Plan Year during which
the Eligible Employee is a Participant, the minimum dollar amount that
may be deferred under this Section 3.1 is $5,000 ($1,000 in the case of
Directors and Consultants).

          (d)   Effect of Initial Election.  An election to defer Salary,
Commissions or Fees made during an Initial Election Period shall be
effective as to Salary and Commissions earned beginning with the first
pay period beginning after the Initial Election Period.  Employees who
first became Eligible Employees during a Plan Year may make an election
to defer Bonuses payable in subsequent Plan Years by making deferral
elections in accordance with subsections 3.1(e) and (f).

          (e) Duration of Deferral Election.  A Compensation deferral
election made under paragraph (a) or paragraph (f) of this Section 3.1
shall remain in effect, notwithstanding any change in the Participant's
Compensation until modified or terminated as provided herein.  A
Participant may irrevocably elect at any time to reduce the percentage to
be deferred from Salary or Fees earned in the remainder of the Plan Year
to zero.  Subject to the minimum deferral requirement of subsection (c)
of this Section, the percentage of Salary, Commissions and Fees
designated by the Participant for deferral may be modified by filing a
new election, in accordance with the terms of this Section, with the
Committee not later than December 15 of the year immediately preceding
the beginning of the Plan Year for which the election shall be in effect.
A Participant's deferral election shall terminate with respect to future
Compensation upon the Participant ceasing to be an Eligible Employee,
Director or Consultant.

          (f)  Elections Other Than Elections During the Initial Election
Period.  Any Eligible Employee, Director or Consultant who fails to elect
to defer Compensation during his or her Initial Election Period may
subsequently become a Participant by filing an election, on a form
provided by the Committee, to defer Compensation as described in
paragraph (b) above.  An election to defer Compensation must be filed no
later than December 15 (or such earlier date as the Committee may
establish) and will be effective for Salary, Commissions and Fees earned
beginning with the first pay period beginning on and after the beginning
of the next succeeding Plan Year and any Bonus payable in the next
succeeding Plan Year.

          (g)  Director's 1999 Transition Election.  Any Director as of
September 1, 1999, shall have made an election on or before September 24,
1999, to either remain eligible for the Director's Retirement Annuity or
elect to convert such annuity to the Director's 1999 Transition
Retirement Benefit, in either case such benefit not payable until the
Director's Retirement.  In the event an electing Director converted the
Director's Retirement Annuity, such election shall be irrevocable and
paid as provided herein.

    3.2   Company Contributions


          (a)  Eligibility. An Eligible Employee who qualifies for a
contribution for a Plan Year under the Profit Sharing Plan shall be
eligible for a Company contribution under this Plan for such Plan Year if
they either (i) make a Deferral Election under 3.1 for the Plan Year, or
(ii) receive compensation under the Profit Sharing Plan exceeding the
Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit of $150,000 (as indexed)

Sharing Plan Year (ending with or within the Plan Year) would be higher
if calculated on the basis of Compensation as defined under this Plan and
determined (i) before any reduction for deferral of compensation under
this Plan, and (ii) without regard to the Internal Revenue Code Section
401(a)(17) limit).".

          (c)  Discretionary Company Contributions.  In addition to
Company contributions in accordance with Section 3.2(b), the Company may,
in its sole discretion, make discretionary contributions to the Accounts
of one or more Participants at such times and in such amounts as the
Board or the Committee may determine.

          (d)  Director's Retirement Contribution.  In addition to any
Company contributions made in accordance with 3.2 (a)-(c), the Company
shall credit to the Accounts of any electing Director the number of
shares of Company Stock equivalent to the electing Director's 1999
Transition Retirement Benefit.  The Company may contribute such shares
corresponding to the total of all electing Director's benefits, at such
time and in such amount as the Board or the Committee may determine,
provided that any shares so contributed shall remain in the name of the
Company (or any trust established by the Company for this purpose), and
shall be its sole property in which no electing Director shall have any
interest.

    3.3   Investment Elections.


          (a)  Hypothetical Investment Funds.  The Committee may, in its
discretion, provide each Participant with a list of investment Funds
available for hypothetical investment, and the Participant may designate,
in a manner specified by the Committee, one or more Funds that his or her
Account will be deemed to be invested in for purposes of determining the
amount of earnings to be credited to that Account.  The Committee may,
from time to time, in its sole discretion select a commercially available
fund to constitute the Fund actually selected.  The Investment Return of
each such commercially available fund shall be used to determine the
amount of earnings to be credited to Participants' Accounts under Section
4.1(d).

               (1) Deemed Investment Elections. In making the designation
pursuant to this Section 3.3, the Participant may specify that all or any
1% multiple of his or her Account be deemed to be invested in one or more
of the Funds offered by the Committee.  Subject to such limitations and
conditions as the Committee may specify, a Participant may change the
designation made under this Section 3.3 in such manner and at such time
or times as the Committee shall specify.  If a Participants fails to
elect a Fund under this Section 3.3, or if the Committee shall not
provide Participants with a list of Funds pursuant to this Section 3.3,
the Participant shall be deemed to have elected a money market fund.

               (2) No Company Obligation.  The Company may, but need not,
acquire investments corresponding to those designated by the Participants
hereunder, and it is not under any obligation to maintain any investment
it may make.  Any such investments, if made, shall be in the name of the
Company, and shall be its sole property in which no Participant shall
have any interest.

        (b)   Director's Plan Investments. In addition to any hypothetical
investment Fund elections the Director may make with respect to amounts
deferred under 3.1, the following shall apply to a Director's Plan Account:

              (1) 1999 Transition Retirement Plan Subaccount.  The entirety
of an electing Director's 1999 Transition Retirement Benefit shall be
maintained in a separate subaccount, reflecting the number of shares of
Company Stock in which the electing Director is vested and entitled to
under the Plan as his or her 1999 Transition Retirement Benefit.  The
balance in such subaccount shall be expressed in units (denominated in
shares of Company Stock).  The number of units reflected in an electing
Director's 1999 Transition Retirement Benefit subaccount shall be
appropriately adjusted periodically to reflect any dividend, split, split-
up or any combination or exchange, however, accomplished, with respect to
the shares of Company Stock represented by such units.


                              ARTICLE IV

    4.1   Participant Accounts.


          The Committee shall establish and maintain an Account for each
Participant under the Plan.  Each Participant's Account may be further
divided into separate subaccounts ("investment fund subaccounts"),
corresponding to investment Funds elected by the Participant pursuant to
Section 3.3 or as otherwise determined by the Committee to be necessary
or appropriate for proper Plan administration.  A Participant's Account
shall be credited as follows:

          (a)  As soon as practicable following the end of each
applicable pay period, the Committee shall credit the investment fund
subaccounts of the Participant's Account with an amount equal to Salary,
Commissions or Fees deferred by the Participant during each pay period in
accordance with the Participant's election; that is, the portion of the
Participant's deferred Salary, Commissions or Fees that the Participant
has elected to be deemed to be invested in a certain type of investment
Fund shall be credited to the investment fund subaccount corresponding to
that investment Fund.

          (b)  As soon as practicable after each Bonus or partial Bonus
would have been paid, the Committee shall credit the investment fund
subaccounts of the Participant's Account with an amount equal to the
portion of the Bonus deferred by the Participant's election; that is, the
portion of the Participant's deferred Bonus that the Participant has
elected to be deemed to be invested in a certain type of investment Fund
shall be credited to the investment fund subaccount corresponding to that
investment Fund.

          (c)  As soon as practicable after the last day of the Plan Year
or such earlier time or times as the Committee may determine, the
Committee shall credit the investment fund subaccounts of the
Participant's Account with an amount equal to the portion, if any, of any
Company contribution made to or for the Participant's benefit in
accordance with Section 3.2; that is, the portion of the Participant's
Company contribution, if any, that the Participant has elected to be
deemed to be invested in a certain type of investment Fund shall be
credited to the investment fund subaccount corresponding to that
investment Fund.

          (d)  At such time or times as the Committee may determine, but
not less frequently than monthly, each investment fund subaccount of a
Participant's Account shall be credited with earnings in an amount equal
to that determined by multiplying the balance credited to such investment
fund subaccount as of the last day of the preceding valuation period by
the Investment Return for the corresponding Fund selected by the Company.

    7.1   Distribution of Deferred Compensation:  Termination of Service

          (a) Retirement; Disability; Death.  In the event a
Participant's Service terminates as a result of Retirement, long-term
disability (as defined in the Company's long-term disability plan for
employees) or death, and provided further that such Participant does not
return to Service prior to the Payment Commencement Date, the
Participant's Distributable Amount shall be paid to the Participant (and
after his or her death to his or her Beneficiary) in substantially equal
quarterly installments over 15 years beginning on his or her Payment
Commencement Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, in
lieu of quarterly installments over 15 years, elect a cash lump sum
payment or quarterly installments over five or 10 years by filing an
election with the Committee within 30 days of the date he or she first
becomes a Participant.

          A Participant may change his or her form of distribution under
this subsection 7.1(a) provided that his or her change is filed with the
Committee at least one year prior to his or her Payment Commencement
Date; otherwise, the most recent distribution election made by the
Participant one (1) or more years prior to the Payment Commencement Date
shall govern.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant's
Distributable Amount is $25,000 or less, the Distributable Amount shall
automatically be distributed in the form of a cash lump sum on the
Participant's Payment Commencement Date.  If the Participant's
Distributable Amount is paid in installments, the Participant's Account
shall continue to be credited monthly with earnings pursuant to Section
4.1(d) of the Plan and the installment amount shall be adjusted annually
to reflect gains and losses until all amounts credited to his or her
Account under the Plan have been distributed.

          Amounts payable pursuant to this subsection 7.1(a) shall be
subject to the limitation on payout under Section 7.5.

          (b)   Other Termination.  In the case of a Participant whose
Service with the Company terminates for any reason other then Retirement,
long-term disability of death, the Participant's Distributable Amount
shall be paid to the Participant in the form of a cash lump sum on the
Participant's Payment Commencement Date, provided that no such
distribution shall occur in the event the Participant returns to Service
prior to the Payment Commencement Date.

          (c)   Death While Receiving Benefits.  If the Participant is in
pay status at the time of death, the Beneficiary shall be paid the

(a)   Scheduled Withdrawals.  A Participant may, in connection
with his or her Compensation deferral election for a Plan Year, specify a
withdrawal (a "Scheduled Withdrawal") of all of his or her Account
attributable to Compensation deferred for such Plan Year, including any
amounts credited with respect to such deferrals pursuant to Section
4.1(d), subject to the following restrictions:

                (1)  A Participant's Scheduled Withdrawal election must

                (3)  The amount payable to a Participant in connection
with a Scheduled Withdrawal shall in all cases be 100% of the
Compensation deferred for the Plan Year with respect to which the
election applies, together with any earnings credited to such amount
pursuant to Section 4.1(d), determined as of the end of the calendar
month as of or preceding the month of the Scheduled Withdrawal date,
provided that no portion of the of the Participant's Account attributable
to Company contributions pursuant to Section 3.2, if any, shall be
eligible for Scheduled Withdrawal.

                (4)  A Participant may, at least one year prior to a
Scheduled Withdrawal date, revoke his or her Scheduled Withdrawal
election in favor of a later Scheduled Withdrawal date that is at least
one year later, provided that a Participant may not postpone a Scheduled
Withdrawal more than twice.

                (5)  Subject to Section 7.5, payment of a Scheduled
Withdrawal shall be made in a single lump sum as soon as practicable
after the Scheduled Withdrawal date.

                 (6)  A Participant's Scheduled Withdrawal election shall
become void and of no effect upon termination of the Participant's
employment with the Company for any reason before the Participant's
scheduled withdrawal date.  In such event, the distribution provisions of
Section 7.1 shall apply.

          (b)   Unscheduled Withdrawals.  Participants may request to
withdraw amounts from their Accounts attributable to Compensation
deferrals prior to termination of Service (an "Unscheduled Withdrawal").
Upon receiving an Unscheduled Withdrawal request, the Committee shall
determine, in its discretion as applied in a uniform and
nondiscriminating manner, whether to permit any such Unscheduled
Withdrawal and the amount, if any, to be withdrawn, subject to the
following restrictions:

                (1)  The election to take an Unscheduled Withdrawal shall
be made by filing a form provided by and filed with the Committee.

                (2)  The amount payable to a Participant in connection
with an Unscheduled Withdrawal shall in all cases equal 90% of the amount
requested by the Participant or, if lesser, 90% of the Unscheduled
Withdrawal amount approved by the Committee; provided, however, that the
maximum amount payable to a Participant in connection with an Unscheduled
Withdrawal shall be 90% of the Distributable Amount as of the end of the
calendar month in which the Unscheduled Withdrawal election is made, and
provided further, that no portion of the amount attributable to Company
contributions pursuant to Section 3.2, if any, shall be eligible for an
Unscheduled Withdrawal.

                (3)  If a Participant receives an Unscheduled Withdrawal,
the remaining portion of the requested or approved amount, as applicable
(i.e., 10% of such amount), shall be permanently forfeited and the
Company shall have no obligation to the Participant or his Beneficiary
with respects to such forfeited amount.

                (4)  If a Participant receives an Unscheduled Withdrawal,
the Participant shall be ineligible to Participate in the Plan for the
balance of the Plan Year in which the Unscheduled Withdrawal occurs and
the following Plan Year.

                (5)  A Participant shall be limited to two Unscheduled
Withdrawals during the term of his or her Plan participation.

                (6)  An Unscheduled Withdrawal pursuant to this Section
7.2 of less than 90% of the Participant's Distributable Amount shall be
made pro rata from his or her assumed investments according to the
balances in such investments.  Subject to the foregoing and subject to
the Committee's approval, payment of any amount with respect to which a
Participant has filed a request under this Section 7.2 shall be made in a
single cash lump sum as soon as practicable after the end of the calendar
month in which the Withdrawal election is approved.

    7.3   Unforeseeable Emergency.


          The Committee may, pursuant to rules adopted by it and applied
in a uniform manner, accelerate the date of distribution of a
Participant's Account because of an Unforeseeable Emergency at any time.
"Unforeseeable Emergency" shall mean an unforeseeable, severe financial
condition resulting from (a) a sudden and unexpected illness or accident
of the Participant or his or her dependent (as defined in Section 152(a)
of the Code); (b) loss of the Participant's property due to casualty; or
(c) other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising
as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant, but which
may not be relieved through other available resources of the Participant,
as determined by the Committee in accordance with uniform rules adopted
by it.  Unless the Committee, in its discretion, determines otherwise,
distribution pursuant to this subsection of less than the Participant's
entire interest in the Plan shall be made pro rata from his or her
assumed investments according to the balances in such investments.
Subject to the foregoing, payment of any amount with respect to which a
Participant has filed a request under this subsection shall be made in a
single cash lump sum as soon as practicable after the end of the calendar
month in which the Committee approves the Participant's request.

    7.4   Change of Control.


          Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the contrary,
including, but not limited to, Section 7.5 below, the Distributable
Amount shall be paid to each Participant, or to the Beneficiary of each
deceased Participant, within 30 days after the date of a Change of
Control.  Such amount shall be paid in such form as elected by the
Participant with respect to a distribution by reason of the Participant's
Retirement or, if no such election has been filed, in a lump sum.

    7.5   Section 162(m) Limitation


          If the Committee determines in good faith prior to a Change of
Control that there is a reasonable likelihood that all or any portion of
any payment of benefits under this Section 7 to a Participant would not
be deductible for federal income tax purposes by the Company because of a
limitation on the total amount of the Participant's deductible
compensation from the Company, including any other such compensation
already paid to the Participant earlier in the same fiscal year of the
Company, the following shall apply:

          (a)  Payment of the non-deductible amount shall be deferred
until the first day of the following fiscal year of the Company;

          (b)  If the amount deferred under subsection (a) would exceed
the limitation of the total amount of the Participant's deductible
compensation from the Company for the following fiscal year, the excess
shall be deferred to the first day of the succeeding fiscal year in which
the deductibility of compensation paid or payable to the Participant will
not be so limited, subject to subsection (c);

          (c) In no event shall any payment be deferred under this
Section 7.5 more than three years from the date scheduled for payment
under this Section 7;

          (d)  Adjustment for earning shall continue to be applied under
Section 4.1(d) during the period of deferral under this Section 7.5.

    7.6   Inability To Locate Participant


          In the event that the Committee is unable to locate a
Participant or Beneficiary within two years following the Participant's
Distribution Event, the amount allocated to the Participant's Deferral
Account shall be forfeited.  If, after such forfeiture, the Participant
or Beneficiary later claims such benefit, such benefit (calculated
immediately prior to the forfeiture) shall be reinstated without interest
or earnings.

    9.1   Unsecured General Creditor.


          Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and
assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims, or interests in
any specific property or assets of the Company.  No assets of the Company
shall be held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan.  Any and all of the Company's
assets shall be, and remain, the general unpledged, unrestricted assets
of the Company.  The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely
that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in
the future, and the rights of the Participants and Beneficiaries shall be
no greater than those of unsecured general creditors.

    9.2   Restriction Against Assignment.


          The Company shall pay all amounts payable hereunder only to the
person or persons designated by the Plan and not to any other person or
corporation.  No part of a Participant's Account shall be liable for the
debts, contracts, or engagements of any Participant, his or her
Beneficiary, or successors in interest, nor shall a Participant's Account
be subject to execution by levy, attachment, or garnishment or by any
other legal or equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any
right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any
benefits or payments hereunder in any manner whatsoever.  If any
Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest is adjudicated bankrupt
or purports to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge,
encumber or charge any distribution or payment from the Plan, voluntarily
or involuntarily, the Committee, in its discretion, may cancel such
distribution or payment (or any part thereof) to or for the benefit of
such Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest in such manner as
the Committee shall direct.

the amount of cash sufficient to provide the amount of said taxes.

    9.4   Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Termination.


          The Committee may amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan
in whole or in part, except that no amendment, modification, suspension
or termination shall have any retroactive effect to reduce any amounts
allocated to a Participant's Account, provided that a termination or
suspension of the Plan or any Plan amendment or modification that will
significantly increase costs to the Company shall be approved by the
Board.  In the event that this Plan is terminated, the timing of the
disposition of the amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall
occur in accordance with Section 7.1, subject to earlier distribution at
the discretion of the Committee.

accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon.

    9.6   Receipt or Release.

in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent
thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the Committee and

as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and
release to such effect.

          In the event that any amount becomes payable under the Plan to
a person who, in the sole judgment of the Committee, is considered by
reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid
receipt therefore, the Committee may direct that such payment be made to
any person found by the Committee, in its sole judgment, to have assumed
the care of such person.  Any payment made pursuant to such determination
shall constitute a full release and discharge of the Committee and the
Company.

    9.8   No Employment Rights.

          Participation in this Plan shall not confer upon any person any
right to be employed by the Company or any other right not expressly
