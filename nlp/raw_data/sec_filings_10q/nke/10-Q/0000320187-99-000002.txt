Basis of presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial

indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. 

Year 2000 costs:

     Costs associated with the Company's efforts around Year 2000 issues are 
expensed as incurred, unless they relate to the purchase of hardware and 
software, and software development, in which case they are capitalized.

NOTE 3 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 

SFAS 128, "Earnings per Share," replaces primary and fully diluted 
earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share.  Under the new 
requirements, the dilutive effect of stock options is excluded from the 
calculation of basic earnings per share.  Diluted earnings per share is 
calculated similarly to fully diluted earnings per share as required under 
APB 15.  SFAS 128 became effective for the Company's fiscal 1998 financial 
statements.  All prior period earnings per share data presented have been 
restated to conform to the provisions of this statement.  The following 
represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings 
per share:

NOTE 5 - Restructuring charges:
         ______________________

1998 Charge

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 the Company recorded a 
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's 
actions to better align its cost structure with expected revenue growth rates.  
The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular format) primarily related 
to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities company-wide, resulting in costs 
to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease abandonments related 
to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and elimination of, certain
job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong, resulting in
reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and other costs of downsizing the 
Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the Company's Japan distribution 
center, resulting in the write-down of assets no longer in use; 4) the 
cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term endorsement contracts,
resulting in one-time termination fees; and 5) the decision to exit certain
manufacturing operations of the Bauer subsidiary, resulting in the reduction in
manufacturing related jobs, the write-down of assets no longer in use and the
estimated loss on divestiture of certain manufacturing plants.

     No increases to the 1998 restructing charge were made during the first six 
months of fiscal 1999.  A total of $6.7 million of the restructing accrual was 
not required due to changes in estimates related to severance payments, asset 
valuation and lease commitments.  This amount is included in "other expense" on 
the income statement.

1999 Charge

     In the second quarter of fiscal 1999, an additional $18.7 million 
restructuring charge was recorded due to further cost realignment programs in 
the Company's Asia Pacific region.  The charge (detailed below in tabular 
format) was for costs of severing employees, including severance packages,
lease abandonments and the write down of assets no longer in use.  The charge
is included in other expense on the income statement.

     As of November 30, 1998, there were a total of 1,208 employees terminated 
in the original plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, with 1,168 
having left the Company as of that date. An additional 237 employees were 
terminated in the plan announced during the current quarter, with 138 having 
left the Company as of November 30, 1998.

Detail of the 1998 restructuring charge is as follows:

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results
_________________

     Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 1999 was $68.9 million, a 
51% decrease compared to the $141.1 million in the prior year's second quarter.  
Year-to-date net income decreased 41% to $232.8 million.  Results for both the 
quarter and year-to-date were driven by lower revenues, lower gross margin 
percentages and higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of 
revenues.  In addition, the quarter also includes an $18.7 million restructuring 
charge, discussed further below.

     Consolidated revenues decreased 15%, or $342.3 million for the quarter, and 
12%, or $603.5 million year-to-date.  U.S. brand revenues declined $175.2 
million, or 14% for the quarter, with a 15% decrease in footwear and a 13% 
decrease in apparel revenues.  Year-to-date U.S. revenues decreased 12%, with a 
14% drop in footwear and a 9% decrease in apparel.  Sales in the U.S. are being 
affected by a difficult selling environment at retail, particularly in athletic 
apparel.  Three of the largest apparel categories, Men's Athletic, Team Sports, 
and Accessories decreased 30%, 17% and 34%, respectively, for the quarter.  In 
addition, the uncertainty surrounding the National Basketball Association's 
season has slowed the momentum beginning to be seen in the footwear basketball 
category.  U.S. Basketball footwear revenue was down 24% in the quarter (31% 
year-to-date).  However, Brand Jordan was up 23% in the quarter (45% year-to-
date).  The decline in overall footwear revenues for the quarter was a result of 
a 17% decrease in pairs sold and a 1% increase in average selling price.  The 
major categories of running and crosstraining increased 9% and decreased 40%, 
respectively, for the quarter.  Year-to-date, running decreased 3% while 
crosstraining was down 34%.

     Total revenues in Europe were up 9%, or $37.3 million for the quarter.  For 
the year, revenues increased 11%.  Had the dollar remained constant, revenues 
would have increased 1% and 6% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively.  
The revenue increase was driven by growth in apparel, as footwear revenues were 
down.  Of the major countries within the region, the United Kingdom and France, 
increased 9%, in constant dollars, for the quarter, while Spain and Italy, 
decreased 7% and 5%, respectively.

     The Asia Pacific region remains affected by the general economic crisis in 
the area.  Revenues decreased 46% for the quarter and 47% year-to-date.  Had the 
dollar remained constant, revenues would have decreased 38% for both the quarter 
and year-to-date.  Footwear and apparel revenues were down 56% and 33%, 
respectively, for the quarter.  Revenues in Japan declined 53% (49% on a 
constant dollar basis) for the quarter and 53% for the year (47% on a constant 
dollar basis).

     The Americas region, which includes Canada, Mexico, South America and South 
Africa, decreased 16% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date, compared to last 
year.  Had the dollar remained constant, revenues would have decreased 9% and 7% 
for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, primarily due to the 
strengthening of the dollar in Canada.  

     Other Brands, which includes Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, Sports 
Specialties, and NIKE IHM (which includes what was formally Tetra Plastics), 
decreased 12% for the quarter and less than 1% year-to-date.

     The Company's gross margin percentage for the second quarter was 35.7%, 
down from 37.5% in the prior year.  On a year-to-date basis, margins fell 200 
basis points to 36.8%.  Margins continue to be adversely affected by continued 
efforts to liquidate the Company's closeout inventories around the world, 
particularly apparel.  Additionally, increased levels of research and 
development spending on reduced levels of comparative revenues, further reduced 
margins.
 
     Selling and administrative expenses have decreased 10% from last year's 
second quarter and 5% year-to-date, however are up as a percentage of revenues, 
to 27.8% for the quarter (compared to 26.3%) and 26.8% for the year (compared to 
24.9%).  Sports marketing and advertising reductions accounted for more than 50% 
of the reduction for the quarter, and wage related expenses fell 4%.  Spending 
levels continue to reflect management's efforts to control expenditures.  

     Interest expense has decreased for both the quarter and year-to-date, 
compared to last year, as less short term debt has been needed to finance lower 
levels of inventories and accounts receivable.  Other expense has increased over 
the prior year, mainly due to the $18.7 million restructuring charge taken in 
the second quarter (discussed further below).  Offsetting this charge was a $6.7 
million reversal of fiscal 1998's restructuring charge and reduced foreign 
currency transaction losses.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear and 
apparel scheduled for delivery from December 1998 through April 1999 totaled 
$3.8 billion, 10% lower than such orders for the same period last year.  These 
orders and the percentage change in these orders are not necessarily indicative 
of the change in revenues which the Company will experience for subsequent 
periods.  This is due to potential shifts in the mix of advance orders in 
relation to at once orders and varying cancellation rates.  Finally exchange 
rate fluctuations will also cause differences in the comparisons.

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company recorded a 
restructuring charge of $129.9 million as a result of certain of the Company's 
actions to better align its overall cost structure and organization with planned 
revenue levels. The restructuring activities (shown below in tabular format) 
primarily related to: 1) the elimination of job responsibilities company-wide, 
resulting in costs to sever employees and related asset write-downs and lease 
abandonments related to the affected employees; 2) the relocation of, and 
elimination of, certain job responsibilities of the Asia Pacific headquarters in 
Hong Kong, resulting in reduction in workforce, lease abandonments and other 
costs of downsizing the Hong Kong headquarters; 3) the downsizing of the 
Company's Japan distribution center, resulting in the write-down of assets no 
longer in use; 4) the cancellation of certain non-strategic long-term 
endorsement contracts, resulting in one-time termination fees; and 5) the 
decision to exit certain manufacturing operations of the Bauer subsidiary, 
resulting in the reduction in manufacturing related jobs, the write-down of 
assets no longer in use and the estimated loss on divestiture of certain 
manufacturing plants.

     No increases to the 1998 restructuring charge were made during the first 
six months of fiscal 1999.  A total of  $6.7 million of the restructuring 
accrual was not required due to changes in estimates related to severance 
payments, asset valuations and lease commitments.  This amount is included in 
"other expense" on the income statement.  

     In the second quarter of fiscal 1999, an additional $18.7 million 
restructuring charge was recorded due to further cost realignment programs in 
the Company's Asia Pacific region.  The charge (detailed below in tabular 
format) was for costs of severing employees, including severance packages, lease 
abandonments and the write down of assets no longer in use.  The charge is 
included in "other expense" on the income statement.

     As of November 30, 1998, there were a total of 1,208 employees terminated 
in the original plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, with 1,168 
having left the Company as of that date. An additional 237 employees were 
terminated in the plan announced during the current quarter, with 138 having 
left the Company as of November 30, 1998.


Detail of the 1998 restructuring charge is as follows:

of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative 
instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133).  FAS 133 is effective for all 
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 (June 1, 2000 
for the Company).  This statement will require the Company to recognize all 
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of 
derivatives will be recorded in current earnings or other comprehensive income, 
depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  
The ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current-period 
earnings.  Management of the Company has not yet determined the impact that the 
adoption of FAS 133 will have on the Company's results from operations or its 
financial position.

Year 2000 issue
_______________

	The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs using two digits 
rather than four to define the applicable year.  Such software may recognize a 
date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This could result 
in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the Company's 
activities and operations (the "year 2000" or "Y2K" issue).  If the Company or 
its significant suppliers or customers fail to make necessary modifications, 
conversions, and contingency plans on a timely basis, the year 2000 issue could 
have a material adverse effect on NIKE's business, operations, cash flow, and 
financial condition.  However, the effect cannot be quantified at this time 
because NIKE cannot accurately estimate the magnitude, duration, or ultimate 
impact of noncompliance by third parties that have no direct relationship to 
NIKE.  The Company believes that its competitors face a similar risk.  Although 
not quantifiable, the disclosure below is intended to summarize NIKE's actions 
to minimize that risk.

	In May 1997, the Company established a corporate-wide project team to 
identify non-compliant software and complete the corrections or plans required 
to mitigate the year 2000 issue.  NIKE has identified three categories of 
software and systems that require attention:  

(1)	information technology ("IT") systems, such as mainframes, PCs, 
networks, and production control system, 

(2)	non-IT systems, such as equipment, machinery, climate control, and 
security systems, which may contain microcontrollers with embedded 
technology, and 

(3)	partner (supplier and customer) IT and non-IT systems.  

The Company intends to fix or replace non-compliant IT and non-IT software and 
systems through the following project phases:

(1)	inventory systems, 

(2) 	assess risks and impact, 

(3)	prioritize projects, 

(4)	fix, replace, or develop contingency plans for non-compliant 
systems, 

(5)	test and on-going quality control, and 

(6)	audit results.  

Currently, our remediation projects are at different phases of completion.  
Remediation and testing activities are underway or have been completed on all of 
the Company's critical business applications. NIKE engages the services of 
independent consultants to analyze and develop testing standards, quality 
assurance, and contingency plans.  NIKE's internal auditing department audits 
the process and remediation testing, and NIKE has consulted with external 
independent consultants to evaluate and audit those results.

	Recently, NIKE's Y2K project team completed a mid-project review  
of all projects not yet completed.  The result was the consolidation of
several projects, the elimination of redundant projects, and the
identification of several additional projects that need to be addressed.  To 
date, NIKE has identified 148 major internal I.T. remediation projects 
worldwide. That number may increase slightly if anticipated "gaps" in 
remediation are identified later.  As of December 31, 1998, 77 of the
projects have been completed (including testing).  Of the remaining
projects, approximately 50 percent are in final test and implementation
phases.  The Company has already completed remediation on most of its
critical business information systems.  

	The Company is also assessing the compliance of its major customers and 
suppliers.  NIKE has relationships with certain significant suppliers and 
customers in most of the locations in which it operates. The level of 
preparedness of significant suppliers and customers can very greatly from 
country to country.  These relationships are material to many local operations 
and, in the aggregate, are material to the Company.  NIKE relies on suppliers to 
timely deliver a broad range of goods and services worldwide, including raw 
materials, footwear, apparel, accessories, equipment, advertising, 
transportation services, banking services, telecommunications and utilities.  
Moreover, NIKE's suppliers rely on countless other suppliers, over which NIKE 
may have little or no influence regarding year 2000 compliance.  NIKE believes 
that suppliers and customers presents  the area of greatest risk to the Company 
in part because of the Company's limited ability to influence actions of third 
parties, and in part because of the Company's inability to estimate the level 
and impact of noncompliance of third parties throughout the extended supply 
chain.

	NIKE is sending surveys to and conducting formal communications with its 
significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which it may be 
affected by those third parties' Y2K preparedness plans.  Some of NIKE's 
significant suppliers and customers have not responded to inquiries from NIKE, 
have refused to respond for liability reasons, or have not responded with 
sufficient detail for NIKE to determine (a) whether the supplier or customer is 
or timely will be Y2K compliant, or (b) if any noncompliance will have a 
material adverse effect on NIKE's business or financial condition.  In the 
absence of adequate responses and disclosures, NIKE is attempting to make 
independent assessments of significant vendors and customers.  However, a 
compliance failure by a major supplier or customer, or one of their suppliers or 
customers, could have a material adverse effect on NIKE's business or financial 
condition.  The size of that effect cannot be quantified at this time because of 
variables such as the type and importance of the non-responding suppliers and 
customers, the unknown level and duration of noncompliance of suppliers and 
customers (and their suppliers and customers), the possible effect on NIKE's 
operations, and NIKE's ability to respond.  Thus, there can be no assurance that 
there will not be a material adverse effect on the Company if third party 
governmental or business entities do not convert or replace their systems in a 
timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the Company's systems. 

	As a result, in some cases NIKE will develop contingency plans that 
assume some estimated level of noncompliance by, or business disruption to, 
suppliers and customers.  The Company is currently developing those contingency 
plans, with the goal of completing them by mid-1999 for significant suppliers 
and customers determined to be at high risk of noncompliance or business 
disruption.  The contingency plans are being developed on a case-by-case basis, 
and may include booking orders and producing products before anticipated 
business disruptions, manual intervention, or finding alternative suppliers.  
Even so, judgments regarding contingency plans - such as how to develop them and 
to what extent - are themselves subject to many variables and uncertainties.  
There can be no assurance that NIKE will correctly anticipate the level, impact 
or duration of noncompliance by suppliers and customers that provide inadequate 
information.  As a result, there is no certainty that its contingency plans will 
be sufficient to mitigate the impact of noncompliance by suppliers and 
customers, and some material adverse effect to NIKE may result from one or more 
third parties regardless of defensive contingency plans.

	Costs related to the year 2000 issue are funded through operating cash 
flows.  Through the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company expended 
approximately $31 million in remediation efforts, including the cost of new 
software, modifying the applicable code of existing software, and internal 
costs.  Approximately $7 million of these expenditures was for new hardware 
and software, and has been capitalized.  The remainder has been expensed as 
incurred.  

	The Company currently estimates that total costs related to the year 2000 
issue will be composed of approximately $45 to $50 million in external expenses, 
$20 to $25 million in internal costs, and $40 to $45 million in replacement 
projects that are not Y2K-related but have some Y2K remediation benefits.  
Approximately $10 million of these expenses will be capitalized.  (Previously
the Company did not report internal costs or unrelated replacement projects.)
The Company presently believes that the total cost of achieving year 2000
compliant systems is not expected to be material to NIKE's financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations.

	Estimates of time, cost, and risk estimates are based on currently 
available information.  Developments that could affect estimates include, but 
are not limited to, the availability and cost of trained personnel; the ability 
to locate and correct all relevant computer code and systems; cooperation and 
remediation success of the Company's suppliers and customers (and their 
suppliers and customers); and the ability to correctly anticipate risks and 
implement suitable contingency plans in the event of system failures at NIKE or 
its suppliers and customers (and their suppliers and customers).

	The above section, even if incorporated by reference into other documents
or disclosures, is a Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure as defined under 
the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act of 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's financial position remained strong at November 30, 1998.  
Compared to May 31, 1998 shareholder's equity remained consistent at $3.2 
billion.  Working capital decreased 6% to $1.7 billion and the current ratio was 
2.10:1 at November 30, 1998 compared to 2.07:1 at May 31, 1998.

     Cash provided by operations increased $382 million compared to the first 
six months of last year.   Working capital changes were the main reason for the 
increase, primarily the decrease in accounts receivable, due to lower revenue, 
and the decrease in inventory levels.  Consolidated inventory levels at November 
30, 1998 were 17% lower than last November and 14% lower than May 31, 1998.  
Closeout levels in footwear inventory continued to fall to more normal levels in 
all regions.  In apparel, the Company was able to reduce closeout levels in 
every region except Europe.  The advancement of the Company's retail strategy 
around the world has helped sell through of closeout product.  During the second 
quarter the Company added 13 new outlet locations: 6 in the U.S., 4 in Europe 
and one each in Japan, Australia and Canada.  The total outlet store count is 95 
globally, with 64 of those in the U.S.

     Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first half of fiscal 
1999 were $173.6 million, mainly due to the expansion of the U.S. headquarters, 
retail locations and customer service distribution facilities.  Outside of the 
U.S., the majority of the expenditures were related to the Company's customer 
service distribution center in Europe and retail expansion in all regions.  In 
the previous year, expenditures were higher due to increased NIKETOWN 
expenditures in the U.S. and more activity surrounding the European customer 
service facility.

     Management believes that significant funds generated by operations, 
together with access to sufficient sources of funds, will adequately meet its 
anticipated operating, global infrastructure expansion and capital needs.  
The Company maintains significant short and long-term lines of credit with
banks, which, along with cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity.
Liquidity is also provided by the Company's commercial paper program, under
which there was $167.8 million outstanding at November 30, 1998.

     Dividends per share of common stock for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 
remained at $.12 per share, the same level as the previous year.

     As of November 30, 1998, the Company purchased a total of 6.4 million 
shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $252 million in the open market since 
the $1 billion share repurchase program was approved in December 1997.  During 
the first half of fiscal 1999, the Company purchased a total of 5.2 million 
shares for $198 million.  Funding has, and is expected to continue to, come from 
operating cash flow in conjunction with short-term borrowings.  The timing and 
the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working capital needs and 
stock market conditions.

                  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                           and Reports Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference 
from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other 
reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, 
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning 
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("the Act").  Forward-
looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, 
forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and 
may contain the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," 
"will be," "will continue," "will result," or words or phrases of similar 
meaning.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may 
cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  
The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by 
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among 
others, the following:  international, national and local general economic and 
market conditions (including the current Asian economic problems); the size and 
growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense 
competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic 
footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic 
changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, 
categories of products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE 
products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; fluctuations 
and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, 
the fact that advance "futures" orders may not be indicative of future revenues 
due to the changing mix of futures and at-once orders; the ability of NIKE to 
sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; new product development 
and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and 
other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer 
service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; 
dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions due to Year 2000 
noncompliance by NIKE, its suppliers or customers (or their suppliers or 
customers); increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery 
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks 
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without 
limitation, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic 
instability; changes in government regulations; liability and other claims 
asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and 
other reports.  

     The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this 
report may include additional factors which could adversely impact NIKE's 
business and financial performance.  Moreover, NIKE operates in a very 
competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from 
time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk 
factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's 
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may 
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not 
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual 
results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, 
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose 
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial 
information.  Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with 
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of 
the statement or report.  Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or 
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.  Thus, to the 
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, 
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
