NOTE 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies: 
         ___________________________________________ 
 
Basis of Presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial 
statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring 
accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair 
presentation of the results of operations for the interim period(s). 
The interim financial information and notes thereto should be read in 
conjunction with the Company's latest annual report to shareholders. 
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended February 
28, 1998 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the 
entire year. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 
 
     SFAS 128, "Earnings per Share," replaces primary and fully diluted 
earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share.  Under the 
new requirements, the dilutive effect of stock options is excluded from 
the calculation of basic earnings per share.  Diluted earnings per share 
is calculated similarly to fully diluted earnings per share as required 
under APB 15.  SFAS 128 became effective for the Company's 1998 third 
quarter financial statements.  All prior period earnings per share data 
presented have been restated to conform to the provisions of this 
statement.  The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings 
per share to diluted earnings per share:

NOTE 5 - Change in year-end of certain subsidiaries: 
         __________________________________________ 
 
     Prior to fiscal year 1997, certain of the Company's non-U.S. 
operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag 
which allowed more time to compile results.  Beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated.  As a 
result, the May 1996 charge from operations for these entities of 
$4.1 million was recorded to retained earnings in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 1997. 
 
 
Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 1998 decreased 69% to 
$73.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $237.1 million, 
or $0.80 per diluted share last year.  Year to date, net income decreased 
27%.  Revenues decreased 8% for the quarter, while increasing 6% on a 
year-to-date basis.  For the quarter, gross margins decreased to 35.8% 
compared to 40.8% last year.  Year-to-date margins were 37.8% compared to 
40.2% in the prior year. Selling and administrative expenses increased as 
a percentage of revenue to 29.3% for the quarter and 26.3% year-to-date, 
compared to 23.8% and 24.0% for the previous year's quarter and 
year-to-date, respectively.  The Company's results of operations for the 
quarter and nine months ended February 28, 1998 are most significantly a 
result of lower growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions.  In 
the U.S., both footwear and apparel revenues declined in the quarter, 
primarily due to the saturation of retail athletic footwear and apparel 
markets.  In Asia Pacific, the recent economic crisis in key markets in 
that region has resulted in reduced consumer spending. 
 
The Company is currently undergoing a cost evaluation initiative and 
will incur a restructuring charge of between $125 and $175 million in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998.  Included in the charge will be charges 
associated with the reduction in the Company's global workforce, lease 
abandonments, asset write-downs and other costs.  These measures, combined 
with the Company's efforts to maintain an efficient cost structure in the 
face of a difficult short-term market in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, are 
expected to result in projected reduced spending in excess of $100 
million in fiscal 1999. 
 
For the quarter ended February 28, 1998, total revenues decreased $199.7 
million and increased $432.8 million year-to-date.  U.S. brand revenues 
decreased 15% and 1% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. 
U.S. footwear revenue declines were the primary reason, with revenue down 
18% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date.  The decrease for the quarter 
was due to a 9% decrease in pairs sold and an 11% average reduction in 
selling price.  While most core footwear categories experienced decreases 
for the quarter, the three largest category increases were in golf 
(up 117%), soccer (up 80%), and Brand Jordan (up 125%).  U.S. apparel 
revenues decreased 5% for the quarter, but increased 10% on a year-to-date 
basis. For the quarter, golf was up 55% while the core apparel categories 
of training and basketball were down 10% and 22%, respectively. 
 
Non-U.S. brand revenues decreased 1% for the quarter and increased 
18% year-to-date.  Had the dollar remained constant with that of the 
prior year, non-U.S. revenues would have increased 9% for the quarter 
and 29% year-to-date.  Europe increased 4% for the quarter (11% on a 
constant dollar basis) with footwear down 12% and apparel up 35%. 
The top five countries in the region, which represent 64% and 67% of the 
total revenue for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, increased 
5% for the quarter and 13% for the year.  Italy, France and Spain all had 
double digit growth in constant dollars.  The Asia Pacific region 
decreased 17% for the quarter (down 2% on a constant dollar basis). 
Footwear revenues in the region were down 26%, while apparel increased 6%. 
Japan, which a year ago had increased 107% quarter on quarter, had flat 
revenues operationally, and was down 10% including the effect of exchange 
rates.  The Americas region, which includes Latin America and Canada, 
increased 27% for the quarter (32% on a constant dollar basis) and both 
footwear and apparel revenues increased to 14% and 72%, respectively. 
 
Other and Other Brands, which includes NIKE brand equipment, Bauer Inc., 
Cole Haan, Sports Specialties, and Tetra Plastics, increased 6% to $118.3 
million for the third quarter and 5% to $425.3 million year-to-date.  The 
increase was due to NIKE brand equipment partially offset by a decline 
in the Other Brands.

</TABLE> 
 
 
The overall decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for 
both the quarter and year-to-date, compared to the prior year, was due 
to four principal factors.  First was the increase in close-out product 
sales compared to the prior year.  The regions most affected by this 
were the U.S. and Asia Pacific.  Second, inventory reserves increased 
to write down slow-moving inventory that has been unable to be sold in 
the marketplace.  Third, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a 
direct impact on the Company's ability to price product in competitive 
markets.  Finally, increased levels of warehousing, royalties, and 
research and development costs have had the effect of lowering margins 
due to the smaller revenue base.  Management expects that the gross 
margin percentage for fiscal 1998 will continue to be below levels 
experienced in the prior year. 
 
Selling and administrative expenses increased $73.8 million over the 
previous year's third quarter and $265.8 million year-to-date.  The 
increases are due to higher levels of marketing expenses, including 
spending in the third quarter surrounding the Winter Olympics and 
endorsement contracts.  Infrastructure spending has also increased, 
however wage-related increases over the prior year are beginning to slow 
down as cost-cutting measures take effect.  Selling and administrative 
expenses are expected to remain higher than last year's levels, as a 
percentage of revenue, through the end of fiscal 1998. 
 
Interest expense, while down for the third quarter, increased on a 
year-to-date basis due to increased debt, both short and long-term, for 
growing infrastructure and financing increased levels of inventory. 
Other expense has increased on a year-to-date basis, primarily due to 
decreased interest income and increased losses on foreign transactions, 
offset by decreased profit sharing expense. 
 
The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.4% compared 
to 38.75% in the prior year.  Year-to-date the rate has risen to 38.8% 
compared to 38.7%.  The increase in the rate is primarily due to a lower 
mix of non-U.S. earnings to total. 
 
Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE brand athletic footwear 
and apparel scheduled for delivery from March 1998 through July 1998 
totaled $4.0 billion, 9% lower than such orders for the same period last 
year.  These orders and the percentage change in these orders are not 
necessarily indicative of the change in revenues which the Company will 
experience for subsequent periods.  This is due to potential shifts in 
the mix of advance orders in relation to at once orders and varying 
cancellation rates.  Finally exchange rate fluctuations will also cause 
differences in the comparisons. 
 
 
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
_______________________________ 
 
The Company's financial position remains strong at February 28, 1998. 
Compared to May 31, 1997, total assets increased $277 million to $5.6 
billion while shareholder's equity increased $219 million to $3.4 
billion.  Working capital increased $92 million, to $2.1 billion at 
February 28, 1998, and the Company's current ratio was unchanged 
from fiscal year-end at 2.1.  The increase in working capital is 
primarily a result of higher inventory levels due to the slow down in 
revenue growth.  The Company has taken steps to reduce inventory levels. 
These include actions to sell close-out inventory as well as to moderate 
inventory purchases to more cautiously match up with futures orders and 
at-once demand. 
 
Cash provided by operations was $161 million for the nine months ended 
February 28,1998, an increase of $104 million over last year's first nine 
months, primarily due to decreased working capital requirements as a 
result of lower growth rates compared to the first nine months of 
fiscal 1997. 
 
Additions to property, plant and equipment for the first nine months of 
fiscal 1998 were $352 million compared to $318 million for the same 
period last year.  Additions in the U.S. totaled $158 million due to 
continued overall expansion of U.S. operations which includes warehouse 
locations, world headquarters expansion, management information systems 
and the continued development of retail locations.  Outside the U.S., 
additions totaled $181 million due to the development and expansion of 
new and existing warehouse facilities as well as the development of 
retail locations.  The Company expects total capital expenditures for 
fiscal 1998 to be approximately $550 million. 
 
Additions to long-term debt totaled $101 million for the first nine 
months of fiscal 1998.  In fiscal 1997 the Company filed a shelf 
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale 
of up to $500 million of debt securities.  Under this program, the 
Company issued $100 million medium term notes in the first quarter of 
fiscal 1998, maturing in three and five years.  The proceeds were swapped 
into Dutch Guilders and the Company used this long-term fixed rate debt 
financing, in addition to excess cash, to retire the Company's Dutch 
Guilder external short-term debt.  Management believes that significant 
funds generated by operations, together with access to sufficient sources 
of funds, will adequately meet its anticipated operating, global 
infrastructure expansion and capital needs.  Significant short and 
long-term lines of credit are maintained with banks which, along with 
cash on hand, provide adequate operating liquidity.  Liquidity is also 
provided by the Company's commercial paper program, under which there was 
$328 million outstanding at February 28, 1998. 
 
During the quarter, the Company purchased a total of 2.7 million shares 
of NIKE's Class B common stock for $123.2 million, completing the $450 
million program approved in July 1993 and beginning the four-year, $1 
billion program approved in December 1997.  In the quarter, 2.4 million 
shares were purchased under the July 1993 program for $108.2 million. 
Total shares purchased since July 1993 were 23.8 million.  Under the new 
$1 billion program, the Company purchased a total of 355,000 shares for 
$15.0 million.  Funding has, and is expected to continue to, come from 
operating cash flow in conjunction with short-term borrowings. The timing 
and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working capital 
needs and stock market conditions.

from the forward-looking statements.  The risks and uncertainties are 
detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the S.E.C., 
including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among others, the 
following:  international, national and local general economic and 
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, 
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, 
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and 
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in 
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of 
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; 
the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; fluctuations 
and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without 
limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not be indicative 
of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-once 
orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth; 
new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and 
protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property; 
performance and reliability of products; customer service; adverse 
publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on 
distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and 
transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy 
or development plans; general risks associated with doing business 
outside the United States, including, without limitation, import duties, 
tariffs, quotas and political instability; changes in government 
regulations; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors 
referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other 
reports. 
 
     The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this 
report may include additional factors which could adversely impact 
NIKE's business and financial performance.  Moreover, NIKE operates in a 
very competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors 
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to 
predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such 
risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to which any factor, or 
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially 
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these 
risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on 
forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. 
 
     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to 
time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy 
to disclose to them any material non-public information or other 
confidential commercial information.  Accordingly, shareholders should 
not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any 
analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. 
Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial 
forecasts or projections issued by others.  Accordingly, to the extent 
that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, 
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
