              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
NOTE 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies: 
         ___________________________________________ 
 
Basis of Presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial 
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations 
for the three and six months ended November 30, 1995 are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 
 
     Net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average 
number of common and common equivalent (stock option) shares outstanding 
for the period(s). 
 
     On October 30, 1995, the Company effected a two-for-one split of the 
outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock 
dividend.  The applicable outstanding shares and net income per common share 
figures for previous periods have been restated to reflect this change.

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
     Net income increased 39.2% and 48.2% for the second quarter ended 
and six months ended November 30, 1995, respectively, over the prior 
year's comparable periods.  Net income for the quarter and six months 
ended November 30, 1995 totaled $118.2 million, or $0.80 per share, and 
$283.0 million, or $1.93, respectively, compared with $84.9, or $0.58 
per share, and $190.9, or $1.29 per share, for the same periods last 
year.  For the quarter ended November 30, 1995, as compared to 
the prior year revenues increased 37% to a record $1.443 billion, 
gross margin percentage remained flat at 39.3%, and selling and 
administrative expenses was reduced 0.7 percentage points as a 
percentage of revenues, to 24.8%.   This was the Company's seventh 
consecutive quarter of record revenues and fifth consecutive quarter of 
record net income, comopared to the same period of the prior year. 
 
     Revenues for the quarter increased $389.3 million over the $1.054 
billion reported in the same period of the prior year, reflecting 
increases in nearly all categories of both footwear and apparel 
in the U.S. and internationally.  U.S. revenues increased $180.9 
million, or 33%, lead by apparel which increased $97.9 million, or 100%, 
to $195.8 million compared with the second quarter last year.  U.S. 
footwear increased $83 million, or 18%, to $538.5 million, resulting 
from a 12% increase in pairs shipped and a 6% increase in average 
selling price.  Revenues from international (non-U.S.) operations 
increased $133.3 million, or 30%, to $573.3 million, composed of 29% a
nd 34% increases in international footwear and apparel revenues, 
respectively.  Comparisons of units and average selling price 
is not as meaningful to apparel due to the significant variation of 
apparel product mix.  Other brands, which includes Cole Haan (R), Tetra 
Plastics, Sports Specialties and Canstar Sports, increased $75.0 
million.  $67.0 million of this increase relates to Canstar Sports, 
which was acquired in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.  The 
breakdown of revenues follows:

     Consolidated gross margin percentage remained flat at 39.3% and 
39.7% for the quarter and six months ended November 30, 1995, 
respectively, compared with the same periods last year.  Strong demand 
for NIKE products worldwide combined with sound inventory management 
resulted in continued stable margins.  The Company continues to place 
strong emphasis on inventory management, minimizing foreign exchange 
risk and production sourcing in order to maximize gross profit.  Gross 
profit percentages for the remaining six months of fiscal year 1996 are 
expected to be affected by strong demand for NIKE products offset by 
continued increased levels of air freight to meet the delivery dates on 
increasing customer orders. 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $89.7 million and 
$156.9 million for the quarter and six months ended November 30, 1995, 
respectively, compared with same periods last year.  For the quarter, 
U.S. NIKE brand operations accounted for the majority of the increase, 
up $57 million, primarily in planned marketing and advertising expenses.  
International expenses increased $20 million for the quarter over last 
year, with $4 million due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.  
Canstar Sports added $11 million of expenses.  The Company expects to 
continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through of the 
unprecedented volume of customer orders discussed below.  As a 
result, the Company expects that selling and administrative expenses as 
a percentage of revenues for the remaining six months of the this fiscal 
year will increase to levels consistent with the prior year. 
 
     Interest expense increased $4.0 million and $10.7 million for the 
quarter and six months ended November 30, 1995, respectively, compared 
with the same periods last year.  The increase is due to increased short 
term borrowings in the U.S. and international operations needed to fund 
current operations.  In the prior year, cash and equivalents 
were higher through November 30, as available cash was subsequently used 
to fund the third quarter acquisition of Canstar Sports. Other expense 
increased $7.1 million and $16.3 million for the quarter and six months 
ended November 30, 1995, respectively, compared with the same periods 
last year.  The increase is primarily due to increased goodwill 
amortization resulting from the acquisition of Canstar Sports, and 
decreased interest income from lower available cash. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for both the quarter and six 
months ended November 30, 1995 was 38.5%, compared to 39.0% in both of 
the prior year's comparable periods.  The Company anticipates that the 
tax rate will remain at 38.5% for fiscal year 1996. 
 
     Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from December 1995 through April 1996 are 
approximately $2.7 billion, 34% higher than such orders booked in 
the comparable period of the prior year.  These orders are not 
necessarily indicative of total revenues over that period because 
the mix of advance orders and "at once" shipments may vary 
significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.  
Additionally, as international operations continue to account for 
a greater percentage of total revenues and place greater emphasis on 
futures orders, this mix again may vary.  Finally, exchange 
rates can cause differences in the comparisons. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
     The Company's financial position remains strong, with working 
capital rising $190 million since May 31, 1995.  In addition, the 
working capital ratio increased from 1.8:1 at May 31, 1995 to 2.0:1 at 
November 30, 1995. 
 
     Cash and equivalents decreased $11.2 million from May 31, 1995. 
Cash provided by operations was reduced by changes in other 
working capital components discussed below.  Other significant uses of 
cash included additions to property, plant and equipment, reductions in 
long-term debt and dividends paid.  The most significant source of 
cash was from an increase in notes payable. 
 
     The decrease in cash due to other working capital components 
was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, 
offset by increases in accrued liabilities.  The increase in accounts 
receivable of $131.6 million was due to sales growth in both October 
and November over last fiscal year's final two months.  Overall 
inventories increased $81.1 million in conjunction with levels of 
operations.  U.S. footwear, U.S. apparel and international footwear 
and apparel inventories have increased $20.8 million, $18.5 million 
and $30.1 million, respectively.  Increases in accrued liabilities 
are a result of the increased levels of the Company's operations, 
most significantly, international operations. 
 
     The additions to property, plant and equipment were composed 
of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European 
footwear warehouses, expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and 
acquisition of land adjacent to the world headquarters. 
 
     The Company also utilized cash to retire long-term debt acquired in 
the purchase of Canstar Sports. 
 
     Notes payable increased in order to fund the high level of 
operations. 
 
     During the quarter, the Company announced a 20% increase in the 
quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from the previous $0.125 
per share. 
 
     For the six months ended November 30, 1995, the Company has 
purchased 200,000 shares of its own stock under the stock repurchase 
program announced in July 1993, bringing the total number of shares 
purchased in the program to approximately 5,149,000.  There were no 
purchases during the second quarter.
 
     The debt to equity ratio at November 30, 1995 was .6:1 compared 
to .6:1 at May 31, 1995 and .4:1 at November 30, 1994.  Management 
believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources, will adequately finance anticipated 
fiscal 1996 expenditures.  At November 30, 1995, the Company 
had $500 million available in committed unused lines of credit.
