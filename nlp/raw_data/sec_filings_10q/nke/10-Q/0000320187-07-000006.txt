       NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         __________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The year-end condensed
consolidated balance sheet data as of May 31, 2006 was derived from audited
financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The
interim financial information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction
with the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of
operations for the six (6) months ended November 30, 2006 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in the Company's financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The provisions of FIN 48
are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FIN 48.

     In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 06-2, "Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other
Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43" ("EITF 06-2").  EITF 06-2
clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees' rights to
compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement.
The provisions of EITF 06-2 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June
1, 2007 and will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
earnings.  The Company has evaluated the provisions of EITF 06-2 and does not
expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.  The provisions of FAS 157 are
effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008.  The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("FAS 158"). FAS
158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with
single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other
postretirement plans in their financial statements.  The provisions of FAS 158
are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. The
Company has evaluated the provisions of FAS 158 and does not expect that the
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

     In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB 108").  SAB 108
requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and
income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement as material, when all relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered.  The guidance in SAB 108 is effective for
the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007.  The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the provisions of SAB 108.

         ___________

     Inventory balances of $2,167.2 million and $2,076.7 million at November
30, 2006 and May 31, 2006, respectively, were substantially all finished

NOTE 5 - Income Taxes:
         ____________

     The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended November
30, 2006 of 27.2% and 31.3%, respectively, has decreased from the fiscal 2006
effective tax rate of 35.0%.  The decrease is primarily due to a tax agreement
with the Dutch tax authorities entered into during the three months ended
November 30, 2006, which reduces the Company's income taxes for fiscal 2006
through fiscal 2015. A catch up adjustment for the retroactive tax benefit for
fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is reflected in the effective
tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2006.

NOTE 7 - Stock-Based Compensation
         ________________________


     In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved,
the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1990 Plan"). The 1990 Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 66 million previously unissued shares of
Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted
under the plan.  The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses and
the issuance and sale of restricted stock. The exercise price for non-
statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights and the grant price of
restricted stock may not be less than 75% of the market price of the
underlying shares on the date of grant. The exercise price for incentive stock
options may not be less than the market price of the underlying shares on
the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990
Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom
awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and
conditions of the awards. The committee has granted substantially all stock
options and restricted stock at 100% of the market price on the date of grant.
Substantially all grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the
first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10
years from the date of grant.

     In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to
purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock
purchase plans ("ESPPs").  Employees are eligible to participate through
payroll deductions up to 10% of their compensation.  At the end of each six-
month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the ending of the offering
period.  In each of the six months ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, employees
purchased 0.2 million shares.

     On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R "Share-Based Payment"
("FAS 123R") which requires the Company to record expense for stock-based
compensation to employees using a fair value method. Under FAS 123R, the
Company estimates the fair value of options granted under the 1990 Plan and
employees' purchase rights under the ESPPs using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model.  The Company recognizes this fair value as selling and
administrative expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method.

     The following table summarizes the effects of applying FAS 123R during
the six months ended November 30, 2006. The resulting stock-based compensation
expense primarily relates to stock options.

1  In accordance with FAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense reported
during the three and six months ended November 30, 2006, includes $1.0
million, net of tax, no effect per diluted share, and $23.3 million, net of
tax, or $0.09 per diluted share, respectively, of accelerated stock-based
compensation expense recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock
option vesting upon retirement. Because the Company usually grants the
majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of each
fiscal year, under FAS 123R, accelerated vesting will normally result in
higher expense in the first three months of the fiscal year.

</TABLE>

     As of November 30, 2006, the Company had $181.1 million of unrecognized
compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be
recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average
period of 2.5 years.

     The Company has adopted the modified prospective transition method
prescribed by FAS 123R, which does not require the restatement of financial
results for previous periods. In accordance with this transition method,
the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the
three and six months ended November 30, 2006 includes (1) amortization
of outstanding stock-based compensation granted prior to, but not vested, as
of June 1, 2006, based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
("FAS 123") and (2) amortization of all stock-based awards granted subsequent
to June 1, 2006, based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of FAS 123R.

     Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company used the intrinsic value
method to account for stock options and ESPP shares in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" as permitted by FAS 123. If the Company had instead
accounted for stock options and ESPP shares issued to employees using the fair
value method prescribed by FAS 123 during the three and six months
ended November 30, 2005, the Company's pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share would have been reported as follows:

1  Accelerated stock-based compensation expense for options subject to
accelerated vesting due to employee retirement is not included in the pro
forma figures shown above for the three and six months ended November
30, 2005.  This disclosure reflects the expense of such options ratably over
the stated vesting period or upon actual employee retirement.  Had the Company
recognized the fair value for such stock options on an accelerated basis in
this pro forma disclosure, the Company would have recognized less stock-based
compensation expense of $1.2 million, net of tax, no effect per diluted share,
for the three months ended November 30, 2005 and additional stock-based
compensation expense of $19.1 million, net of tax, or $0.07 per diluted share
for the six months ended November 30, 2005.

     The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during
the six months ended November 30, 2006 and 2005 as computed using the Black-
Scholes pricing model was $17.54 and $19.35, respectively.  The weighted
average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows:

     Expected volatility is estimated based on the implied volatility in
market traded options on the Company's common stock, with a term greater than
one year. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an
analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns.  The interest
rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in
effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term
of the options.

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase an additional 10.8 million
and 5.6 million shares of common stock were outstanding for the three months
ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and 9.2 million and 5.6
million shares of common stock were outstanding for the six months ended
November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, respectively, but were not included
in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options were
antidilutive.

NOTE 9 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions for operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity excluding
NIKE Golf and NIKE Bauer Hockey.  Each NIKE brand geographic segment operates
predominantly in one industry:  the design, production, marketing and selling
of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. The "Other" category
shown below represents activities of Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, Converse
Inc., Exeter Brands Group LLC, Hurley International LLC, NIKE Bauer Hockey
Inc., and NIKE Golf, which are considered immaterial for individual disclosure
based on the aggregation criteria in SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information."

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents income before income taxes as shown in the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Reconciling items for pre-tax
income represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting including corporate activity, stock-based
compensation expense, certain currency exchange rate gains and losses on
transactions, and intercompany eliminations for specific income statement
items in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Accounts receivable, net, inventories, and property, plant and equipment,
net for operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided
below.

NOTE 10 - Commitments and Contingencies:
         _____________________________

     At November 30, 2006, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling $149.3 million.  These letters of credit were issued primarily for
the purchase of inventory.

     There have been no other significant subsequent developments
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

     In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, revenues grew 10% to $3.8 billion,
net income grew 8% to $325.6 million and we delivered diluted earnings per
share of $1.28, a 12% increase versus the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
During the quarter, the Company finalized a new ten-year tax agreement with
the Dutch tax authorities, which will improve our cash flows and reduce our
effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 and future years. The agreement provided a
retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
which was recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2006. The
Dutch tax agreement contributed $0.13 per diluted share to our results for the
second quarter.

     Also included in our second quarter results is an after-tax charge of
$18.8 million, or approximately $0.08 per diluted share, related to stock-
based compensation expense now recognized in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123R "Share-Based Payment" ("FAS
123R"), which we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our net
income for the quarter was negatively affected by higher demand creation
spending compared with low spending levels last year, when our spending was
heavily weighted to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 in support of the World
Cup.  Our earnings per share for the quarter grew at a higher rate than net
income given lower outstanding shares due to our share repurchase program.

</TABLE>

     On a consolidated basis, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
increased revenues by 1 percentage point for both the second quarter and first
six months of fiscal 2007.  Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to
drive revenue growth for the quarter and year-to-date period, as all four of
our geographic regions and all three of our product business units delivered
revenue growth.  Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, both the
U.S. region and our international regions each contributed 3 percentage points
to the consolidated revenue growth for the quarter and year-to-date periods.
Our Other businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan Holdings
Incorporated, Converse Inc., Exeter Brands Group LLC, Hurley International
LLC, NIKE Bauer Hockey, Inc., and NIKE Golf contributed the remaining 3
percentage points of the consolidated constant-currency revenue growth for
both the quarter and year-to-date period, as each business within the group
posted higher revenues.

     By product group, our worldwide apparel and equipment businesses were
particularly strong, each posting 11% growth for the second quarter; and
combined, added $140 million of incremental revenue.  Footwear grew 7%, and
contributed $115 million of incremental revenue for the quarter.  For the first
six months of fiscal 2007, our worldwide apparel and equipment businesses
contributed $278 million of incremental revenue, while footwear contributed
$212 million of incremental revenue.

</TABLE>

For the second quarter of fiscal 2007, gross margins remained relatively
consistent with the prior year period, reflecting a slight decrease in our
overall geographical region margins, partially offset by margin improvement in
our Other businesses. The primary factors contributing to the year-to-date
change in gross margin percentage were as follows:

     (1)  Lower footwear in-line net pricing margins due to:

          -   higher sales incentives, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and
              Africa ("EMEA") region;

          -   additional logistics costs incurred to meet strong footwear
              demand in the U.S. region; and

          -   overall higher product costs, primarily the result of higher
              labor costs;

          -   partially offset by cost reduction such as lean manufacturing and
              price increases on selected products.

     (2)  Higher gross margins for apparel, primarily during the second
          quarter, due to a shift in mix from lower margin apparel to higher
          margin apparel, combined with improved inventory management.

     (3)  Improved gross margins in our Other businesses driven primarily by
          NIKE Bauer Hockey and Converse, partially offset by the expected
          effects of the transition in Exeter's business model from licensing
          to wholesale.

    3 Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including
      costs of endorsement contracts.

</TABLE>

     Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased selling and
administrative expense by 1 percentage point for the second quarter and year-
to-date period versus the same periods in the prior year.  During the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal 2007, excluding stock-based
compensation, the increase in selling and administrative expenses, comprised of
demand creation (advertising and promotion) and operating overhead, was
primarily attributable to the timing of major advertising campaigns during
fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006.

     In the second quarter and year-to-date period, demand creation expense
increased 27% and 23%, respectively, versus the same periods in the prior year.
The growth in demand creation was driven by increased spending on advertising
and sports marketing events related to the NIKE Pro, LeBron, American Football
and NIKE+ campaigns during the second quarter, and increased spending around
the global World Cup and NIKE Air (registered) campaigns over the six-month
period.  Additionally, the timing of demand creation spending in fiscal 2006,
with a higher percentage of our spending occurring in the latter half of the
year around the World Cup, also contributed to the increases versus the
comparable prior year periods. For all of fiscal 2007, growth in demand
creation expense is expected to be more in line with our revenue growth.

     Excluding stock-based compensation expense, operating overhead increased
6% for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2007, a lower
rate of growth than revenue.  The increase in operating overhead was mainly
attributable to higher wages and benefits and increased spending to support
the growth of NIKE-owned retail, primarily related to the addition of new
factory outlet stores.

</TABLE>


     Other expense (income), net is comprised substantially of gains and
losses associated with the conversion of non-functional currency receivables
and payables, the re-measurement of derivative instruments, disposals of fixed
assets, as well as other unusual or non-recurring transactions that are
outside the normal course of business.  Such items did not have a significant
effect on Other expense (income), net for the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

     As disclosed in the first quarter, the decrease in Other expense
(income), net for the first six months of fiscal 2007 compared to the prior
year was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal
2007, compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006. The foreign
currency hedge losses recognized in the first six months of fiscal 2007 were
more than offset by the $14.2 million benefit from the final settlement of the
Converse arbitration during the first quarter. For our segment reporting,
foreign currency hedge gains and losses are reflected in the Corporate line of
pre-tax income and the Converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the
Other line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 9 - Operating

</TABLE>

     The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2%, an improvement
of nearly 8 percentage points versus the comparable period in the prior year.
During the second quarter, we finalized a tax agreement with the Dutch
government that is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015.  This
agreement resulted in a retroactive tax benefit related to fiscal 2006 and the
first quarter of fiscal 2007, which we recognized in our second quarter
results.  For the balance of fiscal 2007, we expect an effective tax rate of
approximately 33.5%, bringing our estimated full year rate to 32.5%.



    Futures Orders

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel,
scheduled for delivery from December 2006 through April 2007, were 7% higher
than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2006.  This
futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual
exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period,
which approximate current spot rates.  The net effect from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points to futures growth
versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, unit
sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in
overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders
growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth
during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between
advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as
well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause
differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual
revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from
futures and advance orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE
footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team
apparel, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey,
NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands.

</TABLE>

     For the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2007, the growth
in U.S. footwear revenue was the result of increases in both unit sales and
average selling price per pair. For both the quarter and year-to-date
period, unit sales growth and increases in average selling price per pair
were driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture, men's sports
performance, most notably running, and Brand Jordan products.

     The growth in U.S. apparel revenues for the second quarter and first
six months of fiscal 2007 was attributable to higher unit sales, primarily
NIKE brand sport performance apparel, as well as an improvement in average
selling prices, driven by team and licensed apparel and Brand Jordan
products.

     Second quarter pre-tax income for the U.S. region was consistent with the
comparable period in the prior year, and down slightly for the year-to-date
period, as higher selling and administrative expenses and lower gross margins
(resulting from additional logistics costs incurred to meet strong footwear
unit demand, higher footwear product costs and lower retail margins)
neutralized the growth in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses
increased for the quarter and first six months of the fiscal year as a result
of higher demand creation spending around the Lebron, American Football and
Nike+ campaigns, most notably during the second quarter, combined with
increased spend around the World Cup and Nike Air (registered) campaigns in
the first quarter.  The growth in demand creation spend versus the comparable
prior year periods is also a function of the difference in timing of major
advertising campaigns during fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006.

</TABLE>

     For the EMEA region, which includes Europe, Middle East and Africa,
3 percentage points of the revenue growth for both the second quarter and the
first six months of fiscal 2007 was due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets within the region,
with the exception of the U.K. and France, increased revenues during the
quarter and year-to-date period. The emerging markets in the region grew
approximately 30% for the quarter and year-to-date period driven by strong
results in Russia, South Africa and Turkey.  Increases in Italy and Spain also
contributed significantly to the revenue growth in both the second quarter and
year-to-date period. While the majority of markets in the region continued to
experience growth, the challenging retail environment in the U.K. and France
partially offset this growth.

     Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues decreased during
the second quarter and year-to-date periods of fiscal 2007 compared to the
same periods in the prior year, as a result of decreased unit sales,
partially offset by a slight increase in the average selling price per pair.
The unit sales decrease was due primarily to lower sales to certain
retailers and a challenging retail environment in the U.K. and France,
offset by increased demand for sport culture products across the rest of the
region.  The increase in the average selling price per pair was due in part
to changes in the mix of in-line products sold towards products with a
higher average selling price.

     The increase in EMEA apparel revenue during the second quarter and
first six months of 2007 was driven by increased unit sales and an increase
in average selling prices of NIKE brand apparel, primarily sport performance
products, including Nike Pro.

     The decline in EMEA pre-tax income for the second quarter and first six
months of fiscal 2007 reflected a lower gross margin percentage and higher
selling and administrative expenses, primarily demand creation, which more
than offset the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency
translation compared to prior year periods.  The lower gross margin
percentage for the quarter and year-to-date period was attributable to lower
in-line net pricing margins in footwear combined with an increase in
warehousing costs. The lower in-line net pricing margins in footwear were
attributable to higher product costs, which were primarily the result of
increased labor costs and higher sales incentives.

     Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, selling and
administrative expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2007
were higher than the corresponding periods in the prior year, driven
primarily by higher demand creation spending around the Nike Pro and Nike+
campaigns, most notably during the second quarter, combined with increased
spend around the World Cup and Nike Air (registered) campaigns over the six-
month period.  Operating overhead expense increased in both the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal 2007 due primarily to expected annual
increases in wages and benefits.

</TABLE>

     In the Asia Pacific region, changes in currency exchange rates did not
have a significant effect on year-over-year revenue growth for the second
quarter or the first six months of fiscal 2007. While the majority of
countries within the region reported double-digit sales increases for both the
quarter and year-to-date period, China and Korea were the primary drivers of
revenue growth, as revenues for each country grew more than 30% and 20%,
respectively, for both the quarter and year-to-date period. While revenue
growth in the Asia Pacific region was strong, revenue growth in Japan was up
just over 1% for the quarter and approximately 2% year-to-date, due to weak
market conditions.

     Footwear revenue growth for both the quarter and first six months of
fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China and Korea,
partially offset by lower average selling prices, which primarily resulted
from strategies to improve consumer value in Japan. The increase in apparel
revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date period was also primarily driven
by increased demand in China and Korea.

     The increase in pre-tax income in the second quarter and first six
months of fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross
margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset
higher selling and administrative expenses. The increase in selling and
administrative expenses during the second quarter was primarily attributable
to demand creation investments in the LeBron campaign, the Just Do It
campaign in China, the launch of Nike+ in Japan, and sports marketing across
the region, as well as increased spend around the World Cup during the first
quarter. Overall business growth across the region, combined with retail
expansion in China also contributed to an increase in operating overhead
expenses.  The gross margin improvement for the quarter and first six months
of the fiscal year was primarily driven by improved year-over-year hedge
rates, better inventory management and reduced warehousing costs.  The year-
to-date improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales
incentives combined with efforts to improve consumer value, most notably in
Japan.

</TABLE>

     In the Americas region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed
1 and 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the second quarter and first
six months of fiscal 2007, respectively.  Excluding the changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, sales increases in Argentina, Mexico and Chile
contributed to the revenue growth in both the second quarter and year-to-
date period.  Growth in these markets was partially offset by sales declines
in Brazil and Canada for both the second quarter and year-to-date period.

     The increase in pre-tax income for both the second quarter and first
six months was attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins,
combined with favorable foreign currency translation. These factors were
partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses for both the
quarter and year-to-date period. The increase in selling and administrative
expenses was primarily the result of higher demand creation spending around
the Run Americas II campaign during the second quarter and the global World
Cup in the year-to-date period. Operating overhead expense also increased
for the quarter and first six months of fiscal 2007, driven by increases in
wages and benefit costs.

     The increase in Other business revenues for the second quarter and
first six months of fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues across all
businesses, most notably Converse and NIKE Bauer Hockey.

     During the second quarter and year-to-date period, improved
profitability at Converse, driven by increased revenues in the U.S. and
internationally, and growth at NIKE Bauer Hockey contributed to the increase
in pre-tax income versus the same periods in the prior year.  As previously
discussed, the year-to-date results include the benefit from the favorable
settlement of the arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South
American licensee.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Activity

     Cash provided by operations was $541.6 million for the first six months
of fiscal 2007, compared to $738.2 million for the first six months of
fiscal 2006. Our primary source of operating cash flow for the first six
months of 2007 was net income of $702.8 million offset by an increased
investment in working capital to support growth in the business.  The
increased investment in working capital over the first six months of fiscal
2007 was largely due to an increase in taxes receivable resulting from the
Dutch Tax agreement and an increase in tax prepayments versus the same
period in the prior year.

     Cash provided by investing activities was $389.9 million for the first
six months of fiscal 2007, compared to cash used in investing activities of
$652.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2006.  The increase over
fiscal 2006 was primarily due to higher net maturities of short-term
investments (maturities net of purchases) as we liquidated short-term
investments for share repurchases.

     Cash used in financing activities was $803.7 million for the first six
months of fiscal 2007, compared to $352.2 million used in the first six
months of fiscal 2006.  The increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to
the $250 million repayment of corporate bonds, combined with an increase in
share repurchases, as discussed below.

     In the current quarter, we purchased 1.5 million shares of NIKE's Class
B common stock for $126.0 million, bringing total purchases for the first
six months of fiscal 2007 to 7.5 million shares at a cost of $602.7 million.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we repurchased 6 million shares, of
which 2 million shares completed the previous four-year, $1.5 billion share
repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. As of
the end the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we have now repurchased 5.5
million shares for $440.1 million under the new $3 billion program approved
by our Board of Directors in June 2006. We expect to fund share repurchases
from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the
amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock
market conditions.

     During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased our dividend per
common share 19% to $0.37, as compared to $0.31 in the second quarter of
fiscal 2006.

Contractual Obligations

     As a result of renewals of and additions to outstanding endorsement
contracts, the cash payments due under our endorsement contracts have
changed from what was previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
as of May 31, 2006.

Endorsement contract obligations as of November 30, 2006 are as follows:

</TABLE>

     The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate
amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are
obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual
payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these
contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon
athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods.
Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts
include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in
future periods.

     In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the
endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine
how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis, as the contracts
do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product, and
as a result, such amounts are not included in the table above. The amount of
product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including
general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they
participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing
initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase
the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time
and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for
products sold to customers.

Capital Resources

     On December 1, 2006, the Company entered into a new $1 billion multi-year
credit facility that replaces the Company's previous $750 million facility.
The new revolving credit facility has similar terms as the previous facility
and matures in December 2011, with a one year extension option prior to each
of the first anniversary and second anniversary of the closing date, for a
total extension of two years. No amounts were outstanding under these
facilities at May 31, 2006 or November 30, 2006.

     Our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings remain at A+ and A2 from
Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was no amount outstanding at November 30, 2006 or May 31, 2006. We
currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above and in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, will be
sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable
future.


Recently Issued Accounting Standards

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The provisions of FIN 48 are effective
for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the
impact of the provisions of FIN 48.

     In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 06-2, "Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other
Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43." ("EITF 06-2").EITF 06-2
clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees' rights to
compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement.
The provisions of EITF 06-2 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June
1, 2007 and will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
earnings.  We have evaluated the provisions of EITF 06-2 and do not expect
that the adoption will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The
provisions of FAS 157 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1,
2008.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. "Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("FAS 158").
FAS 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated
with single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other
postretirement plans in their financial statements.  The provisions of FAS
158 are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. We
have evaluated the provisions of FAS 158 and do not expect that the adoption
will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

     In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB 108").  SAB 108
requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and
income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement as material, when all relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered.  The guidance in SAB 108 is effective for
the fiscal year ending May 31, 2007.  We are currently evaluating the
impact of SAB 108.

Critical Accounting Policies


     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in
the accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on
our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. With the adoption of FAS 123R at the beginning of the first
quarter of fiscal 2007, we have added "Stock-based Compensation" as a
critical accounting policy as described below.  Actual results could differ
from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent
payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make
estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date.
However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results
related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period
following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally
affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.

     Stock-based Compensation

     As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R,
the fair value of stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes fair value model. The Black-Scholes option pricing
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in
market traded options on the Company's common stock, with a term greater than
one year.  Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the
availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment
that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends
than historical volatility.  If factors change and we use different
assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods,
stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that
recorded in the current period.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2006.

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

     The Company carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial
Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2006.

     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.


               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                             and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
