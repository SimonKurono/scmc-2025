         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the six (6) months ended November 30, 2003 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2004 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 3 - Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill:
         ___________________________________________

     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," (FAS 142) effective June 1, 2002.  In
accordance with FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
will no longer be amortized but instead will be measured for impairment
annually in the fourth quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment
exists.  Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

     The following table summarizes the Company's identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill balances as of November 30, 2003 and May 31, 2003:

NOTE 5 - Stock-Based Compensation:
         _________________________

     The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" as permitted by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (FAS 123). The Company's policy is to grant stock options with
an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of grant, and
accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized.

     If the Company had accounted for stock options issued to employees in
accordance with FAS 123, the Company's pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share would have been reported as follows:

     The pro forma effects of applying FAS 123 may not be representative of
the effects on reported net income and earnings per share for future periods

year.

NOTE 6 - Earnings Per Common Share:
         _________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase 1.0 million and 12.0
million shares of common stock were outstanding at November 30, 2003 and
November 30, 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the
effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 7 - Acquisition:
         ___________

     On September 4, 2003, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity
shares of Converse Inc. ("Converse").  Converse designs, distributes, and
markets high performance and casual athletic footwear and apparel.  The
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations".  The cash purchase
price, including acquisition costs, was approximately $310 million.  The
results of Converse's operations have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition as part of the Company's
Other operating segment.

     All assets and liabilities of Converse have been recorded in the Company's
consolidated balance sheet based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill relating to the
purchase approximated $254.8 and $66.7 million, respectively.  Identifiable
intangible assets include $246.2 million for trademarks that have an indefinite
life, and $8.6 million of other intangible assets that are being amortized over
nine months.  Deferred taxes of $105.1 million have been provided for the
purchase of the identifiable intangible assets, which is the primary reason for
goodwill.  The pro forma effect of the acquisition on the combined results of
operations was not significant.


NOTE 8 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions with operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity.  Each NIKE
brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:  the design,
production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and
equipment. The "Other" category shown below represents activities of Cole Haan
Holdings, Inc., Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE
Golf and Converse Inc., beginning September 4, 2003, which are considered
immaterial for individual disclosure.

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations. Effective June 1, 2003 the assets,
liabilities, and operating expenses of NIKE IHM, Inc., which primarily
manufactures NIKE Air components, have been reclassified to the Corporate
category from Other, reflecting current management of these operations.  NIKE
IHM, Inc. information for the applicable prior year period has been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of
accounting change as shown in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Income.  Reconciling items for pre-tax income represent corporate costs
that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting
including certain currency exchange rate gains and losses on transactions
and intercompany eliminations for specific items in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment for
operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided below:

NOTE 9 - Commitments and Contingencies:
         _____________________________

     At November 30, 2003, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling $479.7 million.  These letters of credit were issued primarily for
the purchase of inventory.

     There have been no other significant subsequent developments
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the
Company's most recent Form 10-K.


Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies
_________________________

     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the
accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial
statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.
Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could
differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments
under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in
the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since
our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these
estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the
financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the
timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.


Operating Results
_________________

Consolidated Operating Results

     -   Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $2.8 billion, a 13%
         increase versus the second quarter of fiscal 2003.  Revenue for the
         first six months of fiscal 2004 was $5.9 billion, up 10% versus the
         same period of fiscal 2003.

     -   Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was 42.3% of
         revenues, up from 40.2% for the second quarter of the prior year.
         Gross margin for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was 42.7%, up
         from 40.8% for the first six months of the prior year.

     -   Selling and administrative expense for the second quarter of fiscal
         2004 increased 18% versus the second quarter of the prior year, to
         $902.5 million, and was 31.8% as a percentage of revenues versus
         30.3% for the second quarter of the prior year.  Selling and
         administrative expense for the first six months of fiscal 2004
         increased 13% versus the first six months of the prior year, and was
         30.2% as a percentage of revenues versus 29.5% for the first six
         months of the prior year.

     -   Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $179.1 million,
         an 18% increase versus the second quarter of fiscal 2003.  Net income
         for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was $440.3 million, up 19%
         versus the first six months of the prior year before the cumulative
         effect of accounting change in the first quarter of the prior year.
         Net income for the first six months of the prior year after the
         cumulative effect of the accounting change was $103.1 million.

     -   Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were
         $0.66, up 16% versus the second quarter of the prior year.  Diluted
         earnings per share for the first six months of fiscal 2004 were
         $1.64, a 19% increase before the cumulative effect of an accounting
         change in the first quarter of the prior year.  Diluted earnings per
         share for the first six months of the prior year after the cumulative
         effect of the accounting change were $0.39.

     Revenue from our international regions increased 12% for the second
quarter and 13% for the first six months of fiscal 2004 which contributed 6
percentage points and 7 percentage points of growth, respectively, to
consolidated revenue.  All of the second quarter growth and all but one
percentage point of the six month growth from our international regions can be
attributable to changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the euro.

     As previously disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended November 30, 2002, in the prior year we accelerated
approximately $66 million of deliveries from the third quarter to the second
quarter as we prepared to implement new supply chain systems in our Europe,
Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Region.  This shift in the timing of shipments
in the prior year reduced international revenue growth comparisons for the
second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004 by 6 percentage points and
3 percentage points, respectively; the impact on consolidated revenue growth
was 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point, respectively.

     The acquisition of Converse during the quarter contributed 2 percentage
points of consolidated revenue growth in the second quarter and one percentage
point of growth for the first six months of fiscal 2004.  See Note 7 -
Acquisitions for additional information related to the acquisition.  Revenue
growth in the U.S. Region contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated
revenue growth in the second quarter and 40 basis points (0.40 percentage
points) of growth for the first six months of fiscal 2004.  The remaining
increase in consolidated revenue is due to growth in our Other segment, in
addition to that of Converse as noted above.  See further discussion of
revenues in Operating Segments below.

     In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, our consolidated gross margin
percentage improved 210 basis points versus the prior year, from 40.2% to
42.3%. For the first six months of fiscal 2004, our consolidated gross margin
percentage improved 190 basis points compared to the first six months of the
prior year, from 40.8% to 42.7%. The primary factors contributing to the
improved gross margin percentages for the second quarter and year-to-date
periods were as follows:

       (1)  A reduced level of closeout sales as a percentage of total sales,
            improved margins on those closeout sales, and an improved mix of
            product in inventory, primarily in the U.S. and EMEA regions.
            These factors represent approximately 90 basis points of
            improvement for the quarter, and 70 basis points of improvement
            for the year-to-date period.

       (2)  Higher pricing margins for in-line products (i.e. current product
            offerings), due to lower air freight, lower product costs from
            manufacturing efficiencies and reduced material costs, and a
            higher mix of sales of classic footwear models.  These factors
            represent approximately 60 basis points of improvement for the
            quarter and 40 basis points of improvement year-to-date.

       (3)  Changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, represent
            30 basis points and 40 basis points of improvement for the quarter
            and year-to-date periods, respectively.

     Second quarter selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand
creation and operating overhead, grew 18% versus the prior year quarter.
Year-to-date fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expense increased 13% over
the prior year period. Demand creation expense grew 25% to $340.6 million in
the second quarter of fiscal 2004 while year-to-date demand creation expense
increased 12% to $664.7 million.  Seven percentage points of the increase for
the second quarter and 6 percentage points of the year-to-date increase were
due to changes in currency exchange rates.  Excluding the impact of currency,
the increase in demand creation spending for the second quarter is
attributable to higher spending for advertising primarily in the U.S., EMEA,
and Asia Pacific regions (8 percentage point impact) and higher spending on
endorsement contracts primarily related to basketball in the U.S. and soccer
in EMEA (5 percentage point impact). The addition of Converse also had a 3
percentage point impact on demand creation for the quarter.  The overall
increase in demand creation for the year-to-date period was due to the second
quarter factors as explained above.

     Operating overhead for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $561.9
million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2003.  For the first
six months of fiscal 2004, operating overhead increased 14% to $1,107.4
million. Currency exchange rates contributed 4 percentage points of the
increase for the second quarter, and 5 percentage points of the increase for
the first six months.  The addition of Converse accounted for 3 percentage
points of growth for the second quarter and 2 points of growth year-to-date.
Excluding the effects of currency and Converse, operating overhead increases
for the quarter were mainly attributable to: a) higher net bad debt expense (3
percentage points); b) increased costs to support the growth of our NIKE Golf,
Cole Haan, Bauer NIKE Hockey and Hurley businesses (2 percentage points); and
c) normal wage increases and some added infrastructure, including costs around
our worldwide supply chain initiative, necessary to support the global
business growth. The overall increase in operating overhead for the year-to-
date period was consistent with those of the quarter.

     Other expense, net, was $14.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal
2004 compared to $11.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003.  Other
expense, net, for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was $38.1 million
compared to $22.5 million for the same period of fiscal 2003.  Beginning this
fiscal year, interest income and profit sharing expense previously included in
other expense, net, are included in interest expense, net, and selling and
administrative, respectively. The presentation of prior year amounts has been
adjusted to conform to the current classification. The most significant
component of other expense, net, comprising approximately 45% of this year's
quarterly and year-to-date net expense, is foreign currency losses primarily
hedge losses on intercompany charges to a European subsidiary, whose
functional currency is the euro. These losses are reflected in the Corporate
line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in Note 8 - Operating
Segments. The hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened
considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts.

     In the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2004, net
foreign currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by
favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most
significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the
favorable translation is a $30 million addition to consolidated income before
income taxes compared to the prior year second quarter and $64 million
compared to the first six months of the prior year.  Consistent with our
existing policies, we have also hedged a portion of anticipated intercompany
charges for the balance of fiscal 2004. As the euro has strengthened since
these hedge contracts were executed, we expect to continue to incur some hedge
losses for the balance of fiscal 2004. However, at current exchange rates, we
expect the net impact of the hedge losses and the offsetting positive
translation impact will result in a net benefit to fiscal 2004 consolidated
net income versus the prior year.

     Our effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was 34.8%,
relatively consistent with the first six months of fiscal 2003 rate of 34.5%,
but higher than the full year rate for fiscal 2003 of 34.1%.  This increase
compared to fiscal 2003 anticipates higher taxes on foreign earnings.

     Included in net income for the first six months of fiscal 2003 was a
$266.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
(FAS 142). This charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks
associated with Bauer NIKE Hockey and the goodwill of Cole Haan, reflecting
that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying
values. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 4 -
Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
as of May 31, 2003 for further information.

Operating Segments

     Our largest international region, EMEA, reported 9% revenue growth for
the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and 13% revenue
growth in the first six months of fiscal 2004. All business units experienced
growth in revenues for the quarter and six-month periods. The second quarter
growth reflected a 15 percentage point improvement and the year-to-date period
reflected a 17 percentage point improvement due to changes in currency
exchange rates. As discussed above, in the prior year we accelerated
approximately $66 million of deliveries into the second quarter from the third
quarter in advance of implementing new supply chain systems in Europe.  This
shift reduced comparable revenue growth for the quarter by 9 percentage points
and by 4 percentage points for the year-to-date period. If we remove the
effects of currency and shipment timing in the prior year, fiscal 2004 revenue
for the EMEA Region would have grown approximately three percent in the second
quarter, primarily due to increased footwear volume, and would have been flat
for the first six months.

     EMEA pre-tax income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $139.4
million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter.  For the first six months of
fiscal 2004, pretax income grew 20% to $344.0 million. For the quarter and the
six month periods, higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the
increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs.
The improved gross margins were primarily the result of a lower level of
closeout sales and higher closeout margins, and changes in currency exchange
rates.  See further discussion regarding gross margins and selling and
administrative costs in Consolidated Operating Results.

     In the Asia Pacific Region, revenues increased 18% year-over-year in the
second quarter of fiscal 2004 and increased 16% year-over-year in the first
six months of fiscal 2004.  Five percentage points of growth for both the
second quarter and the first six months were due to changes in currency
exchange rates. Excluding the currency benefit, sales in each Asia Pacific
business unit grew for both the quarter and year-to-date periods.  The
region's revenue growth was primarily attributed to volume increases.
Significant revenue increases in China and Korea, driven by expansion of
retail distribution and strong consumer demand, as well as continued growth in
Japan were key growth drivers for the quarter and year-to-date periods.

     Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region increased to $98.7 million in
the second quarter of fiscal 2004, up from $83.9 million in the second quarter
of fiscal 2003, and increased from $134.6 million to $175.5 million in the
fiscal 2004 year-to-date period. For the quarter, higher revenues and gross
margin improvements drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental
selling and administrative costs. The higher gross margins were attributable
to improved in-line margins across footwear, apparel and equipment.  For the
six-month period, gross margins improved, while selling and administrative
spending declined as a percent of revenue as a result of lower demand creation
expenses versus the prior year investment in marketing the 2002 World Cup.
See further discussion regarding gross margins and selling and administrative
costs in Consolidated Operating Results.

     In the Americas Region, revenues increased 17% for the second quarter of
fiscal 2004, with 8 percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency
exchange rates, while the year-to-date fiscal 2004 revenues increased 12% with
5 percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Excluding the currency effects, the revenue growth for the quarter and year-
to-date periods was driven by stronger consumer demand in South and Central
America. Sales in Mexico were up slightly, but sales were down in Canada due
to lower consumer demand. Excluding the currency exchange rate impact, the
region experienced sales growth for the quarter and year-to-date periods for
footwear and equipment, slightly offset by a small decrease in apparel.

     In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, pre-tax income for the Americas
Region increased 10% from the prior year quarter, to $31.4 million.  Year-to-
date fiscal 2004 pre-tax income increased 4% to $55.7 million. The increase in
pre-tax income was attributable to higher revenues partially offset by reduced
gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs.  The reduced gross
margins are due to less favorable wholesale pricing in Mexico and less
favorable currency rates on product purchases in Mexico and Brazil.  See
further discussion regarding selling and administrative costs in Consolidated
Operating Results.

     In the U.S. Region, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 grew
5% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and revenues for the first six
months of fiscal 2004 grew 1% versus the year-ago period. In the second
quarter, footwear revenue increased 5% and apparel revenue increased 8%, while
equipment revenue was down 6%.  For the first six months of fiscal 2004,
footwear revenue was down 1% and equipment revenue was down 5%, while apparel
revenue increased 7%.  The increase in apparel sales for the second quarter
and six month periods was primarily driven by increased consumer demand for
team licensed apparel.

     The increase in footwear revenue for the quarter was due to approximately
a 4 percentage point increase in average wholesale selling price, as the sales
of $100 and over (suggested retail price) product grew and closeout product
sales declined compared to the prior year second quarter.  Growth in NIKE
retail volume also contributed to the overall footwear improvement in the
quarter. The year-to-date fiscal 2004 decline in footwear revenue of 1% was
primarily due to a decrease in wholesale volume resulting from the impact of
our redistribution strategy, which included reduced orders from our largest
customer (Foot Locker) and reduced premium product offerings to them.  These
redistribution changes were previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form
10-K as of May 31, 2003.  The reduction in footwear sales to Foot Locker was
partially offset by growth in sales to other wholesale customers and increased
sales through NIKE-owned retail stores.

     During the quarter, the company announced plans to execute joint
marketing programs with Foot Locker to develop innovative retail presentations
of NIKE performance products at select Foot Locker locations in the U.S.
beginning with the Fall 2004 season.  As part of those programs, additional
premium product offerings will be available to select Foot Locker locations
beginning May 2004.  As these plans are executed, we expect our footwear sales
with Foot Locker to increase.  However, since our total revenue is derived
from sales to many customers, growth in sales to Foot Locker may not translate
directly to growth in overall footwear revenue.  See further information
regarding worldwide futures and advance orders below.

     For the second quarter, U.S. Region pre-tax income was $193.4 million, a
12% increase versus the second quarter of fiscal 2003.  Pre-tax income for the
first six months of fiscal 2004 increased 7% to $489.0 million. For the
quarter and year-to-date periods, higher revenues and gross margins drove the
increase, more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs. The
improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher in-line product
margins, including reduced air freight, and improved margins on closeout
sales. See further discussion regarding gross margins and selling and
administrative costs in Consolidated Operating Results.

     Other revenues and pre-tax income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004
include results from Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Cole Haan Holdings, Inc.,
Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE Golf.  Other revenues grew
54% in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and grew 43%
in the first six months of fiscal 2004 versus the prior year period.  The
addition of Converse contributed 28 percentage points of the increase for the
quarter and 15 percentage points of the increase for the first six months.
The remaining increase is due to growth in each of the other businesses, most
significantly NIKE Golf and Cole Haan.

     Other pre-tax income improved to $7.3 million in the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 from $0.5 million in fiscal 2003 and improved to $4.1 million in
the year-to-date fiscal 2004 period from a loss of $10.8 million in the same
period of last year.  The addition of Converse combined with improved results
from NIKE Golf and Cole Haan drove the year-over-year improvement.

     The previous discussion includes disclosure of "pre-tax income" for our
operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating
segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." As
discussed in Note 8 - Operating Segments in the attached Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax
income of our operating segments.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from December 2003 through April 2004 were 9.7% higher
than such orders reported in the comparable period of fiscal 2003. Four points
of this reported increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates
versus the same period last year. As always, the reported futures orders
growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth
during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between
advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as
well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the
comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a
significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders,
including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Bauer NIKE
Hockey, Cole Haan, Converse, NIKE Golf, Hurley, and retail sales across all
brands.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
____________________________


Cash Flow Activity

     Cash provided by operations was $769.1 million in the first six months of
fiscal 2004, compared to $400.0 million in the first six months of fiscal
2003. Our primary source of operating cash flow in the current period was net
income of $440.3 million.  In addition to the improvement in net income, the
year-over-year increase in cash provided by operations was attributable to
changes in our investment in working capital.  In the first six months of
fiscal 2003, our net investment in working capital increased partially due to
increased accounts receivable resulting from the accelerated shipping in
EMEA as previously discussed.  In the first six months of fiscal 2004, our net
investment in working capital improved due to a reduction in accounts
receivable resulting from improved account management combined with more
normal shipping patterns.

     Total cash used by investing activities during the first six months of
fiscal 2004 was $383.7 million, compared to $107.6 million in the prior year
period. The acquisition of Converse represents the most significant use of cash
during the period.  The remaining investing activities are consistent with the
prior year and primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and
software to support both normal business operations as well as our supply chain
systems upgrade, continued investment in NIKE-owned retail stores, and selected
warehouse improvements.

     During the first six months of fiscal 2004, the principal uses of cash
for financing activities were share repurchases and dividends, partially
offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. These financing
activities were higher than the prior year partially due to an increase in the
market price of the company stock, which increased stock option exercises and
provided additional cash flows to be utilized in the share repurchase program.

     The share repurchases were part of a $1 billion share repurchase program
that began in fiscal 2001.  In the current quarter, we purchased approximately
1.6 million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $100.5 million, bringing
purchases for the first six months of fiscal 2004 to 3.3 million shares for
$190.0 million.  To date under the program, we have purchased 15.6 million
shares for $775.7 million. We expect to continue to fund this program from
operating cash flow. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be
dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.

     As a result of the above, our cash balance increased by $334.9 million
during the first six months of fiscal 2004.


Long-term Financial Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

     As a result of modifications and additions to outstanding endorsement
contracts and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on such
obligations, the cash payments due under our endorsement contracts have
changed from what was previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
as of May 31, 2003.

     Significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of
this report are as follows:

</TABLE>

     The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts
of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to
pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under
some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide
for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or
royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some
contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions
for reduced payments if athlete performance declines in future periods.

     There has not been a material change to any of our other long-term
contractual obligations from what was previously reported in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K as of May 31, 2003.

Capital Resources

     In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the
securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which $1.0 billion in debt
securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program
under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500.0 million in
medium-term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program
to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general
corporate cash requirements.  During the second quarter, we issued three notes
under the medium-term note program totaling $100 million. Two of the notes
totaling $50 million have fixed interest rates of 5.15% and mature on October
15, 2015. The other $50 million note has an interest coupon rate of 4.70% and
matures on October 1, 2013. For each of the 5.15% notes maturing October 15,
2015, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive
fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest
payments based on the six-month London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus a
spread. The swaps have the same notional amounts and maturity dates as the
notes, and are accounted for as fair value hedges under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 133. For the 4.70% note maturing October 1, 2013
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we receive fixed
interest payments at the same rate as the note and pay variable interest
payments based on the six-month LIBOR plus a spread for a term of three years.
This swap has the same notional amount as the note, but expires October 2,
2006.  Accordingly, the swap does not qualify for fair value hedge accounting,
so changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each
period.  After issuance of these notes, $310.0 million remains available to be
issued under our medium-term note program, and another $500.0 million remains
available to be issued under our shelf registration statement. We may issue
additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2004 depending on
general corporate needs.

     On November 20, 2003 we put in place a new 5-year $750 million revolving
credit facility with a group of banks.  The maturity date is November 20, 2008
and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary
date. We currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. Our previous
credit facility totaled $1 billion, and was made up of a $500 million 364 day
facility and a $500 million multi-year facility.  Based on our current long-
term senior unsecured debt ratings of A and A2 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate
charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.22%.
The facility fee is 0.08% of the total commitment.

     If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and
interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely,
if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest
rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger
acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future
borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under this committed credit
facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits
on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may
incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any
borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant, and
were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings
would become immediately due and payable. As of November 30, 2003, we were in
full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will
fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was no amount outstanding at November 30, 2003 or May 31, 2003. We
currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to
meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock for the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 were $0.20 per share, which reflected a $0.06 increase compared to
the previous quarterly dividend.


Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2003.


Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

     The Company carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer, to
evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2003. Based on the
foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level.

     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.


               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                             and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.


                           Part II - Other Information

Item 1.

Legal Proceedings

     In October 2003, the Multnomah County Circuit Court for the State of
Oregon entered a stipulation dismissing with prejudice the shareholder
derivative lawsuit, Metivier v. DeNunzio, et al., 0104-04339, pursuant to a
settlement agreement.  As part of the settlement, we agreed to pay $400,000 to
plaintiffs for attorney fees.  Also as part of the settlement, another related
shareholder derivative lawsuit, Lendman v. Knight, et al., CV-01-1153-AS, in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, was dismissed with
prejudice (which means the plaintiff cannot refile the action).

     There have been no other significant developments from the information
previously reported under Item 4 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003.

elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of a Floating Rate Advance,
or as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of
a Eurodollar Ratable Advance, to convert such Advance into an Advance
bearing interest based on another Rate Option; or (ii) elect, as of
the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to continue a
Eurodollar Ratable Advance or Floating Rate Advance having an Interest
Period expiring on such day; except, that during the existence of a
Default or Unmatured Default, the Borrower may not elect to have any
Advance converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Ratable Advance
unless the Majority Banks consent thereto.  All conversions and
continuations of Advances shall be made ratably according to the
respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to
which the notice was given held by each Bank.

          (b)   The Borrower shall deliver a notice of
conversion/continuation in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (a

          (c)   If upon the expiration of any Interest Period
applicable to a Eurodollar Ratable Advance, the Borrower has failed to
select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Advance,
or if any Default or Unmatured Default then exists, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have elected to convert such Advance into a Floating Rate
Advance effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same
Competitive Bid Quote Request.  Any such subsequent Competitive Bid
Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such
subsequent Competitive Bid Quote specifically states that it is
submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive
Bid Quote.  The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall
specify the aggregate principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for

reasonable prior notice to the Banks, such other time and date as the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree), the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or rejection of the
offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.3.5; provided, however,
                                                    ________  _______
that the failure by the Borrower to give such notice to the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection of all such
offers.  In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Competitive Bid
                                                    _______________
Borrowing Notice") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of
________________
offers for each Interest Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may
accept any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part (subject to the

two or more Banks with the same Eurodollar Bid Rates or Absolute Rates,
as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the
amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related Interest
Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of
which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative
Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in such multiples, not
less than $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate)
in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers;
provided, however, that no Bank shall be allocated a portion of any
Competitive Bid Advance which is less than the minimum amount which
such Bank has indicated that it is willing to accept.  Allocations by
the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative
Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the same Business Day, notify
each Bank of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the
aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance allocated to

             (b)     Calculation of Facility Fees.  The facility fees
                     ____________________________
shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in
the Applicable Facility Fee Rate during any quarter, the actual daily
amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Facility Fee
Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such
Applicable Facility Fee Rate was in effect.  The facility fees shall
accrue at all times, including at any time during which one or more of
the conditions in Article IV is not met.
                  __________

     2.4.4.  Utilization Fee.
             _______________

             (a)     Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the
                     ____
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank in accordance with
its pro rata share of the Commitments, a utilization fee equal to the
Applicable Utilization Fee Rate times the actual daily aggregate
outstanding Loans on each day that the aggregate outstanding amount of
the Loans equals or exceeds 33.0% of the Commitments (without giving
effect to any reduction in Commitments due to outstanding Competitive
Bid Loans).  The utilization fee shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first Payment Date to
occur after the Effective Date, and on the Termination Date.

             (b)     Calculation of Utilization Fee.  The utilization
                     ______________________________
fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears.  The utilization fee
shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which one or
more of the conditions in Article IV is not met.
                          __________

     2.4.5.  Banks' Participation Fee.  On the Effective Date, the
             ________________________
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Banks in accordance with their respective pro rata shares, a
participation fee in an amount set forth in the Fee Letter.  Such
participation fees are for the credit facility committed to by the
Banks under this Agreement and are fully earned on the date paid.  The
participation fee paid to each Bank is solely for its own account and
is nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever.

     2.4.6.  Computation of Fees.  Computation of all fees shall be
             ___________________
calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to the payee thereof than
a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days.

     2.5.    General Facility Terms.
             ______________________

     2.5.1.  Method of Borrowing.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. (San
             ___________________
Francisco time) on each Borrowing Date, each Bank shall make available
its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available to the Administrative
Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office.  Unless otherwise
instructed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall deposit the
funds so received from the Banks in the Borrower's account at Bank of
America's main office in San Francisco.

     2.5.2.  Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Ratable Advance, and
             ______________________________
each conversion and continuation with respect to a Ratable Advance,
shall be in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral
multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof); provided, however, that
any Floating Rate Advance may be in the aggregate amount of the unused
Commitments.

     2.5.3.  Repayment.  Except for optional payments pursuant to
             _________
Section 2.5.4, (a) each Competitive Bid Advance shall be paid in full
by the Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, and (b) each Ratable Advance shall be paid in full by the
Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
unless such Ratable Advance is converted or continued in accordance
with Section 2.2.4; but in any event all Advances shall be paid in full
on the Termination Date.

     2.5.4.  Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may, upon
             ___________________________
notice to the Administrative Agent, from time to time pay all
outstanding Ratable Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof), any
portion of the outstanding Ratable Advances provided that such notice
must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
(San Francisco time) (i) three Business Days' prior to any date of
prepayment with respect to Eurodollar Ratable Advances and (ii) on the
date of prepayment with respect to Floating Rate Advances.  All such
payments shall be made in immediately available funds to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office by 11:00 a.m.
(San Francisco time) on the date of payment.  A Competitive Bid Advance
may not be prepaid prior to the last day of its applicable Interest
Period without the prior consent of the Bank which originally made such
Loan, which consent may be given or withheld at the Bank's sole and
absolute discretion.  Any prepayment of a Fixed Rate Advance prior to
the end of an applicable Interest Period shall be subject to the
indemnification provided in Section 3.4.

     2.5.5.  Interest Periods.  Subject to the provisions of Section
             ________________
2.5.6, each Advance shall bear interest (i) with respect to any
Floating Rate Advance, on the outstanding principal amount from the
applicable borrowing date until payment in full, and (ii) with respect
to any other Advance, from the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to the earlier of (a) the last day of such Interest
Period, or (b) the date of any earlier prepayment as permitted by
Section 2.5.4, at the interest rate determined as applicable to such
Advance, subject to the Borrower's right to convert or continue Ratable
Advances pursuant to Section 2.2.4.  The Borrower shall not request a
Fixed Rate Advance if, after giving effect to the requested Fixed Rate
Advance, more than 20 separate Fixed Rate Advances would be
outstanding.

     2.5.6.  Rate after Maturity.  Except as provided in the next
             ___________________
sentence, any Advance not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or
otherwise, shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate plus 1% per annum.  In the case of a Fixed Rate
Advance the maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance
shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest
Period, at the higher of (a) the rate otherwise applicable to such
Interest Period plus 1% per annum, or (b) the Base Rate plus 1% per
annum.

     2.5.7.  Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis.  Interest accrued
             ______________________________________
on each (i) Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date
and (ii) other Advance shall be payable on the last day of its
applicable Interest Period, and on any date on which such Advance is
prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise.  Interest accrued on
each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three
months shall also be payable on the last day of each three?month
interval during such Interest Period.  Interest on all Floating Rate
Advances calculated on the basis of the Base Rate shall be calculated
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the
actual number of days elapsed.  Interest on all other Advances shall be
calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year
of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a
higher yield to the payee thereof than a method based on a year of 365
or 366 days.  Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made
but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is
received prior to 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) at the place of
payment.  If any payment of principal or interest on an Advance shall
become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in
computing interest in connection with such payment.

     2.5.8.  Method of Payment.  All payments to be made by the
             _________________
Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, without prejudice to
Borrower's right to later assert any counterclaim, defense, recoupment
or setoff.  Except as specifically provided in this Agreement and in
the following sentence, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be
made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective
Banks to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than
11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the date when due and shall be
applied (i) first, ratably among the Banks with respect to any
            _____
principal and interest due in connection with Ratable Advances, (ii)
second, after all amounts described in clause (i) have been satisfied,
______
ratably among those Banks for whom any payment of principal and
interest is due in connection with any Competitive Bid Advances, and
(iii) third, after all amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii) have
      _____
been satisfied, ratably to any other Obligations then due to the Banks.
If such payment is received by the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m.
(San Francisco time) such delivery to the Banks shall be made on the
same day and if received thereafter shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized
to charge the account of the Borrower held at Bank of America for each
payment of principal, interest and fees owing by the Borrower as it
becomes due hereunder.

     2.5.9.  Notes; Telephonic Notices; Designation of Borrower.  Each
             __________________________________________________
Bank is hereby authorized to record on the schedule attached to each of
its Notes, or otherwise record in accordance with its usual practice,
the date and amount of each of its Loans of the type evidenced by such
Note; provided, however, that any failure to so record shall not affect
      ________  _______
the Borrower's Obligations under this Agreement or any Note.  The
Borrower hereby authorizes the Banks and the Administrative Agent to
extend, continue and convert Advances, effect Rate Option selections
and submit Competitive Bid Quotes based on telephonic notices made by
any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Bank in good
faith believes to be an authorized officer or an officer, employee or
agent of the Borrower designated by an authorized officer.  The
Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a
written or telecopy confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an
authorized officer.  If the written or telecopy confirmation differs in
any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent
and the Banks, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Banks
shall govern absent manifest error.

     2.5.10. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments.
             ________________________________________________________
The Administrative Agent will notify each Bank of the contents of each
Ratable Borrowing Notice, Notice of Conversion/Continuation (or
automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 2.2.4(c)), and payment
notice received by it hereunder promptly and in any event (provided
such items were timely received by the Administrative Agent from the
Borrower) before the close of business on the same Business Day of
receipt thereof (or, in the case of borrowing notices with respect to
Floating Rate Advances, within one hour of receipt thereof).  The
Administrative Agent will notify each Bank of the interest rate
applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of
such interest rate and will give each Bank prompt notice of each change
in the Base Rate in respect of any outstanding Floating Rate Advance.

     2.5.11. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless
             ________________________________________________
the Borrower or any Bank has notified the Administrative Agent, prior
to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the
Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Bank, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Borrower or such Bank, as the case may be, has timely
made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in
reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person
entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in
fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds,
then:

            (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
Bank shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Bank in
immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect
of each day from and including the date such amount was made available
by the Administrative Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is
repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at
the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

             (ii)    if any Bank failed to make such payment, such Bank
shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount
thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon
for the period from the date such amount was made available by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
effect. If such Bank pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then
such amount shall constitute such Bank's Ratable Loan or Competitive
Bid Loan, as the case may be, included in the applicable Borrowing.  If
such Bank does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative
Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand
therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to
the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the
Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest
applicable to the applicable Borrowing.  Nothing herein shall be deemed
to relieve any Bank from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to
prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may
have against any Bank as a result of any default by such Bank
hereunder.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Bank or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.5.11 shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.

     2.5.12. Cancellation.  The Borrower may, at any time after the
             ____________
Effective Date, upon not less than five Business Days' prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate or permanently reduce the
Commitments in whole, or in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000
(and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); unless,
                                                             ______
after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Loans made on the
effective date thereof, the then-outstanding principal amount of the
Loans would exceed the amount of the combined Commitments then in
effect.  All accrued commitment fees to, but not including, the
effective date of any reduction or termination of Commitments shall be
paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.  Once the
Commitments are reduced in accordance with this Section, they may not
be increased.

     2.5.13. Lending Offices.  Each Bank may from time to time, by
             _______________
written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, change its Lending Office and for whose account Loan payments
are to be made.

                             ARTICLE III
                    TAXES, CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
                    ______________________________

     3.1.    Taxes.
             _____

            (a)     Any and all payments by the Borrower to each Bank
or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for, any Taxes.  In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay
all Other Taxes.

            (b)     If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct
or withhold any Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank or the Administrative Agent,
then:

                    (i)     the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that, after making all required deductions and
withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section), such Bank or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives and retains an
amount equal to the sum it would have received and retained had no such
deductions or withholdings been made;

                    (ii)    the Borrower shall make such deductions and
withholdings;

                    (iii)   the Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable Law; and

                    (iv)    the Borrower shall also pay to each Bank or
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, at the time
interest is paid, Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank
specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would
have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been
imposed.

            (c)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of (i)
Taxes, (ii) Other Taxes, and (iii) Further Taxes in the amount that the
respective Bank specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield
the Bank would have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further
Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability (including penalties,
interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further
Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.  Payment under this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Bank or
the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.

            (d)     Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the
Borrower of Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Borrower shall
furnish to each Bank or the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other
evidence of payment satisfactory to such Bank or the Administrative
Agent.

     3.2.    Yield Protection.  If, after the date hereof, because of
             ________________
the enactment of, or any change in, any Law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive
(whether or not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof
(other than such enactments or changes that are not effective as of
August 31, 2003 but are scheduled to become effective thereafter
pursuant to such laws, rules, regulations, policies, guidelines,
directives or interpretations that are effective as of August 31,
2003), which

            (a)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any
reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
credit extended by, any Bank (other than reserves and assessments taken
into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate
Advances), or

            (b)     imposes any other condition the result of which is
to increase the cost to any Bank of making, funding or maintaining
loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Bank in connection with
loans, or requires any Bank to make any payment calculated by reference
to the amount of loans held or interest received by it, by an amount
deemed material by such Bank, or

            (c)     affects the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling any Bank
and such Bank determines the amount of capital required is increased by
or based upon the existence of this Agreement or its obligation to make
Loans hereunder or of commitments of this type,

Then, within 15 days of demand by such Bank through the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower shall pay such Bank that portion of such increased
expense incurred (including, in the case of Section 3.2(c), any
reduction in the rate of return on capital to an amount below that
which it could have achieved but for such law, rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive and after taking into account such
Bank's policies as to capital adequacy) or reduction in an amount
received which such Bank determines is attributable to making, funding
and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Bank fails to make a claim within 90 days after it
becomes, or ought reasonably to have become, aware of any event giving
rise to a claim under this Section 3.2, then such Bank shall be
entitled to make any claim under this Section 3.2 only in respect of
any amounts due under this Section 3.2 that are attributable to the
period following the 90th day preceding the day upon which the Bank
makes such claim.

     3.3.    Availability of Rate Options.  If any Bank determines that
             ____________________________
maintenance of any of its Fixed Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Office
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, such Bank shall so notify the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall suspend the
availability of the affected Rate Option and require any Fixed Rate
Advances outstanding under the affected Rate Option to be repaid; or if
any Bank determines that (i) deposits of a type or maturity appropriate
to match fund Fixed Rate Advances are not available, the Administrative
Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Rate Option with
respect to any Fixed Rate Advances made after the date of any such
determination, or (ii) a Rate Option does not accurately reflect the
cost of making a Fixed Rate Advance at such Rate Option, such Bank
shall so notify the Administrative Agent and then the Administrative
Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Rate Option with
respect to any Fixed Rate Advances made after the date of any such
determination.

     3.4.    Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a Fixed Rate
             _______________________
Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable
Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment, automatic
conversion or otherwise, or the Borrower requests a Fixed Rate Advance,
or the continuation or conversion of an Advance as or to a Fixed Rate
Advance, and the Borrower does not borrow, continue or convert such
Fixed Rate Advance on the date specified by the Borrower except by
reason of default by the Banks, the Borrower will indemnify each Bank
for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including any
loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or
maintain the Fixed Rate Advance.

     3.5.    Regulation D Compensation.  Each Bank may through the
             _________________________
Administrative Agent request the Borrower to pay and upon such request
the Borrower shall pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest
on the Borrower's Eurodollar Ratable Loans, additional interest on such
Loans at a rate per annum determined by such Bank up to but not
exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the Eurodollar Base Rate divided by (B)
one minus the Reserve Requirement with respect to Eurodollar
    _____
liabilities over (ii) the Eurodollar Base Rate.  Any Bank wishing to
require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional
interest on the Eurodollar Ratable Loans of such Bank shall be payable
to such Bank at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each
Interest Period commencing at least five Business Days after the giving
of such notice, and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five
Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the
Eurodollar Ratable Loans of the amount then due it under this Section.

     3.6.    Bank Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent
             ______________________________________
reasonably possible, each Bank shall designate an alternate Lending
Office with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans to reduce any liability of
the Borrower to such Bank under Section 3.1 or 3.2 or to avoid the
unavailability of a Rate Option under Section 3.3, so long as such
designation is not prohibited by applicable legal and regulatory
restrictions and not disadvantageous to such Bank as determined in its
sole discretion.  Each Bank shall deliver to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent a written statement of such Bank as to the amount
due, if any, under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4, simultaneously with making
a request for payment under said Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4.  Such
written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations
upon which such Bank determined such amount and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest
error.  Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a Fixed Rate Loan shall be calculated as though each
Bank funded its Fixed Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit of
the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference
in determining the Fixed Rate for such Loan, whether in fact that is
the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount
specified in the written statement shall be payable on demand after
receipt by the Borrower of the written statement.  The Obligations of
the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     3.7.    Removal of Banks.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to
             ________________
make or continue any Loans as, or convert Loans to, Eurodollar Ratable
Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.3, or (ii) any Bank has
demanded compensation under Section 3.1 or 3.2, the Borrower may elect
to terminate this Agreement as to such Bank, provided that (i) the
Borrower notifies such Bank through the Administrative Agent of such
election at least five Business Days before any date fixed for a
borrowing, (ii) the Borrower repays all outstanding Obligations to such
Bank at the end of the respective Interest Periods applicable thereto
and (iii) no Default or Unmatured Default exists.  Upon receipt by the
Administrative Agent of such notice, the Commitment of such Bank shall
terminate.

                          _________
hereby expressly instructs such counsel to prepare and deliver to the
Administrative Agent and the Banks for their benefit).

or any Subsidiary in the performance of any term, provision or
condition contained in any agreement under any such Indebtedness was
created or is governed, or any other event shall occur or condition
exist, the effect of which is to cause, or to permit the holder or
holders of such Indebtedness to cause such Indebtedness to become due

or any Subsidiary shall be declared to be due and payable or required
to be prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled payment) prior to

                              ARTICLE VIII
              ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES
              ______________________________________________

     8.1.    Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.5,
             ____________
7.6 or 7.7 occurs, the obligations of the Banks to make Loans to the
Borrower hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations of
the Borrower shall immediately become due and payable without any
election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank.
If any other Default occurs, the Majority Banks may terminate or
suspend the obligations of the Banks to make  Loans to the Borrower
hereunder, or declare the  Obligations of the Borrower to be due and
payable, or both, whereupon such  Obligations shall become immediately
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

     If, within 14 days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Banks to make
Loans hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as
described in Section 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 or 7.10) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained
or entered, the Majority Banks (in their sole discretion) shall so
direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower,
rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.

     8.2.    Amendments and Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any
             ______________________
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent
to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless
in writing signed by the Majority Banks and the Borrower and
acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such
amendment, waiver or consent shall:

            (a)     waive any condition set forth in Section 4.1
without the written consent of each Bank;

            (b)     extend or increase the Commitment of any Bank (or
reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.1) without
the written consent of such Bank;

            (c)     postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or
other amounts due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or under any
other Loan Document without the written consent of each Bank directly
affected thereby;

            (d)     reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest
specified herein on, any Loan, or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or change the manner of
computation of any financial ratio (including any change in any
applicable defined term) used in determining the Applicable Margin,
Applicable Facility Fee Rate, or Applicable Utilization Fee Rate, as
the case may be, that would result in a reduction of any interest rate
on any Loan or any fee payable hereunder without the written consent of
each Bank directly affected thereby;

            (e)     change Section 2.5.8 or Section 12.2 in a manner
that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby
without the written consent of each Bank; or

            (f)     change any provision of this Section or the
definition of "Majority Banks" or any other provision hereof specifying
the number or percentage of Banks required to amend, waive or otherwise
modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any
consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Bank;


provided, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing
________
and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Banks
required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and provided further
that the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder
waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.

     8.3.    Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Banks
             ______________________
or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan
Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any
Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan
notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of the
Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise
of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other
variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents
whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Banks and the
Administrative Agent required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to
the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative
and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks
until the Obligations have been paid in full.

                                 ARTICLE IX
                                   NOTICES
                                   _______

     9.1.    Giving Notice.  Except as otherwise permitted by Section
             _____________
2.5.9 with respect to borrowing notices, all notices and other

return receipt requested and properly addressed with postage prepaid,
shall be deemed given when received and receipt confirmed; any notice,
if transmitted by facsimile, shall be deemed given when legibly
transmitted and receipt confirmed.

     9.2.    Change of Address.  The Borrower, the Administrative Agent
             _________________
and any Bank may each change the address for notices by a notice in
writing, in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to
the other parties hereto and, in the case of any Bank, to the Borrower

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS
                           __________________

     10.1.   Survival of Representations.  All representations and
             ___________________________
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith
or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be
relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, regardless of
any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Bank or on
their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any
Bank may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Unmatured
Default at the time of any Loan or Commitment, and shall continue in
full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

     10.2.   Governmental Regulation.  Anything contained in this
             _______________________
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Bank shall be obligated
to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or
prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation.

     10.3.   Taxes.  Any taxes (excluding income taxes) or other
             _____
similar assessments or charges payable or ruled payable by any
Governmental Authority in respect of the Loan Documents shall be paid
by the Borrower, together with interest and penalties, if any.

     10.4.   Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
             ________
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation
of any of the provisions of the Loan Documents.

     10.5.   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other
             ________________
Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the
parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter.  In the
event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and
those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or
               ________
remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Banks in any other
Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement.  Each
Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor
in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning
thereof.

     10.6.   Several Obligations.  The obligations of the Banks
             ___________________
hereunder to make Ratable Loans are several and not joint.  No Bank
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to
which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such).  The
failure of any Bank to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall
not relieve any other Bank from any of its obligations hereunder. This
Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit
upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns.

     10.7.   Expenses; Indemnification.
             _________________________

            (a)     The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent for all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver,
consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
consummated), and the consummation and administration of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all Attorney
Costs, and (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and each
Bank for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including
all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout" or
restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal
proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law),
including all Attorney Costs.  The foregoing costs and expenses shall
include all search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal
charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the cost of
independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by
the Administrative Agent or any Bank.  All amounts due under this
Section 10.7 shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand
therefor.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination
of the Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

            (b)     Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Administrative Agent-Related Person, each Bank and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims,
demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements
(including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may
at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such
Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or in connection
with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or
administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or
instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
thereby or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
(b) any Commitment or Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds
therefrom, or (c) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding by third parties relating to any of the
foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory
(including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any
pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding)
and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the
foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the
extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee, subject to Oregon Revised Statutes
Section 20.096 No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising
from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained
through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in
connection with this Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee have any
liability for any indirect or consequential damages relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its activities
in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the
Closing Date).  All amounts due under this Section 10.7 shall be
payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor.  The agreements
in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative
Agent, the replacement of any Bank, the termination of the Commitments
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other
Obligations.

     10.8.   Numbers of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing
             ____________________

             __________
all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all
accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with
Agreement Accounting Principles.  The Borrower will not make any change
in its fiscal year or in the accounting principles and methods used in
preparing its financial statements.

     10.10.  Severability of Provisions.  Any provision of this
             __________________________
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party
that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof,
and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

     10.11.  Nonliability of Banks.  The relationship between the
             _____________________
Borrower and the Banks and the Administrative Agent with respect to
this Agreement shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any fiduciary
responsibilities to the Borrower with respect to this Agreement.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank undertakes under this
Agreement any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's
business or operations.

defined below); except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and
its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors who are involved with the
lending facility contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood
that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority (including any bank examiner or self-regulatory
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners); (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any
other party hereto; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding

agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
professional advisor) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations; (g) with the consent of the Borrower;
or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than the Borrower.  For purposes of this
Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower
          ___________
relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank
on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower;
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower
________
after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified in
writing at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this
Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do
so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its
own confidential information.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, "Information" shall not include, and the Administrative Agent
and each Bank may disclose without limitation of any kind, any
information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in
each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4)
of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the
Administrative Agent or such Bank relating to such tax treatment and
tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar
item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other
information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the
document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax
structure of the Loans and transactions contemplated hereby.

     10.13.  CHOICE OF LAW.  THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE
             _____________
CONTAINING A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF
CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF OREGON BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS
APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

     10.14.  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
             _______________________
SUBMITS TO THE NON?EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL
OR OREGON STATE COURT SITTING IN PORTLAND, OREGON IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE
BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE
VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR
THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY BANK TO BRING PROCEEDINGS
AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

     10.15.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE
             ____________________
AGENT AND EACH BANK HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER
SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP
ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

     10.16.  OREGON LEGAL NOTICE.  UNDER OREGON LAW, MOST AGREEMENTS,

ACT CONCERNING LOANS AND OTHER CREDIT EXTENSIONS WHICH ARE NOT FOR
PERSONAL, FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES OR SECURED SOLELY BY THE

                              ARTICLE XI
                        THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
                        ________________________

     11.1.   Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent.
             _____________________________________________________
Each Bank hereby irrevocably, subject to Section 11.9, appoints,
designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action
on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other
Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as
are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative
Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Bank or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against
the Administrative Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other
Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
between independent contracting parties.

     11.2.   Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may
             ____________________
execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall
be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

     11.3.   Liability of Administrative Agent.  No Administrative
             _________________________________
Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated
hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in
connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be
responsible in any manner to any Bank or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer thereof,
contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or
received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or for any failure of Borrower or any other party
to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder.  No Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Bank or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to
the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect
the properties, books or records of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates thereof.

     11.4.   Reliance by Administrative Agent.
             ________________________________

            (a)     The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone
message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Majority Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance
with a request or consent of the Majority Banks (or such greater number
of Banks as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding upon all the Banks.

            (b)     For purposes of determining compliance with the
conditions specified in Section 4.1, each Bank that has signed this
Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or
to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder
to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a
Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
such Bank prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection
thereto.

     11.5.   Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be
             _________________
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or
Unmatured Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received written notice from a Bank or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default."  The Administrative Agent will
notify the Banks of its receipt of any such notice.  The Administrative
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as may be
directed by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article VIII;
provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has
________  _______
received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in
the best interest of the Banks.

     11.6.   Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by
             _____________________________________________
Administrative Agent.  Each Bank acknowledges that no Administrative
____________________
Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and
that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any
consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Administrative Agent-
Related Person to any Bank as to any matter, including whether
Administrative Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material
information in their possession.  Each Bank represents to the
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder.  Each Bank
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon
any Administrative Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to
the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Banks by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any
credit or other information concerning the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness
of Borrower or any of its Affiliates which may come into the possession
of any Administrative Agent-Related Person.

     11.7.   Indemnification of Administrative Agent.  Whether or not
             _______________________________________
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall
indemnify upon demand each Administrative Agent-Related Person (to the
extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower and without limiting
the obligation of Borrower to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each
Administrative Agent-Related Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Bank
                                        ________  _______
shall be liable for the payment to any Administrative Agent-Related
Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent
determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Administrative Agent-Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however,
                                                     ________  _______
that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Majority
Banks shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon
demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses
(including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations,
legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the
extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such
expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.  The undertaking in this
Section shall survive termination of the Commitments, the payment of
all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

     11.8.   Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity.  Bank of
             ___________________________________________
America and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
Borrower and its Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the
Banks.  The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank
of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding Borrower
or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of Borrower or such Affiliate) and
acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation
to provide such information to them.  With respect to its Loans, Bank
of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
as any other Bank and may exercise such rights and powers as though it
were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks"
include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

     11.9.   Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent
             ______________________________
may, and at the request of the Majority Banks shall, resign as
Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks.  If the
Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Banks
shall appoint from among the Banks a successor administrative agent for
the Banks, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to
by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an
Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).  If no successor administrative agent is
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Banks and the Borrower, a successor administrative
agent from among the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
successor administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such
successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article XI and Section 10.7 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative
Agent under this Agreement.  If no successor administrative agent has
accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30
days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation,
the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of the
duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any,
as the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

     11.10.  Foreign Banks.  Each Bank that is a "foreign corporation,
             _____________
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to
withholding under the Code (or after accepting an assignment of an
interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form
W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Person and entitling
it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all
payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all
payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent that such Person is entitled to an exemption from,
or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax.  Thereafter and from time to
time, each such Person shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, (a)
promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly
completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor
forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United
States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current
United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any
available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding
taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Person by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (b) promptly notify the
Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify
or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (c) take such
steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the
reasonable judgment of such Bank, and as may be reasonably necessary
(including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any
requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Person.  If such
Person, to the extent it may lawfully do so, fails to deliver the above
forms or other documentation, then the Administrative Agent may
withhold from any interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent
to the applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of
the Code, without reduction.  If any Governmental Authority asserts
that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold any tax or
other amount from payments made in respect of such Person, such Person
shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the
amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative
Agent.  The obligations of the Banks under this Section shall survive
the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of
the Administrative Agent.

     11.11.  Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of
             _____________________________________________
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective
of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as
herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the
Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise

            (a)     to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims
of the Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and
counsel and all other amounts due the Banks and the Administrative
Agent under Sections 2.4 and 10.7 allowed in such judicial proceeding;
and

            (b)     to collect and receive any monies or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding
is hereby authorized by each Bank to make such payments to the
Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Banks, to
pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts
due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.4 and 10.7.

          Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Bank or
to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim
of any Bank in any such proceeding.

     11.12.  Other Agents; Co-Lead Arrangers.  None of the Persons
             _______________________________
identified in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Co-
Documentation Agent" or "Co-Arranger" shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement
other than those applicable to all Banks as such.  Without limiting the
foregoing, none of the Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to
have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank.  Each Bank acknowledges
that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Persons so
identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not
taking action hereunder.

                              ARTICLE XII
                       SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS
                       ________________________

     12.1.   Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the
             ______
Banks provided by law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default or Unmatured Default occurs and is
continuing, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by
the Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at
any time owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank, now or
hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative
Agent or such Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or
unmatured.  Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by
such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
           ________  _______
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

     12.2.   Ratable Payments.  If any Bank, whether by setoff or
             ________________
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans in a greater
proportion than that received by any other Bank (except as specifically
contemplated by the terms of this Agreement), such Bank agrees,
promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Loans held by the
other Banks so that after such purchase each Bank will hold its ratable
proportion of Loans.  If any Bank, whether in connection with setoff or
amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts
which may be subject to set off, such Bank agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Banks share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In
case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise,
appropriate further adjustments shall be made.  Nothing in this Section
shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or
counterclaim it may have and apply the amount subject to such exercise
to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than the
Obligations.

                             ARTICLE XIII
            BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
            _________________________________________________

13.1 Successors and Assigns.

            (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Bank
and no Bank may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section or (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of
this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any
party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d)
of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

            (b)     Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more
Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the
Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of
an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund (as
defined in subsection (g) of this Section) with respect to a Bank, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes
Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment,
determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to
such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade
Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment
shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this
clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of Competitive Bid
Loans; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the
Administrative Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a
Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank (whether or not the proposed assignee
would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section,
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder, if not already a party
hereto, shall become a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of
the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the
assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and
10.7 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the
effective date of such assignment).  Upon request, the Borrower (at its
expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Bank.

            (c)     The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the
Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts
of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time
to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant
to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall
be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (d)     Any Bank may at any time, without the consent of,
or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the
Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries ) (each, a
"Participant") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Bank's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank
shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any  provision of this
Agreement.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.1 as though it were a
Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 12.2 as
though it were a Bank.

            (e)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 3.1 or 3.4 than the applicable Bank would
have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent.  A
Participant that would be a Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 unless the Borrower is notified
of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 11.10
as though it were a Bank.

            (f)     Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of
such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to
a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
shall release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party
hereto.

            (g)     As used herein, the following terms have the
following meanings:
"Eligible Assignee" means  (a) a Bank; (b) an Affiliate of a Bank; (c)
an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural
person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, and (ii) unless a
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (each such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that
notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not include
the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

"Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will
be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in
commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary
course of its business.

"Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a
Bank, (b) an Affiliate of a Bank or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an
entity that administers or manages a Bank.

                                 NIKE, INC.
                        1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
                   NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     Pursuant to the 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") of NIKE, Inc., an
Oregon corporation (the "Company"), the Company grants to ___________________
(the "Optionee") the right and the option (the "Option") to purchase all or any
part of ____ shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock at a purchase price
of $_____ per share, subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement
between the Company and the Optionee (this "Agreement").  By accepting this
Option grant, the Optionee agrees to all of the terms and conditions of the
Option grant.  The terms and conditions of the Option grant set forth in
attached Exhibit A are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement.

     1.     Grant Date; Expiration Date.  The Grant Date for this Option is
_________.  The Option shall continue in effect until _________ (the
"Expiration Date") unless earlier terminated as provided in Sections 1, 4 or 5
of Exhibit A.  The Option shall not be exercisable on or after the Expiration
Date.

     2.     Vesting of Option. The Vesting Reference Date of this Option is
_______.  Until it expires or is terminated as provided in Sections 1, 4 or 5
of Exhibit A, the Option may be exercised from time to time to purchase whole
shares as to which it has become exercisable.  The Option shall become
exercisable for 25% of the shares on each of the first four anniversaries of
the Vesting Reference Date, so that the Option will be fully exercisable on the
fourth anniversary of the Vesting Reference Date.

     3.     Non-Statutory Stock Option.  The Company hereby designates the
Option to be a non-statutory stock option, rather than an Incentive Stock
Option as defined in Section 422 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

                                              ______________________________
                                               Philip H. Knight,
                                               Chief Executive Officer



                                     NIKE, INC.

                                   EXHIBIT A TO
                            1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
                      NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT


     1.     Termination of Employment or Service.

            1.1     General Rule.  Except as provided in this Section 1, the
Option may not be exercised unless at the time of exercise the Optionee is
employed by or in the service of the Company and shall have been so employed or
provided such service continuously since the Grant Date.  For purposes of this
Exhibit A, the Optionee is considered to be employed by or in the service of
the Company if the Optionee is employed by or in the service of the Company or
any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company (an "Employer").

            1.2     Termination Generally. If the Optionee's employment or
service with the Company terminates for any reason other than because of the
Optionee's total disability, death or retirement as provided in Sections 1.3,
1.4 or 1.5, the Option may be exercised at any time before the Expiration Date
or the expiration of three months after the date of termination, whichever is
the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the Optionee was entitled to
exercise the Option at the date of termination.

            1.3     Termination Because of Total Disability. If the Optionee's
employment or service with the Company terminates because of total disability,
the Option shall immediately become exercisable in full and may be exercised at
any time before the Expiration Date or before the date that is one year after
the date of termination, whichever is the shorter period.  The term "total
disability" means a medically determinable mental or physical impairment that
is expected to result in death or has lasted or is expected to last for a
continuous period of 12 months or more and that, in the opinion of the Company
and two independent physicians, causes the Optionee to be unable to perform
duties as an employee, director, officer or consultant of the Employer and
unable to be engaged in any substantial gainful activity.  Total disability
shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day after the two independent
physicians have furnished their written opinion of total disability to the
Company and the Company has reached an opinion of total disability.

            1.4     Termination Because of Death.  If the Optionee dies while
employed by or in the service of the Company, the Option shall immediately
become exercisable in full and may be exercised at any time before the
Expiration Date or before the date that is one year after the date of death,
whichever is the shorter period, but only by the person or persons to whom the
Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by the Optionee's will or by the
laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of domicile at the
time of death.

            1.5     Termination Because of Retirement.  If the Optionee's
employment or service with the Company terminates because of the Optionee's
retirement, the Option may be exercised at any time before the Expiration Date
or before the expiration of three months after the date of termination,
whichever is the shorter period, but only to the extent specified in this
Section 1.5.  For purposes of this Section 1.5, the term "retirement" means a
termination of employment or service that occurs at a time when (a) the
Optionee's retirement point total is at least 55, and (b) the Optionee has been
employed by or in the service of the Company or a parent or subsidiary
corporation of the Company for at least five full years.  For purposes of this
Section 1.5, the term "retirement point total" means the sum of the Optionee's
age in full years plus the number of full years that the Optionee has been
employed by or in the service of the Company or a parent or subsidiary
corporation of the Company.  Upon the Optionee's retirement, the Optionee may
exercise the portion of the Option that the Optionee was entitled to exercise
immediately prior to retirement plus a percentage of the remaining unvested
portion of the Option based on the Optionee's retirement point total at the
time of retirement as set forth in the following table:

                                            Percent of Unvested Option
           Retirement Point Total            That Becomes Exercisable
           ______________________            ________________________

                 55 or 56                               20%
                    57                                  40%
                    58                                  60%
                    59                                  80%
                    60                                 100%

            1.6     Absence on Leave.  Absence on leave or on account of
illness or disability under rules established by the committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company appointed to administer the Plan (the "Committee")
shall not be deemed an interruption of employment or service.

            1.7     Failure to Exercise Option.  To the extent that following
termination of employment or service, the Option is not exercised within the
applicable periods described above, all further rights to purchase shares
pursuant to the Option shall cease and terminate.

     2.     Method of Exercise of Option.  The Option may be exercised only by
notice in writing from the Optionee to the Company of the Optionee's binding
commitment to purchase shares, specifying the number of shares the Optionee
desires to purchase under the Option and the date on which the Optionee agrees
to complete the transaction and, if required to comply with the Securities Act
of 1933, containing a representation that it is the Optionee's intention to
acquire the shares for investment and not with a view to distribution.  On or
before the date specified for completion of the purchase, the Optionee must pay
the Company the full purchase price of those shares in cash or by check  Unless
the Committee determines otherwise, no shares shall be issued until full
payment for the shares has been made, including all amounts owed for tax
withholding.  The Optionee shall, immediately upon notification of the amount
due, if any, pay to the Company in cash or by check amounts necessary to
satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements.
If additional withholding is or becomes required (as a result of exercise of
the Option or as a result of disposition of shares acquired pursuant to
exercise of the Option) beyond any amount deposited before delivery of the
certificates, the Optionee shall pay such amount to the Company, in cash or by
check, on demand.  If the Optionee fails to pay the amount demanded, the
Company or the Employer may withhold that amount from other amounts payable to
the Optionee, including salary, subject to applicable law.

     3.     Nontransferability.  The Option is nonassignable and
nontransferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law,
except as provided below and except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution of the state or country of the Optionee's domicile at the time of
death, and during the Optionee's lifetime, the Option is exercisable only by
the Optionee.  The Option shall also be transferable pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or
Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  Following any
permitted transfer, the Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms
and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the transfer, provided
that, except for purposes of Section 1, the term "Optionee" shall be deemed to
refer to the transferee.  All references in Section 1 to employment or service,
termination of employment or service and total disability, death and retirement
shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Optionee.  Following
any termination of employment or service or total disability, death or
retirement of the original Optionee as described in Section 1, the Option shall
be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent and for the periods
specified.

     4.     Changes in Capital Structure.  If the outstanding shares of Common
Stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the
Company or of another corporation by reason of any reorganization, merger,
consolidation, plan of exchange, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
split-up, combination of shares or dividend payable in shares, appropriate
adjustment shall be made by the Committee in the number and kind of shares
subject to the Option, or the unexercised portion thereof, so that the
Optionee's proportionate interest before and after the occurrence of the event
is maintained; provided, however, that this Section 4 shall not apply with
respect to Approved Transactions (as defined below).   Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Committee shall have no obligation to effect any adjustment that
would or might result in the issuance of fractional shares, and any fractional
shares resulting from any adjustment may be disregarded or provided for in any
manner determined by the Committee.  Any such adjustments made by the Committee
shall be conclusive.  In the event of any merger, consolidation or plan of
exchange affecting the Company to which Section 5 does not apply, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, provide a 30-day period prior to such event during
which the Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option, in whole or in
part, without any limitation on exercisability, and upon the expiration of such
30-day period, the Option shall immediately terminate.

     5.     Special Acceleration in Certain Events.  Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, the Option shall, at any time when the
shareholders of the Company approve an Approved Transaction, immediately become
exercisable in full during the remainder of the term of the Option; provided,
however, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a 30-day
period prior to the Approved Transaction during which the Optionee shall have
the right to exercise the Option, in whole or in part, without any limitation
on exercisability, and upon the expiration of such 30-day period, the Option
shall immediately terminate.  For purposes of this Section 5, the term
"Approved Transaction" means (a) any consolidation, merger, plan of exchange or
transaction involving the Company (a "Merger") in which the Company is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which the Common Stock of
the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other
than a Merger involving the Company in which the holders of the Common Stock of
the Company immediately prior to the Merger have the same proportionate
ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation after the Merger or (b)
any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of
related transactions) of all or substantially all of the  assets of the Company
or the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of
the Company.

     6.     Conditions on Obligations.  The Company shall not be obligated to
issue shares of Class B Common Stock upon exercise of the Option if the Company
is advised by its legal counsel that such issuance would violate applicable
state or federal laws, including securities laws.  The Company will use its
best efforts to take steps required by state or federal law or applicable
regulations in connection with issuance of shares upon exercise of the Option.

     7.       No Right to Employment or Service.  Nothing in the Plan or this
Agreement shall (a) confer upon the Optionee any right to be continued in the
employment of an Employer or interfere in any way with the Employer's right to
terminate the Optionee's employment at will at any time, for any reason, with
or without cause, or to decrease the Optionee's compensation or benefits, or
(b) confer upon the Optionee any right to be retained or employed by the
Employer or to the continuation, extension, renewal or modification of any
compensation, contract or arrangement with or by the Employer.  The
determination of whether to grant any option under the Plan is made by the
Company in its sole discretion. The grant of the Option shall not confer upon
the Optionee any right to receive any additional option or other award under
the Plan or otherwise.

     8.     Successors of Company.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of any successor of the Company but, except as
provided herein, the Option may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by the
Optionee.

     9.     Rights as a Shareholder.  The Optionee shall have no rights as a
shareholder with respect to any shares of Class B Common Stock until the date
the Optionee becomes the holder of record of those shares.  No adjustment shall
be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs before
the date the Optionee becomes the holder of record.

     10.    Amendments.   The Company may at any time amend this Agreement to
extend the expiration periods provided in Section 1 or to increase the portion
of the Option that is exercisable.  Otherwise, this Agreement may not be
amended without the written consent of the Optionee and the Company.

     11.    Committee Determinations.  The Optionee agrees to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations of the
Committee or other administrator of the Plan as to the provisions of the Plan
or this Agreement or any questions arising thereunder.

     12.    Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
state of Oregon.

     13.     Complete Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the Optionee and the Company, both oral and written
concerning the matters addressed herein, and all prior agreements or
representations concerning the matters addressed herein, whether written or
oral, express or implied, are terminated and of no further effect.
