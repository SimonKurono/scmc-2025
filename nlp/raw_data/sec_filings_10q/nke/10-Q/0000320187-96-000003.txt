              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
NOTE 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies: 
         ___________________________________________ 
 
Basis of Presentation: 
 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which 
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of 
the results of operations for the interim period(s).  The interim financial 
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's latest annual report to shareholders.  The results of operations 
for the three and nine months ended February 29, 1996 are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - Net income per common share: 
         ___________________________ 
 
     Net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average 
number of common and common equivalent (stock option) shares outstanding 
for the period(s). 
 
     During the second quarter, the Company effected a two-for-one split of the 
outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock 
dividend.  The applicable outstanding shares and net income per common share 
figures for previous periods have been restated to reflect this change. 
 
     
NOTE 3 - Inventories: 
         ___________ 
 
     Inventories by major classification are as follows: 
 
                                        Feb. 29,      May 31,

NOTE 4 - Commitments and contingencies: 
         _____________________________ 
 
     There have been no other significant subsequent developments 
relating to the commitments and contingencies reported on the 
Company's most recent Form 10-K.  


 
NOTE 5 - Change in year-end of certain subsidiaries: 
 
     Currently certain of the Company's international operations report 
their results of operations on a one month lag which allows more time to 
compile results.  The Company has taken steps to improve its internal 
reporting procedures that will allow for more timely reporting of these 
operations.  Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the one 
month lag will be eliminated and as a result, the May 1996 results of 
operations of these entities will be recorded to retained earnings for 
fiscal 1996. The following tables include adjusted quarterly data for 
the previous fiscal year as well as the first three quarters of this fiscal 
year as if the change were already in effect.

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
Operating Results 
_________________ 
 
     Net income increased 19.3% for the fiscal third quarter ended 
February 29, 1996 over the same period last year. Continued strong 
revenue growth was the primary factor in record results for the 
quarter, increasing 32.6% over last year.  This represents the 
Company's sixth straight quarter of double digit increases in total 
revenues and net income.  For the nine months ended February 29, 1996, 
net income increased 38.6%, again on strong revenue growth of 35.8% 
and a reduction of selling and administrative costs as percentage of 
revenues from 25.1% to 24.2%, which was offset by an increase in 
interest and other expenses.  The Company believes the continued 
strong revenues and earnings growth is a result of the strength of 
the NIKE Brand, with a focused effort on new and innovative product 
in all areas of the business.  In addition, the Company continues 
to focus on developing the NIKE Brand outside the U.S., where sales 
for the trailing 12 month period surpassed the $2 billion level for 
the first time.  
 
     The Company experienced double digit revenue growth during the 
quarter and nine months ended February 29, 1996 across all the 
breakout categories (see chart), with the most significant increase 
in U.S. apparel, which grew $100.5 million, or 85.1%, and $286.1 
million, or 92.1%, respectively.  For the quarter, U.S. apparel 
exceeded $200 million for the first time ever.  U.S. footwear 
increased $65.0 million, or $10.8%, and $284.5 million, or 16.6%, 
for the three and nine months ended February 29, 1996, respectively.  
For the quarter, the increase in U.S. footwear was a result of a 12% 
increase in pairs sold and 1% reduction in average selling prices.  
Men's basketball, men's and kids' cross training and women's fitness 
dominated the U.S. footwear category.  International revenues increased 
$153.2 million, or 44.3%, and $417.6 million, or 36.4%, for the three 
and nine months ended February 29, 1996, respectively.  Excluding the 
positive effects of a weaker U.S. dollar, third quarter international 
revenues grew 42%.  For the quarter on a constant dollar basis, all 
regions experienced strong double digit growth, with the most 
significant increases in Europe and Asia Pacific regions up 45% and 46%, 
respectively.  For the nine months ended February 29, 1996, Europe is up 
29% and Asia Pacific is up 37% compared to the prior year.  Other 
Brands, which includes Cole Haan (R), Tetra Plastics, Sports Specialties 
and Canstar Sports, increased $48.3 million or 84.1%, and $212.3 
million, or 120.1%, for the three and nine months ended February 29, 
1996, respectively.  $38.7 million and $181.7 million of the increase in 
Other Brands for the three and nine months ended February 29, 1996, 
respectively, relates to Canstar Sports, which the Company acquired at 
the end of the third quarter of the prior year. 
 
The breakdown of revenues follows:

     Consolidated gross margin percentage was 39.5% for the quarter 
compared to 39.7% for last year's third quarter.  For the nine months 
ended February 29,1996, margins remained flat with last year at 39.7%.  
Strong demand for NIKE products worldwide and sound inventory 
management are holding margins stable on a year-to-date basis.  The 
Company continues to place strong emphasis on inventory management, 
minimizing foreign exchange risk and production sourcing in order to 
maximize gross profit.  The Company expects gross profit percentages for 
the remaining three months of fiscal year 1996 to be affected by strong 
demand for NIKE products offset by continued higher levels of air 
freight expense to meet the delivery dates on increasing customer 
orders.* 
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $104.4 million in 
absolute dollars for the quarter ended February 29, 1996, and as a 
percentage of revenues increased one percentage point to 25.7% compared 
to the same period last year.  On a year to date basis, selling and 
administrative expenses have increased $261.4 million, but have 
decreased to 24.2% of consolidated revenues compared to 25.1% in the 
prior year.  For the quarter, U.S. operations expenses increased $38.4 
million and international expenses increased $46.6 million, primarily a 
result of planned increases in marketing and advertising expenses as 
well as infrastructure to support the growth outside the U.S.  Canstar 
Sports accounted for $11.1 million of the increase.  The Company intends 
to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to increase marketing 
and advertising expenses in order to ensure the successful sell-through 
of the high level of orders discussed below.*  As a result, the Company 
expects selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
for the current year to approximate that of the prior year.* 
 
     Interest expense increased $5.4 million and $16.0 million for the 
quarter and nine months ended February 29, 1996, respectively, compared 
to the same period last year.  The increase is due to the higher levels 
of short term borrowings in the U.S. and international needed to fund 
current operations.  In the prior year, fiscal year to date average cash 
and equivalents were higher through February 28, as available cash 
was used to fund the acquisition of Canstar Sports, which occurred at 
the end of the third quarter of the prior year.  Other expense 
increased $4.5 million and $20.8 million for the quarter and nine months 
ended February 29, 1996, respectively, compared to the same periods last 
year.  The increase is primarily due to increased goodwill amortization 
resulting from the acquisition of Canstar Sports and decreased interest 
income from lower available cash. 
 
     The Company's effective tax rate for both the quarter and nine 
months ended February 29, 1996 was 38.5% compared to 39.0% in both of 
the prior year's comparable periods.  The Company anticipates the tax 
rate will remain at 38.5% for fiscal year 1996.* 
 
     Worldwide orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel 
scheduled for delivery from March 1996 through July 1996 were 
approximately $3.4 billion, 38% higher than such orders booked in the 
comparable period of the prior year.  These orders are not necessarily 
indicative of total revenues over that period because the mix of advance 
orders and at once shipments may vary significantly from quarter to 
quarter and year to year.  Additionally, as international operations 
continue to account for a greater percentage of total revenues and place 
a greater emphasis on futures orders, this mix again may vary.  Finally, 
exchange rates can cause differences in the comparisons. 
 
     Currently certain of the Company's international operations report 
their results of operations on a one month lag which allows more time to 
compile their results.  As further discussed in Note 5 to these 
financial statements, the Company will eliminate this one month lag 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997.  The change should 
not have a material effect on the annual results of operations, however, 
quarterly results will change as certain reporting periods will shift 
one month.* 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
     The Company's financial position remains strong, with working 
capital rising $257.8 million since May 31, 1995.  The working capital 
ratio increased from 1.8:1 at May 31, 1995 to 1.9:1 at February 29, 1996. 
 
     Cash and equivalents increased $43.4 million from May 31, 1995. 
Cash provided by operations was reduced by changes in other 
working capital components discussed below.  Other significant uses of 
cash included additions to property, plant and equipment, reductions in 
long-term debt and the dividends payment.  The most significant source of 
cash was from an increase in notes payable. 
 
     The decrease in other working capital components was due primarily 
to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by 
increases in accounts payable.  The increase in accounts receivable 
of $115.8 million was due to sales growth in both January and February 
over last fiscal year's final two months.  Overall inventories 
increased $250.9 million.  U.S. footwear, U.S. apparel and international 
footwear and apparel inventories have increased $13.2 million, $68.0 million 
and $129.0 million, respectively.  Increases in accounts payable are a result 
of the increased levels of the Company's operations, most significantly, 
international operations. 
 
     The additions to property, plant and equipment were composed 
of normal operational spending, the continued consolidation of European 
footwear warehouses, expansion of NIKE Town retail locations and 
acquisition of land adjacent to the world headquarters. 
 
     The Company also utilized cash to retire long-term debt acquired in 
the purchase of Canstar Sports. 
 
     Notes payable increased in order to fund the high level of 
operations. 
 
     For the nine months ended February 29, 1996, the Company has 
purchased 200,000 shares of its own stock under the stock repurchase 
program announced in July 1993, bringing the total number of shares 
purchased in the program to approximately 5,149,000.  There were no 
purchases during the third quarter.
 
     The debt to equity ratio at February 29, 1996 was .6:1 compared 
to .6:1 at May 31, 1995 and .5:1 at February 28, 1995.  Management 
believes that funds generated by operations, together with 
currently available resources, will adequately finance anticipated 
fiscal 1996 expenditures.*  At February 29, 1996, the Company 
had $500 million available in committed unused lines of credit.
