NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
         ___________________________________________

Basis of presentation:

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the results of operations for the interim period.  The interim financial
information and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the
Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations
for the three (3) months ended August 31, 2004 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2005 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously reported
results of operations or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 2 - Inventories:

</TABLE>

     Amortization expense, which is included in selling and administrative
expense, was $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the three-month periods ended
August 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The estimated amortization expense
for intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the succeeding years
ended May 31, 2005 through May 31, 2009 are as follows:  2005: $9.3 million;
2006: $8.6 million; 2007: $7.7 million; 2008: $7.2 million; 2009: $6.2
million.

     On August 11, 2004, the Company acquired Official Starter LLC and
Official Starter Properties LLC (collectively "Official Starter") for $47.2
million, including acquisition costs, net of cash acquired.  The Exeter Brands
Group LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was formed during the
three-months ended August 31, 2004 to develop the Company's business in retail
channels serving value-conscious consumers and operate the Official Starter
business.  As a result of the acquisition, $39.0 million was allocated to
amortized trademarks and $4.6 million was allocated to other amortized
intangible assets.  The weighted average amortization period is nine years in
total and approximately 10 years and three years for amortized trademarks and
other amortized intangible assets, respectively.  The impact of the
acquisition of Official Starter on the Company's financial position and
results of operations for the three-months ended August 31, 2004 was
immaterial.

NOTE 6 - Stock-Based Compensation:
         _________________________

     The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" as permitted by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (FAS 123). The Company's policy is to grant stock options with
an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of grant, and
accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized.  The Company also has an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) that qualifies as a non-compensatory
employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code,
and accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized.

     If the Company had accounted for stock options and ESPP purchase rights
issued to employees in accordance with FAS 123, the Company's pro forma net
income and pro forma earnings per share would have been reported as follows:

     The pro forma effects of applying FAS 123 may not be representative of
the effects on reported net income and earnings per share for future periods
since options vest over several years and additional awards are made each
year.

NOTE 7 - Earnings Per Common Share:
         _________________________

     The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share
to diluted earnings per share.  Options to purchase 5.0 million and 3.9
million shares of common stock were outstanding at August 31, 2004 and
August 31, 2003, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of common shares and, therefore, the
effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 8 - Operating Segments:
         __________________

     The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the
Company's internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic
regions with operations participating in NIKE brand sales activity.  Each NIKE
brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:  the design,
production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and
equipment. The "Other" category shown below represents activities of Cole Haan
Holdings Incorporated, Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE
Golf, Converse Inc., beginning September 4, 2003, and Exeter Brands Group LLC,
beginning August 11, 2004, that are considered immaterial for individual
disclosure based on the aggregation criteria in SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".

     Where applicable, "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements, which generally include corporate
activity and corporate eliminations.

     Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for
each segment.  Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial
for separate disclosure.  The Company evaluates performance of individual
operating segments based on pre-tax income.  On a consolidated basis, this
amount represents income before income taxes as shown in the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Reconciling items for pre-tax
income represent corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting including certain currency exchange rate
gains and losses on transactions and intercompany eliminations for specific
items in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant and equipment for
operating segments are regularly reviewed and therefore provided below.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, revenues, net income and earnings
per share were the highest achieved in any quarter of our history as a public
company. Our revenues grew 18% to $3.6 billion, net income grew 25% to $326.8
million and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.21, a 23% increase
versus the first quarter of fiscal 2004. In addition to growth in our U.S. and
international regions, both the acquisition of Converse and foreign currency
exchange rates added to our overall growth. During the quarter, we also
increased our return on invested capital and increased the level of share
repurchases and dividends as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Consolidated Operating Results

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, consolidated revenues grew 18%; 3
percentage points of this growth were attributable to changes in currency
exchange rates, primarily the stronger euro. Excluding the impact of changes
in foreign currency, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 5
percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth as all three of our
international regions posted higher revenues. The U.S. Region contributed 5
percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth.  Sales in our Other
businesses drove the balance of the improvement with Converse, which was
acquired during the second quarter of fiscal 2004, contributing 4 percentage
points to the overall revenue growth.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, our consolidated gross margin
percentage improved 150 basis points versus the prior year, from 43.0% to
44.5%. The primary factor in the improved gross margin percentage was the
change in currency hedge rates, primarily the euro, which contributed 130
basis points of the year-over-year improvement for the first quarter.  As a
majority of product purchases for fiscal 2005 have been hedged, we expect a
positive impact on our gross margin percentage throughout fiscal 2005 due to
improved year-over-year hedge rates, primarily for the euro.

     First quarter selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand
creation and operating overhead, grew 23% versus the prior year quarter.
Demand creation (advertising and promotion) expense grew 44% to $466.6 million
in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.  Three percentage points of the increase
in demand creation for the first quarter period were due to changes in
currency exchange rates.  Excluding the impact of currency, the increase in
demand creation spending for the first quarter was attributable to increased
spending primarily in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia
Pacific regions for advertising around the summer's global sporting events
including the integrated NIKE "Speed" campaign (21 percentage point impact),
higher spending on endorsement contracts (9 percentage point impact), and
incremental investment in retail development programs (6 percentage point
impact). The addition of Converse also had a 3 percentage point impact on
demand creation for the quarter.

     Operating overhead for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $607.0
million, an 11% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  Currency
exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of this increase, and the
addition of Converse accounted for 3 percentage points of growth. Excluding
the effects of currency and Converse, operating overhead increases for the
quarter were mainly attributable to: (a) normal wage increases and increased
headcount (3 percentage points); (b) investment in the supply chain systems
implementation in Japan and Southeast Asia (1 percentage point); and (c)
investments in NIKE-owned retail stores (1 percentage point).

     Other expense, net, was $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal
2005, down from $23.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The most
significant components of other expense, net, are foreign currency losses
(primarily hedge losses on intercompany charges to a European subsidiary,
whose functional currency is the euro), and hedge losses from that
subsidiary's investments in U.S. Dollar denominated debt securities classified
as available-for-sale. These losses are reflected in the Corporate line in our
segment presentation of pre-tax income in Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (Note 8 - Operating Segments). The year-over-year
improvement in other expense, net, was mainly due to lower foreign currency
hedge losses. Also included in other expense, net, in the first quarter of
fiscal 2004 were net losses on asset disposals, including a loss of $5.3
million for our basis in undeveloped land gifted to the NIKE Foundation.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, net foreign currency losses in other
expense, net, were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign
currency denominated profits, most significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the
net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a $22 million
addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the first
quarter of the prior year. Consistent with our Risk Management Program, we
have also hedged a portion of anticipated intercompany charges and investments
in U.S. Dollar denominated debt securities classified as available-for-sale
for the balance of fiscal 2005. At current exchange rates, we expect the net
impact of the hedge losses and the offsetting positive translation impact will
result in a net benefit to fiscal 2005 consolidated net income, although at a
significantly lower level than the benefit realized throughout fiscal 2004.
See further discussion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of May 31, 2004.

     Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was
35.4%, which is higher than the 34.8% rate reported for the first quarter and
full year of fiscal 2004.  This increase compared to fiscal 2004 is largely
due to lower research tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax income and the
expiration of research tax credit legislation.  Should the proposed research
tax credits be renewed, we would include the benefit of that renewal in
subsequent periods.

     Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from September 2004 through January 2005 were 9.9%
higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2004.
One point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange
rates versus the same period last year. Excluding this currency impact, higher
average selling prices driven by footwear across all regions contributed 2
points of the growth in overall futures and advance orders.  The remaining
increase was due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel. As always,
the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our
expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of
orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition,
exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations
can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual
revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from
futures orders, including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team
apparel, Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, Converse, NIKE Golf, Hurley, Exeter
Brands and retail sales across all brands.

     The discussion following includes disclosure of "pre-tax income" for our
operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating
segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." As
discussed in Note 8 - Operating Segments in the accompanying Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs
are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments.

     For our largest international region, EMEA, changes in currency exchange
rates accounted for 5 percentage points of the reported revenue growth for the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. If we remove the effects of currency, first
quarter revenue for the EMEA Region would have grown approximately 9
percentage points. The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by
increased unit sales of footwear (led by soccer, followed by training
products) and apparel (led by soccer products). Excluding the effect of
changes in foreign currency, revenue growth was led by sales increases in
Italy, the UK and the emerging markets in Central Europe, Turkey, Russia and
Greece, partially offset by weaker results in France and Germany versus the
same period last year.

     For the EMEA Region, futures orders scheduled for delivery from September
2004 through January 2005 were 6 percentage points higher than such orders for
the comparable period of fiscal 2004.  Changes in currency exchange rates
contributed 3 percentage points of this growth. Excluding the changes in
currency exchange rates, the growth was driven by a slight increase in the
region's footwear average selling price per pair and an increase in wholesale
footwear and apparel unit orders.

     EMEA pre-tax income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $246.4
million, up 21% versus the prior year quarter. For the quarter, higher
revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase, more than
offsetting increased selling and administrative costs, primarily demand
creation. The improved gross margins, which contributed 60 basis points of
growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage, were primarily the result
of improved year-over-year hedge rates, partially offset by investments in
product costs.

     In the Asia Pacific Region, revenues increased 17% in the first quarter
of fiscal 2005 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Five percentage
points of growth for the first quarter were due to changes in currency
exchange rates. Excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates,
sales in each Asia Pacific business unit (footwear, apparel and equipment)
grew versus the same period last year. Excluding the effect of changes in
foreign currency, significant revenue increases in China (driven by expansion
of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) and continued growth in
Japan were key growth drivers for the quarter.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific
Region decreased 17% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2004, to $63.4
million. For the quarter, higher revenues and gross margin improvements were
more than offset by increased selling and administrative costs, primarily due
to additional demand creation spending for the Athens Olympics and expansion
of market coverage in China, and investments in operating overhead due to the
implementation of new supply chain systems in Japan and Southeast Asia.
The higher gross margins, which contributed 30 basis points of growth to the
consolidated gross margin percentage, were primarily attributable to the
benefit of better year-over-year hedge rates and a slight improvement for in-
line pricing margins (net revenue for current product offerings minus landed
product cost).

     In the Americas Region, revenues increased 7% for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, including a 3 percentage point decline due to changes in currency
exchange rates. Excluding the currency effects, revenue growth for the quarter
was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in South America and Mexico.
Excluding the currency exchange rate impact, the region experienced sales
growth in the footwear and equipment business units, partially offset by
declines in apparel.

     In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, pre-tax income for the Americas
Region decreased 15% from the prior year quarter, to $20.7 million. The
decrease in pre-tax income was attributable to higher revenues more than
offset by a reduced gross margin percentage and higher selling and
administrative costs, primarily due to increased demand creation spending.
The reduced gross margin percentage negatively impacted the consolidated gross
margin percentage by 10 basis points.

     In the U.S. Region, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 grew
12% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2004 with growth in all three business
units. The increase in apparel sales for the first quarter was primarily
driven by growth in sport performance product and team licensed apparel.

     The increase in footwear revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was
due to an increase in wholesale and NIKE-owned retail unit sales (8 percentage
points of U.S. footwear growth) and an increase in average selling price per
pair driven by wholesale (4 percentage points of U.S. footwear growth). The
increase in wholesale and NIKE-owned retail unit sales is due to increased
consumer demand for performance products across categories. The increase in
average wholesale selling price per pair was primarily due to a larger
percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over $100 versus
sales of products under $100.

     For the U.S. Region, futures orders scheduled for delivery from September
2004 through January 2005 increased 11% versus the same period of the prior
year. Futures orders increased due to increases in wholesale footwear average
selling price per pair consistent with that realized during the quarter and
increased unit orders for both wholesale footwear and apparel.

     For the first quarter, U.S. Region pre-tax income was $321.9 million, a
10% increase versus the first quarter of fiscal 2004. For the quarter, higher
revenues and gross margins drove the increase, more than offsetting higher
selling and administrative costs, primarily demand creation. The improved
gross margins, which contributed 20 basis points of growth to the consolidated
gross margin percentage, were primarily the result of a lower level of close-
out sales as a percentage of total sales and improved close-out pricing
margins.

     Other revenues and pre-tax income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005
include results from Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated,
Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Exeter Brands Group
LLC. The Exeter Brands Group LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc.,
formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to develop the Company's business
in retail channels serving value-conscious consumers and operate the business
obtained in the acquisition of Official Starter Properties LLC and Official
Starter LLC (collectively "Official Starter").  Other revenues grew 64% in the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.  The addition of
Converse, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, contributed 50
percentage points of the Other revenue increase for the quarter. The remaining
14 percentage point increase was due to growth in most of the Other
businesses, most significantly Cole Haan which increased 30% year-over-year.
The impact of the acquisition of Official Starter on the Company's results for
the first quarter was immaterial.

     Other pre-tax income improved to $40.3 million in the first quarter of
fiscal 2005 from a loss of $4.3 million in fiscal 2004.  The addition of
Converse, which contributed $36.9 million of pre-tax income (9 percentage
points to consolidated pre-tax income growth), combined with improved results
from most of the Other businesses drove the year-over-year improvement.  Gross
margin improvements in our Other businesses contributed 20 basis points of
growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage for the quarter.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Activity

     Cash provided by operations was $367.5 million in the first three months
of fiscal 2005, compared to $350.0 million in the first three months of fiscal
2004. Our primary source of operating cash flow in the current period was net
income of $326.8 million compared to $261.2 million in the first quarter of
last year, partially offset by a net increase in our investment in working
capital.

     Total cash used by investing activities during the first three months of
fiscal 2005 was $72.4 million, compared to $42.3 million in the prior year
period. The purchase of short-term investments and acquisition of Official
Starter to form Exeter Brands Group LLC were the most significant uses of cash
during the period, partially offset by the maturation of short-term
investments.  The remaining investing activities were consistent with the
prior year and primarily reflected capital expenditures on computer equipment
and software (to support both normal business operations and our supply chain
systems upgrade), continued investment in NIKE-owned retail stores, and
warehouse improvements.

     Cash used by financing activities during the first three months of fiscal
2005 was $185.5 million, compared to cash provided by financing activities of
$50.8 million in the same period of the prior year. The principal uses of cash
for financing activities were share repurchases, dividends, and repayments of
short-term and long-term debt, offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock
options. Cash provided by financing activities was higher in the first quarter
of fiscal 2004 primarily due to the issuance of short-term debt in that
period.

     The share repurchases were part of a $1.5 billion share repurchase
program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004.  In the
first quarter and to date under the program, we purchased approximately
2.1 million shares of NIKE's Class B common stock for $155.2 million. We
expect to continue to fund this program from operating cash flow. The timing
and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and
stock market conditions.

     Dividends declared per share of common stock in the first quarter of
fiscal 2005 were $0.20 per share.


Capital Resources

     No amounts are currently outstanding under our committed credit facility.
The terms of our facility have not changed from those described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K as of May 31, 2004.

     Our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings remain at A and A2 from
Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which
there was no amount outstanding at August 31, 2004 or May 31, 2004. We
currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's
Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.

     We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with
access to external sources of funds as described above and in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K as of May 31, 2004, will be sufficient to meet our operating and
capital needs in the foreseeable future.

Critical Accounting Policies

     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities.

     We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the
accounting policies described in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial
statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.
Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could
differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account
balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments
under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in
the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since
our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these
estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the
financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the
timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters.

     Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.


Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     There have been no material changes from the information previously
reported under Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2004.


Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

     The Company carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial
Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of August 31, 2004.

     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.


               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
                             and Analyst Reports

     Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical
information including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's
business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from
time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply
future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
"believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will
continue," "will likely result," or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by
NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among
others, the following: international, national and local general economic and
market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear,
apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers,
marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in
consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of
products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products;
difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described
above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKE's
increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance "futures" orders may not
be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-
once orders; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; new
product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect
trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property performance and
reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of
significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery
deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks
associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without
limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas and
political and economic instability; changes in government regulations;
liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by
reference in this report and other reports.

     The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report
may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business
and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it
assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE's business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

     Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time,
communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose
to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of
the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or
confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the
extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,
forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.

                       ARTICLE 2 - Shareholders

     Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of the shareholders of the
                 __________________
Corporation shall be held at Beaverton, Oregon, or any other place,
either within or without Oregon, selected by the Board of Directors, or
in the absence of a selection by the Board of Directors, by the Chairman
of the Board.

     Section 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the
                 ________________
shareholders shall be held on the third Monday in September of each year
if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday then on the next
succeeding business day, at such time as may be designated by the Board
of Directors and specified in the notice of the meeting.  The Board of
Directors shall have the discretion to designate a different annual
meeting date for any year, provided that the date so designated is
within 60 days of the date specified in the preceding sentence.  At the
annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect by vote a Board of
Directors, consider reports of the affairs of the Corporation, and
transact such other business as may properly be brought before the

     Section 3.  Special Meetings.  The Corporation shall hold a special
                 _________________

special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary of the
Corporation one or more written demands for the meeting describing the
purpose or purposes for which it is to be held.  Special meetings of the
shareholders may not be called by any other person or persons.

     Section 4.  Notice of Meetings and Waiver.
                 ______________________________

     (a)    General.  The Corporation shall notify shareholders in
            _______
writing of the date, time and place of each annual and special
shareholders meeting not earlier than 60 days nor less than ten days
before the meeting date.  Except as otherwise required by applicable

                                  1
law, the Corporation is required to give notice only to shareholders
entitled to vote at the meeting.  Such notice is effective when mailed
if it is mailed postage prepaid and is correctly addressed to the
shareholder's address shown in the Corporation's current record of
shareholders.  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, notice of
an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.  Notice of a special meeting
shall include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called.

     (b)    Adjourned Meetings.  If an annual or special shareholders
            __________________
meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not
be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place
is announced at the meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date
for the adjourned meeting is fixed, or is required by law to be fixed,
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to persons who are
shareholders as of the new record date.  A determination of shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders meeting is effective
for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a
new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date
more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

     (c)    Waiver of Notice.  A shareholder's attendance at a meeting
            ________________
waives objection to (i) lack of notice or defective notice of the
meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects
to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (ii)
consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within
the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the
shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

     Section 5.  Quorum.  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting
                 ______
group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those
shares exists with respect to that matter.  Unless otherwise required by
law, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the
voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on
that matter.  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting,
it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the
meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date
is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.  In the absence of a
quorum, a majority of those present in person or represented by proxy
may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum exists.  Any
business that might have been transacted at the original meeting may be
transacted at the adjourned meeting if a quorum exists.

     Section 6.  Voting Rights.  The voting rights of holders of stock
                 _____________
of the Corporation, and the circumstances under which any class of stock
has special voting rights and the manner of exercise thereof, are as set
forth in the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the
"Restated Articles").  Only shares of stock are entitled to vote.
Except as otherwise provided in the Restated Articles or by applicable
law:  (i) each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to
one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders meeting; (ii) if a
quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors,
by a voting group shall be approved if the votes cast within the voting
group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group
opposing the action; and (iii) directors shall be elected by a plurality
of the votes cast by holders of the shares entitled to vote in the
election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

                                  2
     Section 7.  Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.  If the name
                 ___________________________________
signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy corresponds to the name of a
shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to
accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy and give it effect as the act
of the shareholder.  If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or
proxy does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the
Corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless entitled to accept
the vote, consent, waiver or proxy and give it effect as the act of the
shareholder if authorized by ORS 60.237 or any successor provision
dealing with acceptance of votes.

     Shares of the Corporation are not entitled to be voted if (i) they
are owned, directly or indirectly, by another domestic or foreign
corporation, and (ii) the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a
majority of the shares entitled to be voted for the directors of such
other corporation.  This paragraph does not limit the power of a
corporation to vote any shares, including its own shares, held by it in
a fiduciary capacity.

     Any redeemable shares that the Corporation may issue are not
entitled to be voted after notice of redemption is mailed to the holders
and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a
bank, trust company or other financial institution under an irrevocable
obligation to pay the holders the redemption price on surrender of the
shares.

     Section 8.  Proxies.  A shareholder entitled to vote or to execute
                 _______
any waiver or consent may do so either in person or by written proxy
duly executed and filed at or before the meeting at which it is to be
used with the Secretary at the Corporation or other officer or agent of
the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment of a proxy
is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent of
the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment is valid
for 11 months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the
appointment form.  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the
shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is
irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest.

     Section 9.  Shareholder Lists.  After fixing a record date for a
                 _________________
meeting, the Corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names
of all of its shareholders who are entitled to notice of the meeting.
The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting
group, by class or series of shares and show the address of and the
number of shares held by each shareholder.  The shareholder list shall
be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business
days after notice of the meeting for which the list was prepared is
given and continuing through the meeting.  Such list shall be kept on
file at the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in
the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held.  A
shareholder, or the shareholder's agent or attorney, shall be entitled
on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of law, to
copy the list during regular business hours and at the shareholder's
expense during the period it is available for inspection.  The
Corporation shall make the shareholder list available at the meeting,
and any shareholder, or the shareholder's agent or attorney, is entitled
to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.
The original stock transfer book shall be prima facie evidence as to who
are the shareholders entitled to inspect such list or to vote at any
meeting of shareholders.  Refusal or failure to prepare or make

                                  3
available the shareholder list does not affect the validity of action
taken at the meeting.

     (a)    The Chairman of the Board, or such other officer of the
Corporation designated by the Board of Directors, shall call meetings of

ascertaining whether any shareholder or his or her proxy may be excluded
from such meeting based upon any determination by the presiding officer,
in his or her discretion, that any such person has disrupted or is
likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat; and by determining the
circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions
at such meeting.

     (b)    Only business within the purpose or purposes described in
the meeting notice may be conducted at a special shareholders meeting.

     (c)    At the annual meeting of the shareholders, only such

must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii)
otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by

proposals of security holders under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, (the "Proxy Rules") for business to be properly brought
before the annual meeting by a shareholder, including nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors, the shareholder must
have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the
Corporation.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received by
the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not
less than 60 days prior to the meeting.  A shareholder's notice to the
Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting:  (i) a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the annual meeting; (ii) the name

to nominations, all information required by the Proxy Rules.

     (e)    No business shall be conducted at an annual or special
meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 10.  The presiding officer at a shareholders meeting shall, if
the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business
was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.  If the presiding officer should so
determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such
business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be
transacted.

     (f)    The Chairman of the Board shall, in advance of any meeting
of shareholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at
the meeting.  The inspectors of election shall decide upon the

     Section 2.  Number and Qualifications.  The number of directors
                 _________________________

director's term.  Directors need not be residents of Oregon or

The terms of all directors, including a director elected to fill a

shall continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and
qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of directors.

     Section 4.  Vacancies.  A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall
                 _________
exist upon the death, resignation or removal of any director or upon an
increase in the number of directors.  If a vacancy occurs on the Board
of Directors as a result of death, resignation or removal from office of
a director who is elected by a separate class vote of the common stock,
it shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors similarly elected by such class.  If none shall be
remaining, the vacancy shall be filled by all directors then in office.
If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of
the Board, they may fill the vacancy by an affirmative vote of a
majority of all of the directors remaining in office.  If a vacancy
occurs on the Board of Directors as a result of an increase in the
number of directors, the Board of Directors may fill such vacancy,

                                  5
provided they may not elect more than three additional directors in any
period between annual shareholders meetings to fill such vacancies.

     Section 5.  Resignation.  A director may resign at any time by

removed by the shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of
removing the director and the meeting notice must state that the
purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the
director.

     Section 7.  Meetings - Notice and Waiver.
                 ____________________________

     (a)    The Board of Directors may hold regular or special meetings
in or out of Oregon.

     (b)    Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting.  The
Board of Directors may fix, by resolution, the time and place for the

after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present, and if, either
before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present shall
sign a written waiver of notice, or consent to holding such meeting, or
an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of
the minutes of the meeting.  A director's attendance at or participation
in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting
unless the director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon
the director's arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting
business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to
action taken at the meeting.

present, in the absence of a quorum, may adjourn from time to time but

                                  6
may not transact any business.  If a quorum is present when a vote is
taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the
act of the Board of Directors, unless a different vote is required by
law.

     (b)    A director who is present at a meeting of the Board of
Directors, or is present at a meeting of a committee of the Board of
Directors, when corporate action is taken, is deemed to have assented to
the action taken unless (i) the director objects at the beginning of the
meeting, or promptly upon the director's arrival, to holding the meeting
or transacting business at the meeting, (ii) the director's dissent or
abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the
meeting, or (iii) the director delivers written notice of dissent or
abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its
adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the
meeting.  The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a
director who votes in favor of the action taken.

     Section 9.  Compensation.  Directors shall be entitled to such
                 ____________
compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of
Directors, including, without limitation, an annual fee, a fixed sum for
attending each Board and committee meeting, and their expenses of
attendance at each meeting of the Board or a committee.  No such payment
shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other
capacity as an officer, agent, employee, consultant or otherwise and
receiving compensation for that service.


                          ARTICLE 4 - Committees

be reported to the Board of Directors at its meeting next succeeding
such action and shall be subject to approval and revision by the Board,
provided that no legal rights of third parties shall be affected by such
revisions.

     Section 3.  Procedures.  The provisions of Article 3 of these
                 __________
Bylaws governing meetings, notice and waiver of notice, and quorum and
voting requirements of the Board of Directors shall apply to committees

committee shall be appointed by the Board of Directors by resolution and

            ARTICLE 8 - Transactions With Interested Directors

     Section 1.  Validity of Transaction.
                 _______________________

     (a)    No transaction involving the Corporation shall be voidable
by the Corporation solely because of a director's direct or indirect
interest in the transaction if:

           (i)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's
interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors or
committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;

           (ii)  The material facts of the transaction and the
director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled
to vote and the shareholders authorized, approved or ratified the
transaction by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation, or by written consent;
or

           (iii)  The transaction was fair and reasonable to the
Corporation.

     (b)    This Article 8 shall not invalidate any contract,
transaction or determination that would otherwise be valid under
applicable law.

     Section 2.  Indirect Interest.  Solely for purposes of this Article
                 _________________
8, a director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a
transaction if another entity in which the director has a material
financial interest or in which the director is a general partner is a
party to the transaction; or the transaction with another entity of
which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the
transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board
of Directors.

     Section 3.  Authorization by Board.  For purposes of Section 1 of
                 ______________________
this Article 8, a transaction in which a director has an interest is
authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors if it
receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the
Board of Directors, or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect
interest in the transaction.  A transaction may not be authorized,
approved or ratified under this Article 8 by a single director.  If a
majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the
transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a
quorum shall be present for the purpose of taking action under this
Article 8.  The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct
or indirect interest in the transaction shall not affect the validity of
any action taken under Section 1 of this Article 8 by the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof, if the transaction is otherwise
authorized, approved or ratified as provided in Section 1 of this
Article 8.



                                 13
     Section 4.  Authorization by Shareholders.  For purposes of Section
                 _____________________________
1 of this Article 8, a transaction in which a director has an interest
is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote under this Article 8 voting as a
single voting group.  Shares owned by or voted under the control of a
director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and
shares owned by or voted under the control of any entity described in
paragraph (a) of Section 2 of this Article 8 may be counted in a vote of
shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a
transaction by vote of the shareholders under Section 1 of this Article
8.  A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled
to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this Article 8
constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this Article
8.


                       ARTICLE 9 - Indemnification

     (a)    The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any person who is made, or threatened to be made, a
party to or witness in, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative, or otherwise (including any
action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that:

           (i)  the person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;

           (ii)  the person is or was serving as a fiduciary within the
meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with
respect to any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries; or

           (iii)  the person is or was serving, at the request of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as a director or officer, or as
a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan, of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     (b)    The Corporation may indemnify its employees and other agents
to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     (c)    The expenses incurred by a director or officer or other
indemnified person in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative, or otherwise, which the director or
officer is made or threatened to be  made a party to or witness in, or
is otherwise involved in, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance
upon written request if the indemnified person:

           (i)  furnishes the Corporation a written affirmation that in
good faith the person believes that he or she is entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation; and

           (ii)  furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking to
repay such advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a
court that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation.  Such advances shall be made without regard to the person's
ability to repay such expenses and without regard to the person's
ultimate entitlement to indemnification under this Article or otherwise.


                                 14
     (d)    The rights of indemnification provided in this Article 9
shall be in addition to any rights to which a person may otherwise be
entitled under any articles of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, statute,
policy of insurance, vote of shareholders or Board of Directors, or
otherwise; shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation; and shall inure
to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
person.

     (e)    Any repeal of this Article 9 shall be prospective only and
no repeal or modification of this Article 9 shall adversely affect any
right or protection that is based upon this Article 9 and pertains to an
act or omission that occurred prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.

     (f)    As a condition precedent to indemnification under this
Article 9, not later than 30 days after receipt by the director or
officer of notice of the commencement of any proceeding the director or
officer shall, if a claim in respect of the proceeding is to be made
against the Corporation under this Article 9, notify the Corporation in
writing of the commencement of the proceeding.  The failure to properly
notify the Corporation shall not relieve the Corporation from any
liability which it may have to the director or officer otherwise than
under this Article 9.  With respect to any proceeding as to which the
director or officer so notifies the Corporation of the commencement:

           (i)  The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the
proceeding at its own expense.

           (ii)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), the
Corporation may, at its option and jointly with any other indemnifying
party similarly notified and electing to assume such defense, assume the
defense of the proceeding, with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the director or officer.  The director or officer shall have the right
to use separate legal counsel in the proceeding, but the corporation
shall not be liable to the director or officer  under this Article 9 for
the fees and expenses of separate legal counsel incurred after notice
from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense, unless (A) the
director or officer reasonably concludes that there may be a conflict of
interest between the Corporation and the director or officer in the
conduct of the defense of the proceeding, or (B) the Corporation does
not use legal counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding.  The
Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to which the
director or officer has made the conclusion provided for in (A) above.

           (iii)  If two or more persons who may be entitled to
indemnification from the Corporation, including the director or officer
seeking indemnification, are parties to any proceeding, the Corporation
may require the director or officer to use the same legal counsel as the
other parties.  The director or officer shall have the right to use
separate legal counsel in the proceeding, but the Corporation shall not
be liable to the director or officer under this Article 9 for the fees
and expenses of separate legal counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of the requirement to use the same legal counsel as the
other parties, unless the director or officer reasonably concludes that
there may be a conflict of interest between the director or officer and
any of the other parties required by the Corporation to be represented
by the same legal counsel.

           (iv)	 The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify the
director or officer under this Article 9 for any amounts paid in

                                 15
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.  The director or officer shall
permit the Corporation to settle any proceeding that the Corporation
assumes the defense of, except that the Corporation shall not settle any
action or claim in any manner that would impose any penalty or
limitation on the director or officer without such person's written
consent.

     (g)    Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 9, the
Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article 9 to make any
indemnification or advance any expenses in connection with any claim
made against any director or officer:

           (i)  for which payment is required to be made to or on behalf
of the director or officer under any insurance policy, except with
respect to any excess amount to which the director or officer is
entitled under this Article 9 beyond the amount of payment under such
insurance policy;

           (ii) if a court having jurisdiction in the matter finally
determines that such indemnification is not lawful under any applicable
statute or public policy;

           (iii) in connection with any proceeding (or part of any
proceeding) initiated by the director or officer, or any proceeding by
the director or officer against the Corporation or its directors,
officers, employees or other persons entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation, unless: (A) the Corporation is expressly required by law to
make the indemnification; (B) the proceeding was authorized by the Board
of Directors; or (C) the director or officer initiated the proceeding
pursuant to subsection (i) of this Article 9 and the director or officer
is successful in whole or in part in such proceeding; or

           (iv) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and
sale by the director or officer of securities of the Corporation within
the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or similar provision
of any state statutory law or common law.

     (h)    In the event of payment under this Article 9, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of
the rights of recovery of the director or officer.  The director or
officer shall execute all documents required and shall do all acts that
may be necessary to secure such rights and to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

     (i)    Without the necessity of entering into an express contract,
all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and officers
under this Article 9 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract
between the Corporation and the director or officer.  Any director or
officer may enforce any right to indemnification or advances under this
Article 9 in any court of competent jurisdiction if: (i) the Corporation
denies the claim for indemnification or advances, in whole or in part,
or (ii) the Corporation does not dispose of such claim within 45 days of
request therefor.  It shall be a defense to any such enforcement action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of
expenses pursuant to, and in compliance with, this Article 9) that the
director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9.  However, except as provided in subsection (f) of this
Article 9, the Corporation shall not assert any defense to an action
brought to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses pursuant to this
Article 9 if the director or officer has tendered to the Corporation the

                                 16
affirmation and undertaking required hereunder.  The burden of proving
by clear and convincing evidence that indemnification is not appropriate
shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the director or
officer has met the applicable standard of conduct nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or
independent legal counsel) that indemnification is improper because the
director or officer has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall be asserted as a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under
this Article 9 or otherwise.  The director's or officer's expenses
incurred in connection with successfully establishing such person's
right to indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in any
proceeding shall also be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation.

     (j)    The rights conferred on any person by this Article 9 shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

     (k)    To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation,
upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on
behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to
this Article 9.

     (l)    If this Article 9 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated
on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to
the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article
9 that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.


              ARTICLE 10 - Limitation of Director Liability

     To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the
Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Oregon Revised Statutes
are amended, after this Article 10 becomes effective, to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability
of directors of the Corporation, then the liability of directors of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the Oregon Revised Statutes, as so amended.  No amendment
or repeal of this Article 10, nor the adoption of any provision of these
Bylaws inconsistent with this Article 10, nor a change in the law, shall
adversely affect any right or protection that is based upon this Article
10 and pertains to conduct that occurred prior to the time of such
amendment, repeal, adoption or change.  No change in the law shall
reduce or eliminate the rights and protections set forth in this Article
10 unless the change in the law specifically requires such reduction or
elimination.

     1.    Purpose.    The purpose of this Stock Incentive Plan (the
           _______

directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and independent
contractors people of initiative and ability and to provide additional

provided below and in paragraph 10, the shares to be offered under the
Plan shall consist of Class B Common Stock of the Company ("Shares"),
and the total number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan shall
not exceed fifty million (50,000,000) Shares. If an option or stock
appreciation right granted under the Plan expires, terminates or is
canceled, the unissued Shares subject to such option or stock
appreciation right shall again be available under the Plan. If Shares
sold or awarded as a bonus under the Plan are forfeited to the Company
or repurchased by the Company, the number of Shares forfeited or
repurchased shall again be available under the Plan.

     3.    Effective Date and Duration of Plan.
           ___________________________________

    (a)    Effective Date.    The Plan shall become effective when
           ______________
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company. However, no option or
stock appreciation right granted under the Plan shall become exercisable
until the Plan is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Common Stock of the Company represented at a
shareholders meeting at which a quorum is present and any awards under
the Plan prior to such approval shall be conditioned on and subject to
such approval. Subject to this limitation, options and stock
appreciation rights may be granted and Shares may be awarded as bonuses
or sold under the Plan at any time after the effective date and before
termination of the Plan.

     (b)    Duration.    The Plan shall continue in effect until all
            ________
Shares available for issuance under the Plan have been issued and all
restrictions on such Shares have lapsed. The Board of Directors may
suspend or terminate the Plan at any time except with respect to options
and Shares subject to restrictions then outstanding under the Plan.
Termination shall not affect any outstanding options, any right of the
Company to repurchase Shares or the forfeitability of Shares issued
under the Plan.

     4.    Administration.
           ______________

     The Plan shall be administered by a committee appointed by the
Board of Directors of the Company consisting of not less than two
directors (the "Committee"), which shall determine and designate from
time to time the individuals to whom awards shall be made, the amount of
the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards, except that
only the Board of Directors may amend or terminate the Plan as provided
in paragraphs 3 and 13. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the
Committee may from time to time adopt and amend rules and regulations
relating to administration of the Plan, advance the lapse of any waiting
period, accelerate any exercise date, waive or modify any restriction
applicable to Shares (except those restrictions imposed by law) and make
all other determinations in the judgment of the Committee necessary or
desirable for the administration of the Plan. The interpretation and
construction of the provisions of the Plan and related agreements by the
Committee shall be final and conclusive. The Committee may correct any
defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan
or in any related agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall
deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole
and final judge of such expediency. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Paragraph 4, the Board of Directors may
delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as a one-member
committee of the Board of Directors, the authority to grant awards
with respect to a maximum of 50,000 Shares to any eligible employee who
is not, at the time of such grant, subject to the reporting requirements
and liability provisions contained in Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the regulations
thereunder.

     5.    Types of Awards; Eligibility.    The Committee may, from time
           ____________________________
to time, take the following action, separately or in combination, under
the Plan: (i) grant Incentive Stock Options, as defined in Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as
provided in paragraph 6(b); (ii) grant options other than Incentive
Stock Options ("Non-Statutory Stock Options") as provided in paragraph
6(c); (iii) award stock bonuses as provided in paragraph 7; (iv) sell
shares subject to restrictions as provided in paragraph 8; and (v) grant
stock appreciation rights as provided in paragraph 9. Any such awards
may be made to employees, including employees who are officers or
directors, of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the
Company and to other individuals described in paragraph 1 who the
Committee believes have made or will make an important contribution to
the Company or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that only employees
of the Company shall be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options
under the Plan. The Committee shall select the individuals to whom
awards shall be made. The Committee shall specify the action taken with
respect to each individual to whom an award is made under the Plan. No
employee may be granted options or stock appreciation rights under the
Plan for more than 200,000 Shares in any calendar year.

     6.    Option Grants.
           _____________

    (a)    Grant.    The Committee may grant options under the Plan.
           _____
With respect to each option grant, the Committee shall determine the
number of Shares subject to the option, the option price, the period of
the option, the time or times at which the option may be exercised and
whether the option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock
Option.

    (b)    Incentive Stock Options.    Incentive Stock Options shall be
           _______________________
subject to the following terms and conditions:

          (i)    An Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan
to an employee possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any parent or
subsidiary of the Company only if the option price is at least 110
percent of the fair market value of the Shares subject to the option on
the date it is granted, as described in paragraph 6(b)(iii), and the
option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five
years from the date it is granted.

          (ii)    Subject to paragraphs 6(b)(i) and 6(d), Incentive
Stock Options granted under the Plan shall continue in effect for the
period fixed by the Committee, except that no Incentive Stock Option
shall be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date it
is granted.

          (iii)    The option price per share shall be determined by the
Committee at the time of grant. Subject to paragraph 6(b)(i), the option
price shall not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the
Shares covered by the Incentive Stock Option at the date the option is
granted. The fair market value shall be deemed to be the closing price
of the Class B Common Stock of the Company as reported in the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Transactions in the Wall Street Journal on the
day preceding the date the option is granted, or if there has been no
sale on that date, on the last preceding date on which a sale occurred,
or such other reported value of the Class B Common Stock of the Company
as shall be specified by the Committee.

          (iv)    No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted on or after
the tenth anniversary of the last action by the Board of Directors
approving an increase in the number of shares available for issuance
under the Plan, which action was subsequently approved within 12 months
by the shareholders.

    (c)    Non-Statutory Stock Options.    The option price for Non-
           ___________________________
Statutory Stock Options shall be determined by the Committee at the time
of grant. The option price may not be less than 75 percent of the fair
market value of the Shares covered by the Non-Statutory Stock Option on
the date the option is granted. The fair market value of Shares covered
by a Non-Statutory Stock Option shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph 6(b)(iii).

    (d)    Exercise of Options.    Except as provided in paragraph 6(f),
           ___________________
no option granted under the Plan may be exercised unless at the time of
such exercise the optionee is employed by the Company or any parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company and shall have been so employed
continuously since the date such option was granted. Absence on leave or
on account of illness or disability under rules established by the
Committee shall not, however, be deemed an interruption of employment
for this purpose. Except as provided in paragraphs 6(f), 10 and 11,
options granted under the Plan may be exercised from time to time over
the period stated in each option in such amounts and at such times as
shall be prescribed by the Committee, provided that options shall not be
exercised for fractional shares. Unless otherwise determined by the
Committee, if the optionee does not exercise an option in any one year
with respect to the full number of Shares to which the optionee is
entitled in that year, the optionee's rights shall be cumulative and the
optionee may purchase those Shares in any subsequent year during the
term of the option.

    (e)    Nontransferability.    Except as provided below, each stock
           __________________
option granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and
nontransferable by the optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of
law, and each option by its terms shall be exercisable during the
optionee's lifetime only by the optionee. A stock option may be
transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the
state or country of the optionee's domicile at the time of death. A Non-
Statutory Stock Option shall also be transferable pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined under the Code or Title I
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Committee may, in
its discretion, authorize all or a portion of a Non-Statutory Stock
Option granted to an optionee to be on terms which permit transfer by
the optionee to (i) the spouse, children or grandchildren of the
optionee ("Immediate Family Members"), (ii) a trust or trusts for the
exclusive benefit of Immediate Family Members, or (iii) a partnership in
which Immediate Family Members are the only partners, provided that (x)
there may be no consideration for any transfer, (y) the stock option
agreement pursuant to which the options are granted must expressly
provide for transferability in a manner consistent with this paragraph,
and (z) subsequent transfers of transferred options shall be prohibited
except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Following any
transfer, options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, provided
that for purposes of paragraphs 6(d), 6(g), 10 and 11 the term
"optionee" shall be deemed to refer to the transferee. The events of
termination of employment of paragraph 6(f), shall continue to be
applied with respect to the original optionee, following which the
options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and
for the periods specified, and all other references to employment,
termination of employment, life or death of the optionee, shall continue
to be applied with respect to the original optionee.

    (f)    Termination of Employment or Death.
           __________________________________

          (i)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in the
event the employment of the optionee by the Company or a parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company terminates for any reason other
than because of retirement, physical disability or death, the option may
be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or
the expiration of three months after the date of such termination of
employment, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the
extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of
such termination.

          (ii)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in the
event the employment of the optionee by the Company or a parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company terminates as a result of the
optionee's retirement, the option may be exercised by the optionee to
the extent specified in this paragraph 6(f)(ii) at any time prior to the
expiration date of the option or the expiration of three months after
the date of such termination of employment, whichever is the shorter
period. For purposes of this paragraph 6(f), "retirement" means a
termination of employment that occurs at a time when (A) the optionee's
retirement point total is at least 55, and (B) the optionee has at least
five full years of service as an employee of the Company or a parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company. For purposes of this paragraph
6(f), "retirement point total" means the sum of the optionee's age in
full years plus the optionee's full years of service as an employee of
the Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company. Upon
retirement, the optionee may exercise the portion of the option that the
optionee was entitled to exercise immediately prior to retirement plus a
percentage of the remaining unvested portion of the option based on the
optionee's retirement point total at the time of retirement as set forth
in the following table:

                                       Percent of Unvested Option
          Retirement Point Total        That Becomes Exercisable
          ______________________       __________________________
                55 or 56                          20%
                   57                             40%
                   58                             60%
                   59                             80%
                   60                            100%

          (iii)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in
the event the employment of the optionee by the Company or a parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company terminates because the optionee
becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code),
the option may be exercised by the optionee free of the limitations on
the amount that may be purchased in any one year specified in the option
agreement at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or the
expiration of one year after the date of such termination, whichever is
the shorter period.

          (iv)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in the
event of the death of the optionee while in the employ of the Company or
a parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company, the option may be
exercised free of the limitations on the amount that may be purchased in
any one year specified in the option agreement at any time prior to the
expiration date of the option or the expiration of one year after the
date of such death, whichever is the shorter period, but only by the
person or persons to whom such optionee's rights under the option shall
pass by the optionee's will or by the laws of descent and distribution
of the state or country of domicile at the time of death.

          (v)     The Committee, at the time of grant or at any time
thereafter, may extend the three-month and one-year expiration periods
any length of time not later than the original expiration date of the
option, and may increase the portion of an option that is exercisable,
subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.

          (vi)    To the extent that the option of any deceased optionee
or of any optionee whose employment terminates is not exercised within
the applicable period, all further rights to purchase Shares pursuant to
such option shall cease and terminate.

     (g)    Purchase of Shares.    Unless the Committee determines
            __________________
otherwise, Shares may be acquired pursuant to an option granted under
the Plan only upon receipt by the Company of notice in writing from the
optionee of the optionee's intention to exercise, specifying the number
of Shares as to which the optionee desires to exercise the option and
the date on which the optionee desires to complete the transaction, and
if required in order to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, containing a representation that it is the optionee's present
intention to acquire the Shares for investment and not with a view to
distribution. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, on or before
the date specified for completion of the purchase of Shares pursuant to
an option, the optionee must have paid the Company the full purchase
price of such Shares in cash or with the consent of the Committee, in
whole or in part, in Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market
value. The fair market value of Common Stock of the Company provided in
payment of the purchase price shall be the closing price of the Common
Stock of the Company as reported in the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Transactions in the Wall Street Journal or such other reported
value of the Common Stock of the Company as shall be specified by the
Committee, on the date the option is exercised, or if such date is not a
trading day, then on the immediately preceding trading day. No Shares
shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. With the
consent of the Committee, an optionee may request the Company to apply
automatically the Shares to be received upon the exercise of a portion
of a stock option (even though stock certificates have not yet been
issued) to satisfy the purchase price for additional portions of the
option. Each optionee who has exercised an option shall immediately upon
notification of the amount due, if any, pay to the Company in cash
amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax
withholding requirements. If additional withholding is or becomes
required beyond any amount deposited before delivery of the
certificates, the optionee shall pay such amount to the Company on
demand. If the optionee fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company
may withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to
the optionee, including salary, subject to applicable law. With the
consent of the Committee, an optionee may satisfy this obligation, in
whole or in part, by having the Company withhold from the Shares to be
issued upon the exercise that number of Shares that would satisfy the
withholding amount due or by delivering Common Stock of the Company to
the Company to satisfy the withholding amount. Upon the exercise of an
option, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall
be reduced by the number of Shares issued upon exercise of the option.

     7.    Stock Bonuses.    The Committee may award Shares under the
           _____________
Plan as stock bonuses. Shares awarded as a stock bonus shall be subject
to the terms, conditions, and restrictions determined by the Committee.
The restrictions may include restrictions concerning transferability and
forfeiture of the Shares awarded, together with such other restrictions
as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may require the
recipient to sign an agreement as a condition of the award, but may not
require the recipient to pay any monetary consideration other than
amounts necessary to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The agreement
may contain any terms, conditions, restrictions, representations and
warranties required by the Committee. The certificates representing the
Shares awarded shall bear any legends required by the Committee. The
Company may require any recipient of a stock bonus to pay to the Company
in cash upon demand amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal,
state or local tax withholding requirements. If the recipient fails to
pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other
amounts payable by the Company to the recipient, including salary,
subject to applicable law. With the consent of the Committee, a
recipient may deliver Common Stock of the Company to the Company to
satisfy this withholding obligation. Upon the issuance of a stock bonus,
the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be
reduced by the number of Shares issued.

     8.    Restricted Stock.    The Committee may issue Shares under the
           ________________
Plan for such consideration (including promissory notes and services) as
determined by the Committee, provided that in no event shall the
consideration be less than 75 percent of fair market value of the Shares
at the time of issuance. Shares issued under the Plan shall be subject
to the terms, conditions and restrictions determined by the Committee.
The restrictions may include restrictions concerning transferability,
repurchase by the Company and forfeiture of the Shares issued, together
with such other restrictions as may be determined by the Committee. All
Shares issued pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall be subject to a
purchase agreement, which shall be executed by the Company and the
prospective recipient of the Shares prior to the delivery of
certificates representing such Shares to the recipient. The purchase
agreement may contain any terms, conditions, restrictions,
representations and warranties required by the Committee. The
certificates representing the Shares shall bear any legends required by
the Committee. The Company may require any purchaser of restricted stock
to pay to the Company in cash upon demand amounts necessary to satisfy
any applicable federal, state or local tax withholding requirements. If
the purchaser fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold
that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to the purchaser,
including salary, subject to applicable law. With the consent of the
Committee, a purchaser may deliver Common Stock of the Company to the
Company to satisfy this withholding obligation. Upon the issuance of
restricted stock, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the
Plan shall be reduced by the number of Shares issued.

     9.    Stock Appreciation Rights.
           _________________________
    (a)    Grant.    Stock appreciation rights may be granted under the
           _____
Plan by the Committee, subject to such rules, terms, and conditions as
the Committee prescribes.

    (b)    Exercise.
           ________

          (i)    A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable only at
the time or times established by the Committee. If a stock appreciation
right is granted in connection with an option, the stock appreciation
right shall be exercisable only to the extent and on the same conditions
that the related option could be exercised. Upon exercise of a stock
appreciation right, any option or portion thereof to which the stock
appreciation right relates terminates. If a stock appreciation right is
granted in connection with an option, upon exercise of the option, the
stock appreciation right or portion thereof to which the option relates
terminates.

          (ii)   The Committee may withdraw any stock appreciation
right granted under the Plan at any time and may impose any conditions
upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or adopt rules and
regulations from time to time affecting the rights of holders of stock
appreciation rights. Such rules and regulations may govern the right to
exercise stock appreciation rights granted before adoption or amendment
of such rules and regulations as well as stock appreciation rights
granted thereafter.

          (iii)  Each stock appreciation right shall entitle the holder,
upon exercise, to receive from the Company in exchange therefor an
amount equal in value to the excess of the fair market value on the date
of exercise of one share of Class B Common Stock of the Company over its
fair market value on the date of grant (or, in the case of a stock
appreciation right granted in connection with an option, the option
price per Share under the option to which the stock appreciation right
relates), multiplied by the number of Shares covered by the stock
appreciation right or the option, or portion thereof, that is
surrendered. Payment by the Company upon exercise of a stock
appreciation right may be made in Shares valued at fair market value, in
cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, all as determined by the
Committee.

          (iv)   For purposes of this paragraph 9, the fair market value
of the Class B Common Stock of the Company on the date a stock
appreciation right is exercised shall be the closing price of the Class
B Common Stock of the Company as reported in the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Transactions in the Wall Street Journal, or such other
reported value of the Class B Common Stock of the Company as shall be
specified by the Committee, on the date the stock appreciation right is
exercised, or if such date is not a trading day, then on the immediately
preceding trading day.

          (v)    No fractional shares shall be issued upon exercise of a
stock appreciation right. In lieu thereof, cash shall be paid in an
amount equal to the value of the fractional share.

          (vi)   Each stock appreciation right granted under the Plan by
its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the holder,
either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws
of descent and distribution of the state or county of the holder's
domicile at the time of death, and each stock appreciation right by its
terms shall be exercisable during the holder's lifetime only by the
holder; provided, however, that a stock appreciation right not granted
in connection with an Incentive Stock Option shall also be transferable
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined under the
Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

          (vii)  Each participant who has exercised a stock appreciation
right shall, upon notification of the amount due, pay to the Company in
cash amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state or local
tax withholding requirements. If the participant fails to pay the amount
demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other amounts
payable by the Company to the participant including salary, subject to
applicable law. With the consent of the Committee a participant may
satisfy this obligation, in whole or in part, by having the Company
withhold from any Shares to be issued upon the exercise that number of
Shares that would satisfy the withholding amount due or by delivering
Common Stock of the Company to the Company to satisfy the withholding
amount.

          (viii) Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right for
Shares, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall
be reduced by the number of Shares issued. Cash payments of stock
appreciation rights shall not reduce the number of Shares reserved for
issuance under the Plan.

     10.    Changes in Capital Structure.    If the outstanding shares
            ____________________________
of Common Stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
other securities of the Company or of another corporation by reason of
any reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of exchange,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, combination of
shares or dividend payable in shares, appropriate adjustment shall be
made by the Committee in the number and kind of shares available for
awards under the Plan, provided that this paragraph 10 shall not apply
with respect to transactions referred to in paragraph 11. In addition,
the Committee shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind
of shares as to which outstanding options and stock appreciation rights,
or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end
that the optionee's proportionate interest is maintained as before the
occurrence of such event. The Committee may also require that any
securities issued in respect of or exchanged for Shares issued hereunder
that are subject to restrictions be subject to similar restrictions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have no obligation to
effect any adjustment that would or might result in the issuance of
fractional shares, and any fractional shares resulting from any
adjustment may be disregarded or provided for in any manner determined
by the Committee. Any such adjustments made by the Committee shall be
conclusive. In the event of a merger, consolidation or plan of exchange
affecting the Company to which paragraph 11 does not apply, in lieu of
providing for options and stock appreciation rights as provided above in
this paragraph 10, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a
30-day period prior to such event during which optionees shall have the
right to exercise options and stock appreciation rights in whole or in
part without any limitation on exercisability and upon the expiration of
such 30-day period all unexercised options and stock appreciation rights
shall immediately terminate.

     11.    Special Acceleration in Certain Events.
            ______________________________________

    (a)    Special Acceleration.    Notwithstanding any other provisions
           ____________________
of the Plan, a special acceleration ("Special Acceleration") of options
and stock appreciation rights outstanding under the Plan shall occur
with the effect set forth in paragraph 11(b) at any time when the
shareholders of the Company approve one of the following ("Approved
Transactions"):

          (i)    Any consolidation, merger, plan of exchange, or
transaction involving the Company ("Merger") in which the Company is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which the Common
Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other
property, other than a Merger involving the Company in which the holders
of the Common Stock of the Company immediately prior to the Merger have
the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving
corporation after the Merger; or

          (ii)   Any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one
transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or the adoption of any plan or proposal
for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

     (b)    Effect on Outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
            ___________________________________________________________
Except as provided below in this paragraph 11(b), upon a Special
Acceleration pursuant to paragraph 11(a), all options and stock
appreciation rights then outstanding under the Plan shall immediately
become exercisable in full during the remainder of their terms;
provided, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a 30-day
period prior to an Approved Transaction during which optionees shall
have the right to exercise options and stock appreciation rights, in
whole or in part, without any limitation on exercisability, and upon the
expiration of such 30-day period all unexercised options and stock
appreciation rights shall immediately terminate.

     12.    Corporate Mergers, Acquisitions, etc.    The Committee may
            ____________________________________
also grant options, stock appreciation rights, and stock bonuses and
issue restricted stock under the Plan having terms, conditions and
provisions that vary from those specified in this Plan, provided that
any such awards are granted in substitution for, or in connection with
the assumption of, existing options, stock appreciation rights, stock
bonuses, and restricted stock, awarded or issued by another corporation
and assumed or otherwise agreed to be provided for by the Company
pursuant to or by reason of a transaction involving a corporate merger,
consolidation, plan of exchange, acquisition of property or stock,
separation, reorganization or liquidation to which the Company or a
parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company is a party.

     13.    Amendment of Plan.    The Board of Directors may at any
            _________________
time, and from time to time, modify or amend the Plan in such respects
as it shall deem advisable because of changes in the law while the Plan
is in effect or for any other reason. Except as provided in paragraphs
6(f), 9, 10 and 11, however, no change in an award already granted shall
be made without the written consent of the holder of such award.

     14.    Approvals.    The obligations of the Company under the Plan
            _________
are subject to the approval of state and federal authorities or agencies
with jurisdiction in the matter. The Company will use its best efforts
to take steps required by state or federal law or applicable
regulations, including rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or trading system on which
the Company's shares may then be listed or admitted for trading, in
connection with the grants under the Plan. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or deliver
Class B Common Stock under the Plan if such issuance or delivery would
violate applicable state or federal securities laws.

     15.    Employment and Service Rights.    Nothing in the Plan or any
            _____________________________
award pursuant to the Plan shall (i) confer upon any employee any right
to be continued in the employment of the Company or any parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company or shall interfere in any way with
the right of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the
Company by whom such employee is employed to terminate such employee's
employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, or to
increase or decrease such employee's compensation or benefits, or (ii)
confer upon any person engaged by the Company any right to be retained
or employed by the Company or to the continuation, extension, renewal,
or modification of any compensation, contract, or arrangement with or by
the Company.

     16.    Rights as a Shareholder.    The recipient of any award under
            _______________________
the Plan shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any
Shares until the date of issue to the recipient of a stock certificate
for such Shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no
adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the
record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.

1.  I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of NIKE, Inc.;

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

4.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for

Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
